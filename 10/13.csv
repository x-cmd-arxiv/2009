turbulence on the mean Lorentz force and the resulting formation of large-scale
magnetic structures. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS)
of forced turbulence we show that an imposed mean magnetic field leads to a
decrease of the turbulent hydromagnetic pressure and tension. This phenomenon
is quantified by determining the relevant functions that relate the sum of the
turbulent Reynolds and Maxwell stresses with the Maxwell stress of the mean
magnetic field. Using such a parameterization, we show by means of
two-dimensional and three-dimensional mean-field numerical modelling that an
isentropic density stratified layer becomes unstable in the presence of a
uniform imposed magnetic field. This large-scale instability results in the
formation of loop-like magnetic structures which are concentrated at the top of
the stratified layer. In three dimensions these structures resemble the
appearance of bipolar magnetic regions in the Sun. The results of DNS and
mean-field numerical modelling are in good agreement with theoretical
predictions. We discuss our model in the context of a distributed solar dynamo
where active regions and sunspots might be rather shallow phenomena.

gelaton, has an effective potential which depends on the kinetic energy of the
inflaton. Integrating out the gelaton gives rise to an effectively single field
system for which the speed of sound for the adiabatic fluctuations is reduced,
generating potentially observable equilateral non-Gaussianity, while causing
negligible isocurvature fluctuations. This mechanism is only active if there is
a relatively tight coupling between the gelaton and the inflaton, and this puts
an upper limit on the mass of the gelaton for which the inflaton-gelaton system
remains weakly coupled. This approach gives a UV-completable framework for

degree of a real polynomial p such that f(x)=sgn p(x). We construct two
halfspaces on {0,1}^n whose intersection has threshold degree Theta(sqrt n), an
exponential improvement on previous lower bounds. This solves an open problem
due to Klivans (2002) and rules out the use of perceptron-based techniques for
PAC learning the intersection of two halfspaces, a central unresolved challenge
in computational learning. We also prove that the intersection of two majority
functions has threshold degree Omega(log n), which is tight and settles a
conjecture of O'Donnell and Servedio (2003).
  Our proof consists of two parts. First, we show that for any nonconstant
Boolean functions f and g, the intersection f(x)^g(y) has threshold degree O(d)
if and only if ||f-F||_infty + ||g-G||_infty < 1 for some rational functions F,
G of degree O(d). Second, we settle the least degree required for approximating
a halfspace and a majority function to any given accuracy by rational
functions.
  Our technique further allows us to make progress on Aaronson's challenge

representations of composed Boolean functions of the form F(f_1,...,f_n). In
particular, we give an improved lower bound on the approximate degree of the

function. A self-randomized modulation code is proposed which is asymptotically
optimal, as, for an arbitrary input alphabet and i.i.d. input distribution.
  In practical flash memory systems, the number of cell-levels is only
moderately large. So the asymptotic performance as may not tell the whole
story. Using the tools from load-balancing theory, we analyze the storage
efficiency of the self-randomized modulation code. The result shows that only a

moderately large. We also propose a load-balancing modulation code, based on a
phenomenon known as ""the power of two random choices"" [Mitzenmacher96thepower],
to improve the storage efficiency of practical systems. Theoretical analysis
and simulation results show that our load-balancing modulation codes can
provide significant gain to practical flash memory storage systems. Though
pseudo-random, our approach achieves the same load-balancing performance, for

repeatedly return to populations with complex and changing patterns of

two mathematical approaches for modeling consecutive seasonal outbreaks of a
partially-immunizing infection in a population with contact heterogeneity.
Using methods from percolation theory we consider both leaky immunity, where
all previously infected individuals gain partial immunity, and perfect
immunity, where a fraction of previously infected individuals are fully immune.
By restructuring the epidemiologically active portion of their host population,
such diseases limit the potential of future outbreaks. We speculate that these

constraints on the maximum convection velocity in the halo. For a half halo

radioactive isotopes cannot be met. The ROSAT Galactic wind observations of
wind speeds up to 760 km/s therefore constitute a problem for diffusion models.
It is shown that such wind speeds are possible, if the diffusion coefficient in
the halo is different from the diffusion coefficient in the disk. The radial
dependence of the wind velocity was taken to be proportional to the source
strength, as expected from winds which are sustained by cosmic ray pressure. In
this case the cosmic ray density and with it the diffuse $\gamma$-ray
production from nuclear interactions are suppressed near the sources. This
solves in a natural way the problem of the soft gradient in the radial

predefined specifications. We present a novel algorithm to compute such finite
state models for nonlinear discrete-time and sampled systems which depends on
quantizing the state space using polyhedral cells, embedding these cells into
suitable supersets whose attainable sets are convex, and over-approximating
attainable sets by intersections of supporting half-spaces. We prove a novel
recursive description of these half-spaces and propose an iterative procedure
to compute them efficiently. We also provide new sufficient conditions for the
convexity of attainable sets which imply the existence of the aforementioned
embeddings of quantizer cells. Our method yields highly accurate abstractions
and applies to nonlinear systems under mild assumptions, which reduce to
sufficient smoothness in the case of sampled systems. Its practicability in the
design of discrete controllers for nonlinear continuous plants under state and
control constraints is demonstrated by an example.

affinity (NEA). The significance of the result is that not only does it prove
the utilisation of NEA as the dominant factor for the extremely low-threshold
electron emission from heavily N-doped CVD diamond, but also strongly implies
that such low-threshold emission is possible from other types of diamond, and
even other materials having NEA surface. The low-threshold voltage, along with
the stable intensity and remarkably narrow energy width, suggests that this

theory of high Tc superconductivity: (1) How is the physics of the doped region
connected to that of the Mott insulator? (2) What is the origin of the
two-dimensionality of the normal state? Specifically, based on the t-J model,
we derive a renormalized Hamiltonian to describe the properties of underdoped
cuprates. The theory is constrained to agree with the behavior at half filling,
which is well described by the bosonic RVB state of Arovas and Auerbach. Moving
holes are assumed to destroy long-range magnetic order, which leads to a gap in
the spinon spectrum. The presence of the spin gap allows us to derive a
constrained Hamiltonian which describes sublattice-preserving hopping by
renormalized holons and holon pairs, accompanied by spinon singlet backflows.
Below the singlet condensation, i.e, the psudogap (as distinct from the spin
gap), temperature T*, holons form a spinless Fermi liquid without an observable
small Fermi surface. Above T* holons are localized, giving rise to a (gauge)
insulator, which we identify with the strange metal phase. Holon pair hopping
leads to a robust d-wave superconductor, its symmetry determined primarily by
the symmetry of the RVB state at half filling. The predictions of the theory
are shown to be consistent with the results of nmr, tunneling and transport
experiments. Remarkably, the existence of the spin gap provides a natural
explanation for the two-dimensionality of the normal state. The marked
asymmetry between hole-doped and electron-doped cuprates is also easily
explained.

  Conference 2010",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes the application of particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
the problem of finite element model (FEM) selection. This problem arises when a
choice of the best model for a system has to be made from set of competing
models, each developed a priori from engineering judgment. PSO is a
population-based stochastic search algorithm inspired by the behaviour of
biological entities in nature when they are foraging for resources. Each
potentially correct model is represented as a particle that exhibits both
individualistic and group behaviour. Each particle moves within the model
search space looking for the best solution by updating the parameters values
that define it. The most important step in the particle swarm algorithm is the
method of representing models which should take into account the number,
location and variables of parameters to be updated. One example structural
system is used to show the applicability of PSO in finding an optimal FEM. An
optimal model is defined as the model that has the least number of updated
parameters and has the smallest parameter variable variation from the mean
material properties. Two different objective functions are used to compare
performance of the PSO algorithm.

occurrence of continuous phase transitions. For the $0.5<q\leq 1.0$ regime, we
have found continuous phase transitions between the ordered and the disordered

verified that the critical exponents $\alpha $, $\beta $ and $\gamma $ depend
on the entropic index $q$ in the range $0.5<q\leq 1.0$ in the form $\alpha

optimize our signature selection we arrive at three ensembles of observables
targeted at the physics of the gaugino sector, allowing for a determination of
this non-universality parameter without reconstructing individual mass
eigenvalues or the soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses themselves. In
this controlled environment we find that approximately 80% of the

explanation is that the relative motion of the bright points twists the

waves may then spiral upwards guided by the magnetic flux structure, thereby
producing the observed intensity signature of Doppler-shifted ring fragments.

fits to the optical-NIR SEDs and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies
indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely

interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star-forming

dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue

quarks and flavor-antisymmetric diquarks. The outcome is a new classification
of the entire meson spectrum into quark-antiquark and diquark-antidiquark
states which does not give rise to a radial quantum number: all mesons which
have so far been believed to be radially excited are orbitally excited
diquark-antidiquark states; similarly, there are no radially excited baryons.
Further, mesons that were previously viewed as ""exotic"" are no longer exotic as
they are now naturally integrated into the classification as
diquark-antidiquark states. The classification also leads to the introduction
of isorons (iso-hadrons), which are analogs of atomic isotopes, and their magic
quantum numbers, which are analogs of the magic numbers of the nuclear shell
model. The magic quantum numbers of isorons match the quantum numbers expected
for low-lying glueballs in lattice QCD. We observe that interquark forces in
mesons behave substantially differently from those in baryons: qualitatively,
they are color-magnetic in mesons but color-electrostatic in baryons. We
comment on potential models and the hydrogen atom. The implications of our
results for confinement, asymptotic freedom, and a new set of relations between
two fundamental properties of hadrons - their size and their energy - are
discussed in our companion paper [arXiv:0910.2231].

below (Delta log M_BH=-2), on (Delta log M_BH=0) and above (Delta log M_BH=0.5)
the observed local relations. The final relations are rapidly established after
the final coalescense of the galaxies and their BHs. Progenitors with low
initial gas fractions (f_gas=0.2) starting below the relations evolve onto the
relations (Delta log M_BH=-0.18), progenitors on the relations stay there
(Delta log M_BH=0) and finally progenitors above the relations evolve towards
the relations, but still remaining above them (Delta log M_BH=0.35). Mergers in
which the progenitors have high initial gas fractions (f_gas=0.8) evolve above
the relations in all cases (Delta log M_BH=0.5). We find that the initial gas
fraction is the prime source of scatter in the observed relations, dominating
over the scatter arising from the evolutionary stage of the merger remnants.
The fact that BHs starting above the relations do not evolve onto the
relations, indicates that our simulations rule out the scenario in which
overmassive BHs evolve onto the relations through gas-rich mergers. By
implication our simulations thus disfavor the picture in which supermassive BHs
develop significantly before their parent bulges.

very far from the unified scale, the Higgs boson mass lies in the range 128-141
GeV. The end points of this range are tightly determined. Theories with the
Higgs boson dominantly in a single supermultiplet predict a mass at the upper
edge, (141 \pm 2) GeV, with the uncertainty dominated by the experimental
errors on the top quark mass and the QCD coupling. This edge prediction is
remarkably insensitive to the supersymmetry breaking scale and to
supersymmetric threshold corrections so that, in a wide class of theories, the
theoretical uncertainties are at the level of \pm 0.4 GeV. A reduction in the
uncertainties from the top quark mass and QCD coupling to the level of \pm 0.3
GeV may be possible at future colliders, increasing the accuracy of the
confrontation with theory from 1.4% to 0.4%. Verification of this prediction
would provide strong evidence for supersymmetry, broken at a very high scale of
~ 10^{14 \pm 2} GeV, and also for a Higgs boson that is elementary up to this
high scale, implying fine-tuning of the Higgs mass parameter by ~ 20-28 orders
of magnitude. Currently, the only known explanation for such fine-tuning is the

good agreement between the predicted and observed exponents, especially for

surface density, as indicated by observations of the star-forming clumps within
molecular clouds. We also consider a variety of specific feedback mechanisms,
concluding that HII regions inflated by radiation pressure predominate in
massive protoclusters, a momentum-limited process when photons can escape after
only a few interactions with dust grains. We then present a first estimate of
the star formation efficiency in this case, finding that it depends on the
masses and sizes of the protoclusters only through their mean surface density,

collisions with a small population ($<$ 1%) of supra-thermal electrons. Mass
and energy are lost due to radial diffusion, escaping fast neutrals produced by
charge exchange and recombination, and a small amount of radiative cooling. We
explore a constrained parameter space spanned by water source rate, ion radial
diffusion, hot-electron temperature, and hot-electron density. The key findings

SN 2007bg and SN 2007bi discovered in wide-field, non-targeted surveys and
associated with sub-luminous blue dwarf galaxies. Neither SNe 2007bg nor 2007bi
were found in association with an observed GRB, but are found to inhabit
similar low-metallicity environments as GRB associated supernovae. The
radio-bright SN 2007bg is hosted by an extremely sub-luminous galaxy of
magnitude MB = -12.4+/-0.6 mag with an estimated oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H) = 8.18+/-0.17. The lightcurve of SN 2007bg displays one of the
fastest post-maximum decline rates of all broad-lined Type Ic supernovae known
to date and, when combined with its high expansion velocities, a high kinetic
energy to ejected mass ratio (E_K/Mej ~ 2.7). We show that SN 2007bi is
possibly the most luminous Type Ic known, reaching a peak magnitude of MR ~
21.3 mag and displays a remarkably slow decline, following the radioactive
decay rate of 56Co to 56Fe throughout the course of its observed lifetime. From
a simple model of the bolometric light curve of SN 2007bi we estimate a total
ejected 56Ni mass of M_Ni = 3.5 - 4.5 solar masses, the largest 56Ni mass
measured in the ejecta of a supernova to date. There are two models that could
explain the high luminosity and large ejected 56Ni mass. One is a
pair-instability supernova (PISN) which has been predicted to occur for massive
stars at low metallicities. We measure the host galaxy metallicity of SN 2007bi
to be 12 + log(O/H) = 8.15+/-0.15 which is somewhat high to be consistent with
the PISN model. An alternative is the core-collapse of a C+O star of 20 - 40
solar masses which is the core of a star of originally 50 - 100 solar masses.

circles of the previously unidentified EGRET sources 3EG J1048-5840 and 3EG

J1048-5832 shows two sharp peaks at phases 0.15 \pm 0.01 and 0.57 \pm 0.01

exponential cutoffs near 3 GeV, leading to integral photon fluxes of (2.19 \pm

through the preparation of specific vibrational coherences prior to electronic
excitation, and its observation by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry.
Laser-driven coherent nuclear motion can affect the instantaneous resonance
between site-excited electronic states and thereby influence short-time
electronic excitation transfer (EET). We first illustrate this control
mechanism with calculations on a dimer whose constituent monomers undergo
harmonic vibrations. We then consider the use of nonlinear wave-packet
interferometry (nl-WPI) experiments to monitor the nuclear dynamics
accompanying EET in general dimer complexes following impulsive vibrational
excitation by a sub-resonant control pulse (or control pulse sequence). In
measurements of this kind, two pairs of polarized phase-related femtosecond
pulses following the control pulse generate superpositions of coherent nuclear
wave packets in optically accessible electronic states. Interference
contributions to the time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence signal due to
overlaps among the superposed wave packets provide amplitude-level information
on the nuclear and electronic dynamics. We derive the basic expression for a
control-pulse-dependent nl-WPI signal. The electronic transition moments of the
constituent monomers are assumed to have a fixed relative orientation, while
the overall orientation of the complex is distributed isotropically. We include
the limiting case of coincident arrival by pulses within each phase-related
pair in which control-influenced nl-WPI reduces to a fluorescence-detected
pump-probe difference experiment. Numerical calculations of pump-probe signals
based on these theoretical expressions are presented in the following paper.

spectroscopic evidence for non-equilibrium chemistry associated with vertical
mixing, all point to a fundamental role for dynamics in vertical abundance
distributions and cloud/grain formation cycles. For exoplanets, azimuthal heat
variations and the detection of stratospheric and exospheric layers indicate
multi-layered, asymmetric atmospheres that may also be time-variable
(particularly for systems with highly elliptical orbits). Dust and clouds may
also play an important role in the thermal energy balance of exoplanets through
albedo effects. For all of these cases, 3D atmosphere models are becoming an
increasingly essential tool for understanding spectral and temporal properties.

PbZnVO(PO4)2 are studied using x-ray powder diffraction, magnetization and

compound resembles AA'VO(PO4)2 vanadium phosphates and fits to the extended
frustrated square lattice model with the couplings J(1), J(1)' between
nearest-neighbors and J(2), J(2)' between next-nearest-neighbors. The
temperature dependence of the magnetization yields estimates of averaged
nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, J(1) ~ -5.2 K and J(2) ~
10.0 K, respectively. The effective frustration ratio alpha=J(2)/J(1) amounts
to -1.9 and suggests columnar antiferromagnetic ordering in PbZnVO(PO4)2.
Specific heat data support the estimates of J(1) and J(2) and indicate a likely
magnetic ordering transition at 3.9 K. However, the averaged couplings
underestimate the saturation field, thus pointing to the spatial anisotropy of
the nearest-neighbor interactions. Band structure calculations confirm the
identification of ferromagnetic J(1), J(1)' and antiferromagnetic J(2), J(2)'
in PbZnVO(PO4)2 and yield J(1)'-J(1) ~ 1.1 K in excellent agreement with the
experimental value of 1.1 K, deduced from the difference between the expected
and experimentally measured saturation fields. Based on the comparison of
layered vanadium phosphates with different metal cations, we show that a
moderate spatial anisotropy of the frustrated square lattice has minor
influence on the thermodynamic properties of the model. We discuss relevant
geometrical parameters, controlling the exchange interactions in these
compounds, and propose a new route towards strongly frustrated square lattice
materials.

that the emission regions of Irr galaxies classified as DIG in the literature

around and into a star cluster with three small, bright HII regions. Higher
resolution (0.4'') observations with the Submillimeter Array in hot core
molecules (CH_3CN, OCS, and SO_2) and the VLA in NH_3, show that the two
brightest and smallest HII regions are themselves surrounded by smaller scale
(0.05 pc) accretion flows. The axes of rotation of the large- and small-scale
flows are aligned, and the timescale for the contraction of the cloud is short
enough, 0.1 Myr, for the large-scale accretion flow to deliver significant mass
to the smaller scales within the star formation timescale. The flow structure
appears to be continuous and hierarchical from larger to smaller scales.
  Millimeter radio recombination line (RRL) observations at 0.4"" angular
resolution indicate rotation and outflow of the ionized gas within the
brightest HII region (A). The broad recombination lines and a continuum
spectral energy distribution (SED) that rises continuously from cm to mm
wavelengths, are both characteristic of the class of HII regions known as
""broad recombination line objects"". The SED indicates a density gradient inside
this HII region, and the RRLs suggest supersonic flows. These observations are
consistent with photoevaporation of the inner part of the rotationally
flattened molecular accretion flow.

Within a sample of isotropically oriented dimers having a specified internal
geometry, a vibrational mode internal to the acceptor chromophore can be
preferentially driven by electronically nonresonant impulsive stimulated Raman
(or resonant infrared) excitation with a short polarized control pulse. A
subsequent electronically resonant polarized pump then preferentially excites
the donor, and EET ensues. Here we test both the control strategy and its
spectroscopic investigation-with some sacrifice of amplitude-level detail-by
calculating the pump-probe difference signal. That signal is the limiting case
of the control-influenced nl-WPI signal in which the two pulses in the pump
pulse-pair coincide, as do the two pulses in the probe pulse-pair. We present
calculated pump-probe difference signals for (1) a model excitation-transfer

Mini = 15 +/- 2 Msun for this star, which is within the expected mass range for
SN II-P progenitors. The yellower color could also arise from the blend of two
or more stars, such as a red supergiant hidden by a brighter, blue supergiant;
or a massive, interacting binary system. Finally, if the yellow supergiant is
not the progenitor, or is not a stellar blend or binary containing the

supergiant with Mini < 11 Msun, considering a physically more realistic

technique, termed \BoostMetric, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One
of the primary difficulties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the
Mahalanobis matrix remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is
sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well.
\BoostMetric is instead based on a key observation that any positive
semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of
trace-one rank-one matrices. \BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive
semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable
boosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement,
does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints.
Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares
favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy
and running time.

Velocity-selective excitation to the 5D level via step-wise and two-photon
processes results in a Doppler-free dependence on the frequency detuning of the
applied laser fields from the respective dipole-allowed transitions. Possible

combines the reliability of belief propagation at high temperatures with the

eliminates the inter-user interference in downlink multiuser multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we apply BD to the downlink
transmission in a cooperative multi-cell MIMO system, where the signals from
different base stations (BSs) to all the mobile stations (MSs) are jointly
designed with the perfect knowledge of the downlink channels and transmit
messages. Specifically, we study the optimal BD precoder design to maximize the
weighted sum-rate of all the MSs subject to a set of per-BS power constraints.
This design problem is formulated in an auxiliary MIMO broadcast channel (BC)
with a set of transmit power constraints corresponding to those for individual
BSs in the multi-cell system. By applying convex optimization techniques, this
paper develops an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, and derives the
closed-form expression for the optimal BD precoding matrix. It is revealed that
the optimal BD precoding vectors for each MS in the per-BS power constraint
case are in general non-orthogonal, which differs from the conventional
orthogonal BD precoder design for the MIMO-BC under one single sum-power
constraint. Moreover, for the special case of single-antenna BSs and MSs, the
proposed solution reduces to the optimal zero-forcing beamforming (ZF-BF)
precoder design for the weighted sum-rate maximization in the multiple-input
single-output (MISO) BC with per-antenna power constraints. Suboptimal and
low-complexity BD/ZF-BF precoding schemes are also presented, and their
achievable rates are compared against those with the optimal schemes.

observed Li in a sample of Sub-Giant stars of the same B-V colour. Our final
sample is composed of 84 SG stars and 79 MS stars. In spite of the fact that SG
and MS span the same temperature range we find that the equivalent widths of
the Li I doublet in SG stars are systematically larger than those in MS stars,
suggesting a higher Li content among SG stars. This is confirmed by our
quantitative analysis which makes use of both 1D and 3D model atmospheres. We
find that SG stars show, on average, a Li abundance higher by 0.1 dex than MS
stars. We also detect a positive slope of Li abundance with effective
temperature, the higher the temperature the higher the Li abundance, both for
SG and MS stars, although the slope is slightly steeper for MS stars. These
results provide an unambigous evidence that the Li abundance changes with
evolutionary status. The physical mechanisms that contribute to this are not
yet clear, since none of the proposed models seem to describe accurately the
observations. Whether such mechanism can explain the cosmological lithium
problem, is still an open question.

counter a possible objection. We show that the rule is the generalization of a

correlation between measurement outcomes is physically backed by a
causal/deterministic/local process with causality allowed to go backward in
time with backdated state vector reduction. The possible objection is that
quantum algorithms often produce the solution of the problem in an apparently
deterministic way (when their unitary part produces an eigenstate of the
observable to be measured and measurement produces the corresponding eigenvalue
- the solution - with probability 1), while the present explanation of the
speed up relies on the nondeterministic character of quantum measurement. We
show that this objection would mistake the nondeterministic production of a

one replaces a smooth, complex $G$-variety $X$ by its associated arc space
$J_{\infty} X$, with its induced $G$-action. This not only allows us to obtain
geometric classes in equivariant cohomology of arbitrarily high degree, but
also provides more flexibility for equivariantly deforming classes and
geometrically interpreting multiplication in the equivariant cohomology ring.
Under appropriate hypotheses, we obtain explicit bijections between
$\mathbb{Z}$-bases for the equivariant cohomology rings of smooth varieties
related by an equivariant, proper birational map. We also show that
self-intersection classes can be represented as classes of contact loci, under
certain restrictions on singularities of subvarieties.

self-intersection and contact loci, we define higher-order equivariant

involve the explicit or implicit computation of the so-called cutpoints of (the
tight span of) $D$, such as the algorithm for computing the ""building blocks""
of optimal realizations of $D$ recently presented by A. Hertz and S. Varone.
The main result of this paper is an algorithm for computing the set of these
cutpoints for a metric $D$ on a finite set with $n$ elements in $O(n^3)$ time.
As a direct consequence, this improves the run time of the aforementioned

(SPF) of the thermal Wilson loop and can be shown to satisfy the
Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the heavy $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in the thermal medium.
In general, the proper potential has a real and an imaginary part,corresponding
to the peak position and width of the SPF. The validity of using a
Schr\""{o}dinger equation for heavy $Q\bar{Q}$ can also be checked from the
structure of the SPF. To test this idea, quenched QCD simulations on
anisotropic lattices ($a_\sigma=4a_\tau=0.039\rm fm$, $N^3_\sigma \times
N_{\tau} =20^2 \times (96-32)$) are performed. The real part of the proper
potential below the deconfinement temperature ($T=0.78T_c$) exhibits the well
known Coulombic and confining behavior. At ($T=2.33T_c$) we find that it
coincides with the Debye screened potential obtained from Polyakov-line

the above restriction of ""rank two"" can be eliminated; i.e., is cyclic symmetry
alone sufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator? The
motivation behind this question is that, if this were true, it would imply that
one could realize a device-independent and unconditionally secure quantum key

moreover, one can instead prove a no-go theorem that any symmetry is, by
itself, insufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator.

attention as a detected TeV gamma-ray and possible ultra-high energy (UHE)
cosmic-ray emitter. Aims: We investigate the efficiency of particle
acceleration close to the supermassive black hole (BH) horizon assuming that
accretion in the innermost part of the disk occurs in an advection-dominated
(ADAF) mode. Methods: We analyze the constraints on the achievable particle
energies imposed by radiative losses and corotation for conditions inferred
from observations. Results: We show that for an underluminous source such as
Cen A, centrifugally accelerated electrons may reach Lorentz factors of up to
$\gamma \sim (10^7-10^8)$, allowing inverse Compton (Thomson) upscattering of
ADAF sub-mm disk photons into the TeV regime with an associated maximum
(isotropic) luminosity of the order of a few times $10^{39}$ erg/s.
Upscattering of Comptonized disk photons is expected to lead to a TeV spectrum
$L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-\alpha_c}$ with a spectral index $\alpha_c \simeq
(1.5-1.9)$, consistent with H.E.S.S. results. The corresponding minimum
variability timescale could be as low as $r_{\rm L}/c \sim 1$ hr for a typical
light cylinder radius of $r_{\rm L} \simeq 5 r_{\rm s}$. While efficient
electron acceleration appears to be well possible, protons are unlikely to be
accelerated into the extreme UHECR regime close to the central black hole. We
argue that if Cen A is indeed an extreme UHECR emitting source, then shear
acceleration along the kpc-scale jet could represent one of the most promising
mechanisms capable of pushing protons up to energies beyond 50 EeV.

facilities which concentrate more and more energy in millimetric volumes allows
the astrophysical community to reproduce and to explore, in millimeter-scale
targets and during very short times, astrophysical phenomena where radiation
and matter are strongly coupled. The astrophysical relevance of these
experiments can be checked from the similarity properties and especially
scaling laws establishment, which constitutes the keystone of laboratory
astrophysics. From the radiating optically thin regime to the so-called
optically thick radiative pressure regime, we present in this paper, for the
first time, a complete analysis of the main radiating regimes that we
encountered in laboratory astrophysics with the same formalism based on the
Lie-group theory. The use of the Lie group method appears as systematic which
allows to construct easily and orderly the scaling laws of a given problem.
This powerful tool permits to unify the recent major advances on scaling laws
and to identify new similarity concepts that we discuss in this paper and which
opens important applications for the present and the future laboratory
astrophysics experiments. All these results enable to demonstrate theoretically
that astrophysical phenomena in such radiating regimes can be explored
experimentally thanks to powerful facilities. Consequently the results
presented here are a fundamental tool for the high-energy density laboratory
astrophysics community in order to quantify the astrophysics relevance and
justify laser experiments. Moreover, relying on the Lie-group theory, this
paper constitutes the starting point of any analysis of the self-similar
dynamics of radiating fluids.

explicit enumeration of extremely long Hamiltonian walks of different types:
closed and open, with end-points anywhere in the lattice, or with one or both
ends fixed at the corner sites, as well as some Hamiltonian conformations
consisting of two or three strands. Analyzing large sets of data obtained for
$b=2,3$ and 4, we find that numbers $Z_N$ of Hamiltonian walks, on fractal
lattice with $N$ sites, for $N\gg 1$ behave as $Z_N\sim \omega^N
\mu^{N^\sigma}$. The leading term $\omega^N$ is characterized by the value of
the connectivity constant $\omega>1$, which depends on $b$, but not on the type
of HW. In contrast to that, the stretched exponential term $\mu^{N^\sigma}$
depends on the type of HW through constant $\mu<1$, whereas exponent $\sigma$
is determined by $b$ alone. For larger $b$ values, using some general features
of the applied recursive relations, without explicit enumeration of HWs, we
argue that asymptotical behavior of $Z_N$ should be the same, with $\sigma=\ln
3/\ln[b(b+1)(b+2)/6]$, valid for all $b>2$. This differs from the formulae
obtained recently for Hamiltonian walks on other fractal lattices, as well as
from the formula expected for homogeneous lattices. We discuss the possible

not produce signed entropy dissipation measures. To overcome these

establish the existence of measure-valued solutions of the isentropic Euler

establish that the entropy dissipation measures of the solutions of the

confined by the Tartar-Murat commutator relation. A careful characterization of
the unbounded support of the measure-valued solution confined by the commutator
relation yields the reduction of the measure-valued solution to a Delta mass,
which leads to the convergence of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to a
finite-energy entropy solution of the isentropic Euler equations.

accompanied by large transport events. This is particularly the case for the
high confinement regime of tokamaks where these events are termed edge
localized modes (ELMs). They result in the temporary breakdown of the high
confinement and lead to high power loads on plasma facing components. Present
theories of ELM generation rely on a combined effect of edge currents and the
edge pressure gradient exceeding critical values which result in intermediate
mode number ($n \cong 10-15$) structures (\emph{filaments}) localized in the
perpendicular plane and extended along the field line. It is shown here by
detailed localized measurements of the three components of the magnetic field
perturbation carried by an individual type I ELM filament that these filaments
carry a substantial current. The observations provide essential information for
the understanding of ELM dynamics.

to their omitting of inserting our experiment in the wider research stream of

not comply with the rules generally accepted for samples with small numbers.
However, apart from any possible theoretical speculation, there is the basic
fact that two different experiments (ours and that by Urutskoev et al.),
carried out independently and by different means, highlight an analogous
anomaly in the decay of thorium subjected to pressure waves. Such a convergence
of results shows that it is worth to further carry on experimental
investigations, in order to get either a confirmation or a disproof of the

  1. We show that if the noncommutative determinant polynomial has small

Consequently, the commutative permanent polynomial has small commutative
arithmetic circuits. 2. For any field F we show that computing the n X n
permanent over F is polynomial-time reducible to computing the 2n X 2n

the field F. 3. We also derive as a consequence that computing the n X n

the noncommutative determinant over Clifford algebras of n^{O(1)} dimension.

has been put forward thanks to numerical simulations of loops with footpoint
concentrated heating, a heating scenario in which cool condensations naturally
form in the corona. This effect has been termed 'catastrophic cooling' and is
the predominant explanation for coronal rain. In this work we further
investigate the link between this phenomenon and the heating mechanisms acting
in the corona. We start by analyzing observations of coronal rain at the limb
in the Ca II H line performed by the SOT instrument on board of the Hinode
satellite. We then compare the observations with 1.5-dimensional MHD
simulations of loops being heated by small-scale discrete events concentrated
towards the footpoints (that could come, for instance, from magnetic
reconnection events), and by Alfven waves generated at the photosphere. It is
found that if a loop is heated predominantly from Alfven waves coronal rain is
inhibited due to the characteristic uniform heating they produce. Hence coronal
rain may not only point to the spatial distribution of the heating in coronal
loops but also to the agent of the heating itself. We thus propose coronal rain
as a marker for coronal heating mechanisms.

well known $\Lambda$CDM model, statefinder diagnostic method is applied to this
bulk viscosity model, as a complementary to the $Om$ parameter diagnostic and
the deceleration parameter analysis performed by us before. The DE model
evolution behavior and tendency are shown in the plane of the statefinder
diagnostic parameter pair \{$r,s$\} where the fixed point represents the
$\Lambda$CDM model. The possible singularity property in this bulk viscosity
cosmology is also discussed to which we can conclude that in the different
parameter regions chosen properly, this concrete viscosity DE model can have
various late evolution behaviors and the late time singularity could be
avoided. We also calculate the cosmic entropy in the bulk viscosity dark energy
frame, and find that the total entropy in the viscosity DE model increases
monotonously with respect to the scale factor evolution, thus this monotonous
increasing property can indicate an arrow of time in the universe evolution,

square-root dependence on the defect concentration x=1/n^2. Tight-binding
calculations confirm these findings and show that the induced-gaps can be quite

theory calculations on a number of superlattices made by H atoms adsorbed on

that the proposed structures may be used in practice to open a gap in graphene.

(Schelling 1971; Schelling 1978) reflects the most abstract view of the
non-economic forces of residential migrations: be close to people of 'your
own'. The model assumes that the residential agent, located in the neighborhood
where the fraction of 'friends' is less than a predefined threshold value F,
tries to relocate to a neighborhood for which this fraction is above F. It is
well known that for the equal groups, depending on F, Schelling's residential
pattern converges either to complete integration (random pattern) or
segregation. We investigate Schelling model pattern dynamics as dependent on F,
the ratio of the group numbers and the size of the neighborhood and demonstrate
that the traditional integrate-segregate dichotomy is incomplete. In case of
unequal groups, there exists the wide interval of the F-values that entails the
third persistent residential pattern, in which part of the majority population
segregates, while the rest remains integrated with the minority. We also
demonstrate that Schelling model dynamics essentially depends on the
description of agents' residential behavior. To obtain sociologically
meaningful results, the agents should be satisficers, and the fraction of the
agents who relocate irrespective of the neighborhood state should be non-zero.

a number of weak lensing techniques that could be used to detect filaments in
individual or stacked cluster fields, and apply them to synthetic lensing data
sets in the fields of clusters from the Millennium Simulation. These techniques
are multipole moments of the shear and convergence, mass reconstruction, and
parameterized fits to filament mass profiles using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
approach. In particular, two new filament detection techniques are explored
(multipole shear filters and Markov Chain Monte Carlo mass profile fits), and
we outline the quality of data required to be able to identify and quantify
filament profiles. We also consider the effects of large scale structure on
filament detection. We conclude that using these techniques, there will be
realistic prospects of detecting filaments in data from future space-based
missions. The methods presented in this paper will be of great use in the
identification of dark matter filaments in future surveys.

apparent in the data of all the sources at energies 6-7 keV. The drop is
interpreted here in terms of relativistically-blurred ionized reflection from
the accretion disk. A soft-excess is also detected from these sources (as
usually found in the spectra of AGN), with emission from O K and Fe L, in the
case of NGC 5408 X-1 and Holmberg II X-1, which can be understood as features
arising from reflection of the disk. Remarkably, ionized disk reflection and
the associated powerlaw continuum provide a good description of the broad-band
spectrum, including the soft-excess. There is no requirement for thermal
emission from the inner disk in the description of the spectra. The black holes
of these systems must then be highly spinning, with a spin close to the maximum
rate of a maximal spinning black hole. The results require the action of strong
light bending in these sources. We suggest that they could be strongly
accreting black holes in which most of the energy is extracted from the flow
magnetically and released above the disc thereby avoiding the conventional
Eddington limit.

inhomogeneities and averaged over all directions from a given observer. The
inhomogeneities are modeled as mass-compensated voids in random or regular
lattices within Swiss-cheese universes. Void radii below 300 Mpc are
considered, which are supported by current redshift surveys and limited by the
recently observed imprint such voids leave on CMB. The averaging over all
directions, performed by numerical ray tracing, is non-perturbative and
includes the supernovas inside the voids. Voids aligning along a certain
direction produce a cumulative gravitational lensing correction that increases
with their number. Such corrections are destroyed by the averaging over all
directions, even in non-randomized simple cubic void lattices. At low
redshifts, the average correction is not zero but decays with the peculiar
velocities and redshift. Its upper bound is provided by the maximal average
correction which assumes no random cancelations between different voids. It is
described well by a linear perturbation formula and, for the voids considered,
is 20% of the correction corresponding to the maximal peculiar velocity. The
average correction calculated in random and simple cubic void lattices is
severely damped below the predicted maximal one after a single void diameter.
That is traced to cancellations between the corrections from the fronts and
backs of different voids. All that implies that voids cannot imitate the effect
of dark energy unless they have radii and peculiar velocities much larger than
the currently observed. The results obtained allow one to readily predict the
redshift above which the direction-averaged fluctuation in the Hubble diagram
falls below a required precision and suggest a method to extract the background
Hubble constant from low redshift data without the need to correct for peculiar
velocities.
