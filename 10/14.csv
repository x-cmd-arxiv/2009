particularly optically faint (24/R>1000). By combining N-body/SPH simulations
of high redshift galaxy evolution with 3D polychromatic dust radiative transfer
models, we find that luminous DOGs (with F24 > 0.3 mJy at z~2 are well-modeled
as extreme gas-rich mergers in massive (~5x10^12-10^13 Msun) halos, with
elevated star formation rates (~500-1000 Msun/yr) and/or significant AGN growth
(Mdot > 0.5 Msun/yr), whereas less luminous DOGs are more diverse in nature. At
final coalescence, merger-driven DOGs transition from being starburst dominated
to AGN dominated, evolving from a ""bump"" to a power-law shaped mid-IR (IRAC)
spectral energy distribution (SED). After the DOG phase, the galaxy settles
back to exhibiting a ""bump"" SED with bluer colors and lower star formation
rates. While canonically power-law galaxies are associated with being
AGN-dominated, we find that the power-law mid-IR SED can owe both to direct AGN
contribution, as well as to a heavily dust obscured stellar bump at times that
the galaxy is starburst dominated. Thus power-law galaxies can be either
starburst or AGN dominated. Less luminous DOGs can be well-represented either
by mergers, or by massive ($M_{\rm baryon} ~5x10^11 Msun) secularly evolving
gas-rich disc galaxies (with SFR > 50 Msun/yr). By utilising similar models as
those employed in the SMG formation study of Narayanan et al. (2010), we
investigate the connection between DOGs and SMGs. We find that the most heavily
star-forming merger driven DOGs can be selected as Submillimetre Galaxies
(SMGs), while both merger-driven and secularly evolving DOGs typically satisfy
the BzK selection criteria.

In such theories interactions are basically governed by a gauge principle and

that CP violation is achieved as the result of compactification of extra
dimensions, which is incompatible with the 4-dimensional CP transformation. As
a simple example we adopt a 6-dimensional U(1) model compactified on a
2-dimensional orbifold $T^{2}/Z_{4}$. We argue that the 4-dimensional CP
transformation is related to the complex structure of the extra space and show
how the $Z_{4}$ orbifolding leads to CP violation. We confirm by explicit
calculation of the interaction vertices that CP violating phases remain even
after the re-phasing of relevant fields. For completeness, we derive a
re-phasing invariant CP violating quantity, following a similar argument in the
Kobayashi-Maskawa model which led to the Jarlskog parameter. As an example of a

attempts to present information items (movies, music, books, news, images, Web

collaborative systems deal with situations with two types of variables, users

wide-ranging literature, little is known about the statistical properties of

method, which is one of the most widely used algorithms in collaborative
filtering. We establish consistency of the procedure under mild assumptions on
the model. Rates of convergence and examples are also provided.

conventional description of the process leads to results at a substantial
variation with experiment. To improve the results, the present calculation is
done in a reference frame (the ANB or Active Nucleon Breit frame) which
diminishes the influence of relativistic effects on nuclear states. The
laboratory frame response function is then obtained via a kinematics
transformation. In addition, a one-body nuclear current operator is employed
that includes all leading order relativistic corrections. Multipoles of this
operator are listed. It is shown that the use of the ANB frame leads to a
sizable shift of the quasi-elastic peak to lower energy and, contrary to the
relativistic current, also to an increase of the peak height. The additionally
considered meson exchange current contribution is quite small in the peak
region. In comparison with experiment one finds an excellent agreement of the
peak positions. The peak height agrees well with experiment for the lowest
considered momentum transfer (500 MeV/c), but tends to be too high for higher

  We find that >25% of ellipticals contain HI at the level of M(HI)>10^8
M(Sun), and that M(HI) is of the order of a few percent of the total stellar
mass. Available data are insufficient to establish whether galaxies with a
disturbed stellar morphology are more likely to contain HI. However, HI
interferometry reveals very disturbed gas morphology/kinematics in all but one
of the detected systems, confirming the continuing assembly of many ellipticals
but also showing that this is not necessarily gas-free. We also find that all
very disturbed ellipticals have a single-stellar-population-equivalent age <4
Gyr. We interpret this as evidence that ~0.5-5% of their stellar mass is
contained in a young population formed during the past ~1 Gyr. Overall, a large
fraction of ellipticals seem to have continued their assembly over the past few
Gyr in the presence of a mass of cold gas of the order of 10% of the galaxy
stellar mass. This material is now observable as neutral hydrogen and young

the boundary of the bulk insulator is a realization of the much sought exotic
""topological metal"". They also suggest that this material has potential
application in developing next-generation quantum computing devices that may
incorporate ""light-like"" bulk carriers and topologically protected

non-topological operations which heavily depend on the experimental realization

can be relaxed by using composite anyons: starting from an unknown state with
reasonable physical properties, it is possible to efficiently distill suitable
initial states for computation purely by braiding. This is achieved by encoding
logical information in a subsystem code with gauge system corresponding to the

one source are detected in all four IRAC bands, 3.6 to 8 microns. We use a new

colocalized along their Xic (X-Inactivation Center) regions. The mechanism
inducing recognition and pairing of the X's remains, though, elusive. Starting
from recent discoveries on the molecular factors and on the DNA sequences (the
so-called ``pairing sites'') involved, we dissect the mechanical basis of Xic
colocalization by using a Statistical Physics model. We show that soluble DNA
specific binding molecules, as those experimentally identified, can be indeed
sufficient to induce the spontaneous colocalization of the homologous
chromosomes, but only when their concentration, or chemical affinity, rises
above a threshold value, as a consequence of a thermodynamic phase transition.
We derive the likelihood of pairing and its probability distribution.
Chromosome dynamics has two stages: an initial independent Brownian diffusion
followed, after a characteristic time scale, by recognition and pairing.
Finally, we investigate the effects of DNA deletion/insertions in the region of
pairing sites and compare model predictions to available experimental data.

different time series $X_{t}$. The branching ratio $b_x$ is defined as $b_x=
E[\xi_x/x]$. The random variable $\xi_x$ is the value of the next signal given
that the previous one is equal to $x$, so $\xi_x=\{X_{t+1}|X_t=x\}$. If
$b_x>1$, the process is on average supercritical when the signal is equal to
$x$, while if $b_x<1$, it is subcritical. For stock prices we find $b_x=1$
within statistical uncertainty, for all $x$, consistent with an ``efficient
market hypothesis''. For stock volumes, solar X-ray flux intensities, and the
Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model, $b_x$ is supercritical for small
values of activity and subcritical for the largest ones, indicating a tendency
to return to a typical value. For stock volumes this tendency has an
approximate power law behavior. For solar X-ray flux and the BTW model, there
is a broad regime of activity where $b_x \simeq 1$, which we interpret as an
indicator of critical behavior. This is true despite different underlying
probability distributions for $X_t$, and for $\xi_x$. For the BTW model the
distribution of $\xi_x$ is Gaussian, for $x$ sufficiently larger than one, and
its variance grows linearly with $x$. Hence, the activity in the BTW model
obeys a central limit theorem when sampling over past histories. The broad
region of activity where $b_x$ is close to one disappears once bulk dissipation
is introduced in the BTW model -- supporting our hypothesis that it is an
indicator of criticality.

often longer than the duration of the softer emission detected by the Gamma
Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi [this confirms earlier results from the
Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET)]; (ii) its spectrum is
consistent with F(v) propto v^(-1) and does not show strong spectral evolution;
(iii) for the brightest bursts, the flux detected by the LAT decays as a power
law with a typical slope: t^(-1.5). We argue that the observed >0.1 GeV flux
can be interpreted as afterglow emission shortly following the start of the
prompt phase emission as seen at smaller frequencies. The decay slope is what
expected if the fireball emission is produced in the radiative regime, i.e. all
dissipated energy is radiated away. We also argue that the detectability in the
GeV energy range depends on the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the bursts, being
strongly favoured in the case of large Gamma. This implies that the fraction of
bursts detected at high energies corresponds to the fraction of bursts having
the largest Gamma. The radiative interpretation can help to explain why the
observed X-ray and optical afterglow energetics are much smaller than the
energetics emitted during the prompt phase, despite the fact that the collision
with the external medium should be more efficient than internal shocks in
producing the radiation we see.

ion-PAH and electron-PAH nuclear and electronic interactions, above the
threshold for carbon atom loss from a PAH, in 50-200 km/s shock waves in the
warm intercloud medium. Results: Interstellar PAHs (Nc = 50) do not survive in
shocks with velocities greater than 100 km/s and larger PAHs (Nc = 200) are
destroyed for shocks with velocities greater/equal to 125 km/s. For shocks in
the ~75 - 100 km/s range, where destruction is not complete, the PAH structure
is likely to be severely denatured by the loss of an important fraction
(20-40%) of the carbon atoms. We derive typical PAH lifetimes of the order of a
few x10^8 yr for the Galaxy. These results are robust and independent of the
uncertainties in some key parameters that have yet to be well-determined
experimentally. Conclusions: The observation of PAH emission in shock regions
implies that that emission either arises outside the shocked region or that
those regions entrain denser clumps that, unless they are completely ablated
and eroded in the shocked gas, allow dust and PAHs to survive in extreme
environments.

positions from Spitzer and/or radio counterparts, we find 16 objects (45+/-8%)
with significant X-ray detections in the 2Ms Chandra data. 6 of these SMGs
(~17+/-6%) have measured X-ray luminosities or upper limits consistent with
those expected based on the far-infrared (FIR) or radio-derived star formation
rate (SFR), and hence with the X-rays coming solely from star formation. In
another 7 sources (20+/-7%) a dominant AGN contribution to the X-ray emission
is required, while in 3 more it is unclear whether stellar process or accretion
are responsible. Stacking of the X-ray undetected SMGs reveals a highly
significant detection. If due to star formation, this corresponds to an average
X-ray derived SFR of ~150 Msun/yr. We deduce that the AGN fraction in SMGs
based on X-ray observations is 20-29 (+/-7) %, which is towards the lower limit
of previous estimates. Spectral analysis shows that in general the SMGs are not
heavily obscured in the X-ray but most of the SMGs classfied as AGN show
absorption with N_H in excess of 10^22 cm^-2. Of the secure AGN, the bolometric
luminosity appears to be dominated by the AGN in only 3 cases. In ~85% of the
SMGs, the X-ray spectrum effectively rules out an AGN contribution that
dominates the bolometric emission, even if the AGN is Compton thick. The
evidence therefore suggests that intense star formation accounts for both the
FIR and X-ray emission in most SMGs. We argue that, rather than having an
especially high AGN fraction or duty cycle, SMGs have a high X-ray detection
rate at very faint fluxes partly because of their high star formation rates
and, in rarer cases, because the submm emission is from an AGN.(abridged)

systematic ones. The diffuse X-rays were attributed to be inverse Compton
radiation by the synchrotron radio electrons scattering off the cosmic
microwave background photons. This radio galaxy is the largest among those with
lobes detected through inverse Compton X-ray emission. A comparison of the
radio to X-ray fluxes yields the energy densities of electron and magnetic
field as $u_e = (2.3 \pm 0.3 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-13}$ ergs/cm3 and $u_m =
(1.2_{-0.1}^{+0.2}\pm 0.2) \times 10^{-14}$ ergs/cm3, respectively. The galaxy
is suggested to host a low luminosity nucleus with an absorption-corrected 2 --
10 keV luminosity of $<2 \times 10^{42}$ ergs/s, together with a relatively
weak radio core. The energetics in the west lobe of 3C 326 were compared with
those of moderate radio galaxies with a size of $\sim 100$ kpc. The west lobe
of 3C 326 is confirmed to agree with the correlations for the moderate radio
galaxies, $u_e \propto D^{-2.2\pm0.4}$ and $u_m \propto D^{-2.4\pm0.4}$, where
$D$ is their total physical size. This implies that the lobes of 3C 326 are
still being energized by the jet, despite the current weakness of the nucleus.

4636, using Chandra data. We have compared the X-ray mass density profile with
that derived from a dynamical analysis of the system's globular clusters (GCs).
Given the observed interaction between the central active galactic nucleus and
the X-ray emitting gas in NGC 4636, we would expect to see a discrepancy in the
masses recovered by the two methods. Such a discrepancy exists within the
central ~10kpc, which we interpret as the result of non-thermal pressure
support or a local inflow. However, over the radial range ~10-30kpc, the mass
profiles agree within the 1-sigma errors, indicating that even in this highly
disturbed system, agreement can be sought at an acceptable level of
significance over intermediate radii, with both methods also indicating the
need for a dark matter halo. However, at radii larger than 30kpc, the X-ray
mass exceeds the dynamical mass, by a factor of 4-5 at the largest
disagreement. A Fully Bayesian Significance Test finds no statistical reason to
reject our assumption of velocity isotropy, and an analysis of X-ray mass
profiles in different directions from the galaxy centre suggests that local
disturbances at large radius are not the cause of the discrepancy. We instead
attribute the discrepancy to the paucity of GC kinematics at large radius,
coupled with not knowing the overall state of the gas at the radius where we
are reaching the group regime (>30kpc), or a combination of the two.

of quantitative sociology by means of statistical mechanics. After a short
pedagogical introduction to static and dynamic properties of many body systems,
we develop a theory for agents interactions on random graph.
  Our approach is based on describing a social network as a graph whose nodes
represent agents and links between two of them stand for a reciprocal
interaction. Each agent has to choose among a dichotomic option (i.e. agree or
disagree) with respect to a given matter and he is driven by external
influences (as media) and peer to peer interactions. These mimic the imitative
behavior of the collectivity and may possibly be zero if the two nodes are
disconnected. For this scenario we work out both the dynamics and the
corresponding equilibria (statics). Once the 2-body theory is completely
explored, we analyze, on the same random graph, a ""diffusive strategic
dynamics"" with pairwise interactions, where detailed balance constraint is
relaxed. The dynamic encodes some relevant processes which are expected to play
a crucial role in the approach to equilibrium in social systems, i.e. diffusion
of information and strategic choices. We observe numerically that such a
dynamics reaches a well defined steady state that fulfills a ""shift property"":
the critical interaction strength for the phase transition is lower with
respect to the one expected from canonical equilibrium.
  Finally, we show how the stationary states obtained with this dynamics can be
described by statistical mechanics equilibria of a diluted p-spin model, for a
suitable non-integer real p>2. Several implications from a sociological
perspective are discussed together with some general outlooks.

Gegenbauer polynomial.The model has a hyperbolic power law behavior, a feature
linked to the golden mean ratio of two adjacent Fibonacci numbers and also the
connection of Lucas numbers to the golden mean. The relation to other power law
behavior, such as Zipf and Pareto laws, is mentioned. For the cases considered,
the grand canonical ensemble involves the Gauss hypergeometric function
F(a,b,c,z) with specific values for a,b,c. The general case has a variable
power law behavior with tau exponent equal to1+c-a-b. An application with
a=1/2, b=1, c=3 and thus tau=5/2 very closely approximates Bose-Einstein
condensation. The zeta function zeta(3/2)=2.61 of the exact theory is replaced
with 8/3 and zeta(5/2)= 1.34 with 4/3. At the condensation point the number of
cycles of length falls as a scale invariant power law. The cycles, which arise
from permutation symmetries associated with Bose-Einstein statistics, can be
viewed as links in a complex network of connections between particles. This
scale invariant power law parallels that seen in complex networks. The growth
of the network is developed using recurrence properties of the model.
Constraints imposed by the canonical ensemble and associates correlations lead
to some number theoretic connections between Fibonacci and Lucas numbers as an
incidental consequence of this approach.

domain name resolution. Each DNS query generated by a user reveals -- to one or
more DNS servers -- the origin and target of that query. Over time, a user's
browsing behavior might be exposed to entities with little or no trust. Current
DNS privacy leaks stem from fundamental DNS features and are not easily fixable
by simple patches. Moreover, privacy issues have been overlooked by DNS
security efforts (i.e. DNSSEC) and are thus likely to propagate into future
versions of DNS.
  In order to mitigate privacy issues in current DNS, this paper proposes a
Privacy-Preserving Domain Name System (PPDNS), which maintains privacy during
domain name resolution. PPDNS is based on distributed hash tables (DHTs), an
alternative naming infrastructure, and computational private information
retrieval (cPIR), an advanced cryptographic construct. PPDNS takes advantage of
the DHT's index structure to improve name resolution query privacy, while
leveraging cPIR to reduce communication overhead for bandwidth-sensitive
clients. Our analysis shows that PPDNS is a viable approach for obtaining a
higher degree of privacy for name resolution queries. PPDNS also serves as a
demonstration of blending advanced systems techniques with their cryptographic
counterparts.

  integration into ordinary functional integration","Prespace.J.1:1249-1266,2010",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feynman's Lagrangian path integral was an outgrowth of Dirac's vague surmise
that Lagrangians have a role in quantum mechanics. Lagrangians implicitly
incorporate Hamilton's first equation of motion, so their use contravenes the
uncertainty principle, but they are relevant to semiclassical approximations
and relatedly to the ubiquitous case that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in the
canonical momenta, which accounts for the Lagrangian path integral's ""success"".
Feynman also invented the Hamiltonian phase-space path integral, which is fully
compatible with the uncertainty principle. We recast this as an ordinary
functional integral by changing direct integration over subpaths constrained to
all have the same two endpoints into an equivalent integration over those
subpaths' unconstrained second derivatives. Function expansion with generalized
Legendre polynomials of time then enables the functional integral to be
unambiguously evaluated through first order in the elapsed time, yielding the
Schroedinger equation with a unique quantization of the classical Hamiltonian.
Widespread disbelief in that uniqueness stemmed from the mistaken notion that
no subpath can have its two endpoints arbitrarily far separated when its
nonzero elapsed time is made arbitrarily short. We also obtain the quantum
amplitude for any specified configuration or momentum path, which turns out to
be an ordinary functional integral over, respectively, all momentum or all
configuration paths. The first of these results is directly compared with
Feynman's mistaken Lagrangian-action hypothesis for such a configuration path
amplitude, with special heed to the case that the Hamiltonian is quadratic in
the canonical momenta.

(assumed to be a constant at z>1 or z>1.5). Without flux-averaging of SNe Ia,
the combined data using the ``Constitution'' set of SNe Ia seem to indicate a
deviation from a cosmological constant at ~95% confidence level at 0< z <0.8;
they are consistent with a cosmological constant at ~68% confidence level when
SNe Ia are flux-averaged. The combined data using the nearby +SDSS +ESSENCE

68% confidence level with or without flux-averaging of SNe Ia, and give dark

conform with the Boltzmann factor distribution of the forcefield describing the
full molecule. In this way, high-quality equilibrium sampling of small peptides
(4-8 residues) typically requires less than one hour of single-processor
wallclock time and can be significantly faster than Langevin simulations.
Furthermore, approximate but clash-free ensembles can be generated for larger
peptides (e.g., 16 residues) in less than a minute of single-processor
computing. We also describe an application to free energy calculation, a
""multi-resolution"" implementation of the growth procedure and application to
fragment assembly protein-structure prediction protocols.

cube $C$ in $R^n$ and satisfy the constraints $\sum_j h_{ij}(x_j )=s_i ,1\le
i\le d$ is approximated by an Edgeworth-corrected Gaussian formula based on the
maximum entropy density $p$ on $x \in C$, that satisfies $E\sum_j h_{ij}(x_j
)=s_i ,1\le i\le d$. Under $p$, the variables $X_1 ,X_2 ,...X_n $ are
independent with densities of exponential form. Letting $S_i$ denote the random
variable $\sum_j h_{ij}(X_j )$, conditional on $S=s, X$ is uniformly
distributed over the integers in $C$ that satisfy $S=s$. The number of points
in $C$ satisfying $S=s$ is $p \{S=s\}\exp (I(p))$ where $I(p)$ is the entropy
of the density $p$. We estimate $p \{S=s\}$ by $p_Z(s)$, the density at $s$ of
the multivariate Gaussian $Z$ with the same first two moments as $S$; and when
$d$ is large we use in addition an Edgeworth factor that requires the first
four moments of $S$ under $p$. The asymptotic validity of the
Edgeworth-corrected estimate is proved and demonstrated for counting
contingency tables with given row and column sums as the number of rows and
columns approaches infinity, and demonstrated for counting the number of graphs
with a given degree sequence, as the number of vertices approaches infinity.

relativistic covariance can peacefully coexist if the ordinary spacetime (OST)

process, where PST is a spacetime generalization of a notion of phase space
(this is a 7-dimensional version of the 8-dimensional structure proposed by
Caianiello). Furthermore, Caianiello's idea of finite acceleration is
implemented. After this is done, the paper then goes on to generalize the
geometric notions obtained from the intuition of PST to a general discrete
causal set, without any geometric background. It then takes advantage of the
absence of lightcone singularity to attempt to tackle the definition of
PST-like causal set; that is, a discrete system that approximates the
geometrical properties that we would expect from continuum PST. Finally, the
paper proceeds to introduce quantum field theory on a causal set, and shows
that the locality gained by switching from OST to PST brings us one step closer
to be able to treat quantum field theory on a causal set analytically rather
than numerically.

then demonstrate its applications in an interference channel with a

can outperform Gaussian codes for this channel when the achieved rate is
measured with the weak secrecy notion. Here, with the Renyi entropy and the min
entropy measure, we prove that the same secure degree of freedom is achievable
with the strong secrecy notion as well. A major benefit of the new coding
scheme is that the strong secrecy is generated from a single lattice point
instead of a sequence of lattice points. Hence the mutual information between
the confidential message and the observation of the eavesdropper decreases much
faster with the number of channel uses than previously known strong secrecy
coding methods for nested lattice codes.

are in thermal equilibrium, the entropy-area law holds inevitably. However no
rigorous verification is given to such a very strong universality of the law in
multi-horizon spacetimes. Then, based on thermodynamically consistent and
rigorous discussion, this paper suggests an evidence of breakdown of
entropy-area law for horizons in Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, in which
the temperatures of the horizons are different. The outline is as follows: We
construct carefully ""two thermal equilibrium systems"" individually for black
hole event horizon (BEH) and cosmological event horizon (CEH), for which the
Euclidean action method is applicable. The integration constant (subtraction
term) in Euclidean action is determined with referring to Schwarzschild and de
Sitter canonical ensembles. The free energies of the two thermal systems are
functions of three independent state variables, and we find a similarity of our
two thermal systems with the magnetized gas in laboratory, which gives us a
physical understanding of the necessity of three independent state variables.
Then, via the thermodynamic consistency with three independent state variables,
the breakdown of entropy-area law for CEH is suggested. The validity of the law
for BEH can not be judged, but we clarify the key issue for BEH's entropy.
Finally we make comments which may suggest the breakdown of entropy-area law
for BEH, and also propose two discussions; one of them is on the quantum
statistics of underlying quantum gravity, and another is on the SdS black hole
evaporation from the point of view of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

distinguishing properties of the material are the charge carriers
two-dimensional and relativistic character. The first experimental evidence of
the two-dimensional nature of graphene came from the observation of a sequence
of plateaus in measurements of its transport properties in the presence of an
applied magnetic field. These are signatures of the so-called integer quantum
Hall effect. However, as a consequence of the relativistic character of the
charge carriers, the integer quantum Hall effect observed in graphene is
qualitatively different from its semiconductor analogue. As a third
distinguishing feature of graphene, it has been conjectured that interactions
and correlations should be important in this material, but surprisingly,
evidence of collective behaviour in graphene is lacking. In particular, the
quintessential collective quantum behaviour in two dimensions, the fractional
quantum Hall effect (FQHE), has so far resisted observation in graphene despite
intense efforts and theoretical predictions of its existence. Here we report
the observation of the FQHE in graphene. Our observations are made possible by

measurements. This allows us to isolate the sample from substrate-induced
perturbations that usually obscure the effects of interactions in this system

its observation only in the highest quality samples. We believe that these

binary evolution leads to the formation of many peculiar stars, including blue
stragglers and hot subdwarfs. We will discuss binary evolution and the
formation of blue stragglers and hot subdwarfs, and show that those hot objects

conclude that binary interactions should be included in the study of EPS.
Indeed, binary interactions make a stellar population younger (hotter), and the
far-ultraviolet (UV) excess in elliptical galaxies is shown to be most likely
resulted from binary interactions. This has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the far-UV excess and elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the far-UV excess is not a sign of age,
as had been postulated prviously and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from

due to the effects of Zeeman splitting. Finally, an expression for the

various types of mergers, i.e. gas-rich (wet), gas-poor (dry), or mixed
mergers, affect the merger products in different ways. The epoch when each type
of merger dominates also differs. In this talk, I review the recent progress on
the measurements of galaxy merger rates out to z ~ 3 and the level of
interaction-triggered star formation using large samples from various redshift
surveys. These results provide insights to the importance of mergers in the
mass assembly history of galaxies and in the evolution of galaxy properties. I
also present new results in characterizing the environment of galaxy mergers,
and discuss their implications in the built up of red-sequence galaxies.

the underlying Hamiltonian in one of less usual, {\em ad hoc} representations
${\cal H}_j$ of the Hilbert space of states in which the inner product is local
(at $j=0$) or increasingly nonlocal (at $j=1,2, ...$). Explicit examples of

of the current proposal to solve this puzzle is the existence of a large

large $C/T$, the ratio of the color-suppressed to the color-allowed tree

amplitude an additional color-suppressed term to generate a large $C/T$ and a
large strong phase for $C$ and an additional penguin-like contribution, we
obtain branching ratios for all $B\to K\pi$ modes and CP asymmetry for ${\bar

data ""with a two dimensional organization"". The algorithm is designed to be
implemented with FPGAs or custom electronics. The key feature is a processing
time that scales linearly with the amount of data to be processed. This means
that clustering can be performed in pipeline with the readout, without
suffering from combinatorial delays due to looping multiple times through all
the data. This feature makes this algorithm especially well suited for problems
where the data has high density, e.g. in the case of tracking devices working
under high-luminosity condition such as those of LHC or Super-LHC. The
algorithm is organized in two steps: the first step (core) clusters the data;
the second step analyzes each cluster of data to extract the desired
information. The current algorithm is developed as a clustering device for
modern high-energy physics pixel detectors. However, the algorithm has much
broader field of applications. In fact, its core does not specifically rely on
the kind of data or detector it is working for, while the second step can and
should be tailored for a given application. Applications can thus be foreseen
to other detectors and other scientific fields ranging from HEP calorimeters to
medical imaging. An additional advantage of this two steps approach is that the
typical clustering related calculations (second step) are separated from the
combinatorial complications of clustering. This separation simplifies the
design of the second step and it enables it to perform sophisticated
calculations achieving online-quality in online applications. The algorithm is
general purpose in the sense that only minimal assumptions on the kind of
clustering to be performed are made.

evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery
of future adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate
relationship between robustness and complexity in biology.
  This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the
origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the
hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of
multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and
robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence
that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to

to decompose a schedule into its components (i.e. the allocated shift pattern
of each nurse), and then to implement two evolutionary elimination strategies
mimicking natural selection and natural mutation process on these components
respectively to iteratively deliver better schedules. The worthiness of all
components in the schedule has to be continuously demonstrated in order for
them to remain there. This demonstration employs an evaluation function which
evaluates how well each component contributes towards the final objective. Two
elimination steps are then applied: the first elimination eliminates a number
of components that are deemed not worthy to stay in the current schedule; the
second elimination may also throw out, with a low level of probability, some
worthy components. The eliminated components are replenished with new ones
using a set of constructive heuristics using local optimality criteria.
Computational results using 52 data instances demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed approach in solving real-world problems.

fast and strong variability, such as OJ 287, PKS 1749+096 and BL Lac, but also
sources with more rolling fluctuations like PKS 0735+178. The most extreme
flares can last for up to 13 years or have peak fluxes of approximately 12 Jy
in the observer's frame. When the Doppler boosting effect is taken into
account, the peak flux of a flare does not depend on the duration of the flare.
A rough analysis of the time lags and peak flux evolution indicates that BLO
flares in the mm - cm wavelengths are high-peaking, i.e., are in the adiabatic
stage. Thus, the results concur with the generalized shock model.

where the magnetic field is generated by the interplay between differential
rotation (the Omega effect) and a mean electromotive force due to helical
turbulent convection flows (the alpha effect). There are, however, turbulent
dynamo mechnisms that may complement the alpha effect or may be an alternative
to it. Aims: We investigate models of solar-type dynamos where the alpha effect
is completely replaced by two other turbulent dynamo mechanisms, namely the
Omega x J effect and the shear-current effect, which both result from an
inhomogeneity of the mean magnetic field. Methods: We studied axisymmetric
mean-field dynamo models containing differential rotation, the Omega x J and
shear-current effects, and a meridional circulation. The model calculations
were carried out using the rotation profile of the Sun as obtained from
helioseismic measurements and radial profiles of other quantities according to
a standard model of the solar interior. Results: Without meridional flow, no
satisfactory agreement of the models with the solar observations can be
obtained. With a sufficiently strong meridional circulation included, however,
the main properties of the large-scale solar magnetic field, namely, its
oscillatory behavior, its latitudinal drift towards the equator within each
half cycle, and its dipolar parity with respect to the equatorial plane, are
correctly reproduced. Conclusions: We have thereby constructed the first
mean-field models of solar-type dynamos that do not use the alpha effect.

changes strongly among different observations of the same source (from ~1

maximum likelihood Point Spread Function fitting algorithm to evaluate the

transduction emerges, e.g., by random variation in syntheses, evolution prompts

Knowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated IT

two apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, the
task-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developing
the design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of an
information usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model is
extended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate them
in form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm,
a set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a design
method, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, the
Knowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order to
meet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform for
building and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work Support

supported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticated

large particles have slower motion than the small particles, and act as
confining ""walls"" which slow the motion of nearby small particles. The
rearrangement of these confining structures governs the lifetime of dynamical

well as pseudoscalar densitites for the cases in which some or all of them lay
in the epsilon-regime. As expected, finite volume dependence turns out to be
significant in this regime and can be predicted in the effective theory in
terms of the infinite-volume low-energy couplings. These results might be
relevant for extraction of heavy-light meson properties from lattice

Hamiltonian dynamics rule the transport properties of these impurities.
Therefore a technique to reduce chaotic diffusion in Hamiltonian systems is
able to address the issue of reducing the radial transport of impurities under
some approximations. The general idea is to build barriers in phase space by a
small and apt modification of the Hamiltonian. We show numerically that such

  Ottewill",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The basis of this work is the first full application of the
Poisson-Wiseman-Anderson method of `matched expansions' to compute the
self-force acting on a point particle moving in a curved spacetime. The method
employs two expansions for the Green function which are respectively valid in
the `quasilocal' and `distant past' regimes, and which are matched together
within the normal neighborhood.
  Building on a fundamental insight due to Avramidi, we provide a system of
transport equations for determining key fundamental bi-tensors, including the
tail-term, V(x,x'), appearing in the Hadamard form of the Green function. These
bitensors are central to a broad range of problems from radiation reaction and
the self-force to quantum field theory in curved spacetime and quantum gravity.
Using their transport equations, we show how the quasilocal Green function may
be computed throughout the normal neighborhood both numerically and as a
covariant Taylor series expansion. These calculations are carried out for
several black hole spacetimes.
  Finally, we present a complete application of the method of matched
expansions. The calculation is performed in a static region of the spherically
symmetric Nariai spacetime (dS_2 X S^2), where the matched expansion method is
applied to compute the scalar self-force acting on a static particle. We find
that the matched expansion method provides insight into the non-local
properties of the self-force. The Green function in Schwarzschild spacetime is
expected to share certain key features with Nariai. In this way, the Nariai
spacetime provides a fertile testing ground for developing insight into the
non-local part of the self-force on black hole spacetimes.

resembles that of a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and extends asymmetrically to the

probably connected and lie between 8 kpc and 13 kpc. The resulting age of the
system is between 10 and 30 kyr. For a 10 kpc distance (also consistent with

  Galaxy Environment","PhD dissertation, deposited 27 July 2009",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore how the local environment is related to properties of active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) of various luminosities. Recent simulations and
observations are converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars,
the brightest of AGNs, is fueled in major mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such
a picture, quasars, the highest luminosity AGNs, are expected to be located in
regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where mergers are
more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity observed in
low-luminosity AGNs is due to secular processes that are less dependent on the
local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the local photometric
galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic type I and type II
quasars to the local density around lower-luminosity spectroscopic type I and
type II AGNs. To minimize projection effects and evolution in the photometric
galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN environments, we place our random
control sample at the same redshift as our AGNs and impose a narrow redshift
window around both the AGNs and control targets. Our results support these
merger models for bright AGN origins. We find that the brightest sources have
overdensities that increase on the smallest scales compared to dimmer sources.
In addition, we investigate the nature of the quasar and AGN environments
themselves and find that the increased overdensity of early-type galaxies in
the environments of bright type I sources suggests that they are located in
richer cluster environments than dim sources. We measure increased environment
overdensity with increased quasar black hole mass, consistent with the
well-known M_{DMH}-M_{BH} relationship, and find evidence for quenching in the
environments of high accretion efficiency type I quasars.
