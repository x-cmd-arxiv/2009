Science WFC3/IR data over the CDF-South GOODS field to quantify the broadband
spectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. We determine the
UV-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies
at later times to measure the evolution in beta. For luminous L*(z=3) galaxies,
we measure a mean UV-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable to
the beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. However, for the lower
luminosity 0.1L*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. This is
substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just
800 Myr later, and even at z~5-6. In principle, the observed beta of -3.0 can
be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular
emission is included the expected beta becomes >~-2.7. To produce these very
blue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to
reduce the red nebular emission are likely required. For example, a large
escape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}>~0.3) could minimize the contribution from this
red nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7
galaxies is >~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.

LSST, will locate thousands to millions of type Ia supernova candidates per
year, a rate prohibitive for acquiring spectroscopy to determine each
candidate's type and redshift. In response, we have developed an economical
approach to identifying SNe Ia and their redshifts using an uncommon type of
optical filter which has multiple, discontinuous passbands on a single
substrate. Observation of a supernova through a specially designed pair of
these `cross-correlation filters' measures the approximate amplitude and phase
of the cross-correlation between the spectrum and a SN Ia template, a quantity
typically used to determine the redshift and type of a high-redshift SN Ia.
Simulating the use of these filters, we obtain a sample of SNe Ia which is ~98%
pure with individual redshifts measured to 0.01 precision. The advantages of
this approach over standard broadband photometric methods are that it is
insensitive to reddening, independent of the color data used for subsequent
distance determinations which reduces selection or interpretation bias, and
because it makes use of the spectral features its reliability is greater. A
great advantage over long-slit spectroscopy comes from increased throughput,
enhanced multiplexing and reduced set-up time resulting in a net gain in speed
of up to ~30 times. This approach is also insensitive to host galaxy
contamination. Prototype filters were built and successfully used on Magellan
with LDSS-3 to characterize three SNLS candidates. We discuss how these filters
can provide critical information for the upcoming photometric supernova
surveys.

20 z-dropouts, 15 Y-dropouts, and 20 J-dropouts. The surface densities of the
z-dropouts are close to what predicted by earlier studies, however, those of
the Y- and J-dropouts are quite unexpected. While no Y- or J-dropouts have been
found at AB < 28.0 mag, their surface densities seem to increase sharply at
fainter levels. While some of these candidates seem to be close to foreground
galaxies and thus could possibly be gravitationally lensed, the overall surface
densities after excluding such cases are still much higher than what would be
expected if the luminosity function does not evolve from z~7 to 10. Motivated
by such steep increases, we tentatively propose a set of Schechter function
parameters to describe the LFs at z~8 and 10. As compared to their counterpart
at z~7, here L* decreases by ~ 6.5x and Phi* increases by 17--90x. Although
such parameters are not yet demanded by the existing observations, they are
allowed and seem to agree with the data better than other alternatives. If
these LFs are still valid beyond our current detection limit, this would imply
a sudden emergence of a large number of low-luminosity galaxies when looking
back in time to z~10, which, while seemingly exotic, would naturally fit in the
picture of the cosmic hydrogen reionization. These early galaxies could easily
account for the ionizing photon budget required by the reionization, and they
would imply that the global star formation rate density might start from a very
high value at z~10, rapidly reach the minimum at z~7, and start to rise again
towards z~6. In this scenario, the majority of the stellar mass that the
universe assembled through the reionization epoch seems still undetected by
current observations at z~6. [Abridged]

widths that increase with the line energy, from sigma~1 eV for O VIII to
sigma~5.5 eV for Si XIV; the X-ray spectrum is reasonably well fit by a plasma
model with a Gaussian emission measure distribution that peaks at log
T(K)=7.16, has a width sigma=0.48, an Fe abundance equal to 0.44 times solar,
and other metal (primarily Ne, Mg, and Si) abundances equal to 0.76 times
solar; and for a distance d=100 pc, the total emission measure EM=8.0E53 cm^-3
and the 0.5-10 keV luminosity L_X=1.1E31 erg/s. Second, based on the f/(i+r)
flux ratios of the forbidden (f), intercombination (i), and recombination (r)
lines of the He alpha triplets of N VI, O VII, and Ne IX measured by Itoh et
al. in the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectrum and those of O
VII, Ne IX, Mg XI, and Si XIII in the Chandra HETG spectrum, either the
electron density of the plasma increases with temperature by over three orders
of magnitude, from n_e~6E10 cm^-3 for N VI to n_e~1E14 cm^-3 for SI XIII,
and/or the plasma is significantly affected by photoexcitation. Third, the
radial velocity of the X-ray emission lines varies on the white dwarf spin
phase, with two oscillations per spin cycle and an amplitude K~160 km/s. These
results appear to be inconsistent with the recent models of Itoh et al.,
Ikhsanov, and Venter & Meintjes of an extended, low-density source of X-rays in
AE Aqr, but instead support earlier models in which the dominant source of
X-rays is of high density and/or in close proximity to the white dwarf.

orbits is addressed using two different approximation techniques in general
relativity. The post-Newtonian (PN) approximation involves an expansion in
powers of v/c<<1, and is most appropriate for small orbital velocities v. The
perturbative self-force (SF) analysis requires an extreme mass ratio m1/m2<<1
for the components of the binary. A particular coordinate-invariant observable
is determined as a function of the orbital frequency of the system using these
two different approximations. The post-Newtonian calculation is pushed up to
the third post-Newtonian (3PN) order. It involves the metric generated by two
point particles and evaluated at the location of one of the particles. We
regularize the divergent self-field of the particle by means of dimensional
regularization. We show that the poles proportional to 1/(d-3) appearing in
dimensional regularization at the 3PN order cancel out from the final gauge
invariant observable. The 3PN analytical result, through first order in the
mass ratio, and the numerical SF calculation are found to agree well. The
consistency of this cross cultural comparison confirms the soundness of both
approximations in describing compact binary systems. In particular, it provides
an independent test of the very different regularization procedures invoked in
the two approximation schemes.

the glueball mass but to exploit an adequate effective theory to the point of
breaking and to analyze which kind of mechanisms restore compatibility with

understanding of the phenomena. The outcome of our calculation leads to a large
mass glueball $M_\Theta>2000$ MeV, to a large glue content of the $\eta^\prime$
and to mixing angles in agreement with previous numerical studies.

technique is described, which can significantly reduce drift related image
corruptions. Drift-distortion commonly causes blur and distortions in the SEM
images. Such corruption ordinarily appears when conventional image-acquisition
methods, i.e. ""slow scan"" and ""fast scan"", are applied. The damage is often
very significant; it may render images unusable for metrology applications,
especially, where sub-nanometer accuracy is required. The described correction
technique works with a large number of quickly taken frames, which are properly
aligned and then composed into a single image. Such image contains much less
noise than the individual frames, whilst the blur and deformation is minimized.
This technique also provides useful information about changes of the sample
position in time, which may be applied to investigate the drift properties of
the instrument without a need of additional equipment.

photospheric absorption lines are narrow, and we use the Fourier transform

maximum rotational period of 31.5 d, a value qualitatively consistent with the
observed variability of the optical absorption and emission lines, as well as
the Stokes $V$ profiles and longitudinal field. Using a Bayesian analysis of
the velocity-resolved Stokes $V$ profiles to infer the magnetic field

$1680^{+134}_{-356}$ G. The derived field strength and wind characteristics
imply a wind that is strongly confined by the magnetic field.

the HXR time profiles in different energy channels made with the Lomb

pronounced in the thermal HXR emission and were observed both in the impulsive

determined time periods of the QPP and the estimated physical parameters of
magnetic loops in the flare region allow us to interpret the observations as
follows. 1) In the impulsive phase energy was released and electrons were
accelerated by successive acts with the average time period of about 36 seconds
in different parts of two spatially separated, but interacting loop systems of
the flare region. 2) The 36-second periodicity of energy release could be
caused by the action of fast MHD oscillations in the loops connecting these
flaring sites. 3) During the first explosive acts of energy release the MHD
oscillations (most probably the sausage mode) with time period of 16 seconds
were excited in one system of the flare loops. 4) These oscillations were
maintained by the subsequent explosive acts of energy release in the impulsive
phase and were completely damped in the decay phase of the flare.

luminosity-metallicity or mass-metallicity (M-Z) relation for all kinds of

interstellar medium. We have obtained the mass-metallicity relation at
different lookback times for the same set of galaxies from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), using the stellar metallicities estimated with our spectral
synthesis code STARLIGHT. Using stellar metallicities has several advantages:
We are free of the biases that affect the calibration of nebular metallicities;
we can include in our study objects for which the nebular metallicity cannot be
measured, such as AGN hosts and passive galaxies; we can probe metallicities at
different epochs of a galaxy evolution.
  We have found that the M-Z relation steepens and spans a wider range in both
mass and metallicity at higher redshifts for SDSS galaxies. We also have
modeled the time evolution of stellar metallicity with a closed-box chemical
evolution model, for galaxies of different types and masses. Our results
suggest that the M-Z relation for galaxies with present-day stellar masses down
to 10^10 solar masses is mainly driven by the star formation history and not by
inflows or outflows.

amplification by the collision of two plasma clouds, each consisting of
electrons and ions, at a speed of 0.5c is investigated. A quasi-parallel
guiding magnetic field, a cloud density ratio of 10 and a plasma temperature of
25 keV are considered. A quasi-planar shock forms at the front of the dense
plasma cloud. It is mediated by a circularly left-hand polarized
electromagnetic wave with an electric field component along the guiding
magnetic field. Its propagation direction is close to that of the guiding field
and orthogonal to the collision boundary. It has a low frequency and a
wavelength that equals several times the ion inertial length, which would be
indicative of a dispersive Alfven wave close to the ion cyclotron resonance
frequency of the left-handed mode (ion whistler), provided that the frequency
is appropriate. However, it moves with the super-alfvenic plasma collision
speed, suggesting that it is an Alfven precursor or a nonlinear MHD wave such
as a Short Large-Amplitude Magnetic Structure (SLAMS). The growth of the
magnetic amplitude of this wave to values well in excess of those of the
quasi-parallel guiding field and of the filamentation modes results in a
quasi-perpendicular shock. We present evidence for the instability of this mode
to a four wave interaction. The waves developing upstream of the dense cloud
give rise to electron acceleration ahead of the collision boundary. Energy
equipartition between the ions and the electrons is established at the shock
and the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds.

(GRBs) in the prior emission model, which is proposed to explain the plateau
phase of the X-ray afterglow. This model predicts the high-energy gamma-ray
emission when the prompt GRB photons from the main flow are up-scattered by
relativistic electrons accelerated at the external shock due to the prior flow.
The expected spectrum has the peak of 10-100 GeV at around the end time of the
plateau phase for typical GRBs, and high-energy gamma rays from nearby and/or
energetic GRBs can be detected by current and future Cherenkov telescopes such
as MAGIC, VERITAS, CTA, and possibly Fermi. Multi-wavelength observations by
ground-based optical telescopes as well as Fermi and/or Swift sattelites are
important to constrain the model. Such external inverse-Compton emission may
even lead to GeV-TeV gamma-ray signals with the delay time of 10-100 s, only if
the plateau phase is short-lived.

braneworld gravity with a smooth dark energy component on the brane. The
expansion history in this model is identical to LambdaCDM, thus evading all
geometric constraints on the DGP cross-over scale r_c. This model can serve as
a first approximation to more general braneworld models whose cosmological
solutions have not been obtained yet. We study the formation of large scale
structure in this model in the linear and non-linear regime using N-body
simulations for different values of r_c. The simulations use the code presented
in (F.S., arXiv:0905.0858) and solve the full non-linear equation for the
brane-bending mode in conjunction with the usual gravitational dynamics. The
brane-bending mode is attractive rather than repulsive in the DGP normal
branch, hence the sign of the modified gravity effects is reversed compared to
those presented in arXiv:0905.0858. We compare the simulation results with
those of ordinary LambdaCDM simulations run using the same code and initial
conditions. We find that the matter power spectrum in this model shows a
characteristic enhancement peaking at k ~ 0.7 h/Mpc. We also find that the
abundance of massive halos is significantly enhanced. Other results presented
here include the density profiles of dark matter halos, and signatures of the
brane-bending mode self-interactions (Vainshtein mechanism) in the simulations.
Independently of the expansion history, these results can be used to place
constraints on the DGP model and future generalizations through their effects

Emphasis is placed on the fundamental concepts involved in deriving a
macroscopic hydrodynamic description for the granular material in terms of the
hydrodynamic fields (species densities, flow velocity, and the granular
temperature) from a prescribed ""microscopic"" interaction among the grains. To
this end, the role of the interstitial gas phase, body forces such as gravity,
and other coupling to the environment are suppressed and retained only via a
possible non-conservative external force and implicit boundary conditions. The
general notion of a kinetic equation is introduced to obtain macroscopic
balance equations for the fields. Constitutive equations for the fluxes in
these balance equations are obtained from special ""normal"" solutions to the
kinetic equation, resulting in a closed set of hydrodynamic equations. This
general constructive procedure is illustrated for the Boltzmann-Enskog kinetic
equation describing a system of smooth, inelastic hard spheres. For weakly
inhomogeneous fluid states the granular Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations
are obtained, including exact integral equations for the transport
coefficients. A method to obtain practical solutions to these integral
equations is described. Finally, a brief discussion is given for hydrodynamics

residual trend between luminosity-weighted mean stellar age and environment,
such that galaxies with older stellar populations favor regions of higher
overdensity relative to galaxies of like color and luminosity (and hence of
like stellar mass). Even when excluding galaxies with recent star-formation
activity (i.e., younger mean stellar ages) from the sample, we still find a
highly significant correlation between stellar age and environment at fixed

an assembly bias on the red sequence such that galaxies in higher-density
regions formed earlier than galaxies of similar mass in lower-density
environments. We discuss these results in the context of the age-metallicity
degeneracy and in comparison to previous studies at low and intermediate
redshift. Finally, we consider the potential role of assembly bias in

Kuiper belt starting from an initial size distribution similar to that produced
by accretion simulations of that region - a steep power-law large object size
distribution that breaks to a shallower slope at r ~1-2 km, with collisional
equilibrium achieved for objects r ~0.5 km. We find that the break from the
steep large object power-law causes a divot, or depletion of objects at r
~10-20 km, which in-turn greatly reduces the disruption rate of objects with r>
25-50 km, preserving the steep power-law behavior for objects at this size. Our
calculations demonstrate that the roll-over observed in the Kuiper belt size
distribution is naturally explained as an edge of a divot in the size
distribution; the radius at which the size distribution transitions away from
the power-law, and the shape of the divot from our simulations are consistent
with the size of the observed roll-over, and size distribution for smaller
bodies. Both the kink radius and the radius of the divot center depend on the
strength scaling law in the gravity regime for Kuiper belt objects. These
simulations suggest that the sky density of r ~1 km objects is ~10^6-10^7
objects per square degree. A detection of the divot in the size distribution
would provide a measure of the strength of large Kuiper belt objects, and
constrain the shape of the size distribution at the end of accretion in the

dilute triplons near the critical field can explain the magnetic ordering in
this material. For example, we investigate the temperature range where the BEC
picture of triplons can be applied via the HFP approach. We also determine the
temperature regime where a quadratic approximation of the triplon dispersion
works. It is found that the strength of the effective repulsive interaction
between triplons is much weaker in Ba$_{3}$Cr$_{2}$O$_8$ than in the canonical

compare spectra computed from the gas distributions to those computed from the
pressureless dark matter. The coherence along neighboring sightlines is
markedly higher for the hotter, higher pressure simulation, and lower for the

separated by Delta theta <= 15"" are ideal for probing this transverse

Array, towards 31 Galactic intermediate- and high-mass clumps detected in
previous millimeter continuum observations. In the 10 observed fields, 35 HII
regions are identified, of which 20 are newly discovered. Many of the HII
regions are multiply peaked indicating the presence of a cluster of massive
stars. We find that the ionized gas tends to be associated towards the
millimeter clumps; of the 31 millimeter clumps observed, 9 of these appear to
be physically related to ionized gas, and a further 6 have ionized gas emission
within 1'. For clumps with associated ionized gas, the combined mass of the
ionizing massive stars is compared to the clump masses to provide an estimate
of the instantaneous star formation efficiency. These values range from a few
percent to 25%, and have an average of 7 +/- 8%. We also find a correlation
between the clump mass and the mass of the ionizing massive stars within it,
which is consistent with a power law. This result is comparable to the
prediction of star formation by competitive accretion that a power law
relationship exists between the mass of the most massive star in a cluster and
the total mass of the remaining stars.

holes with masses ranging between $10^{2-4}\,M_{\odot}$) has not yet been
corroborated observationally, these objects are of high interest for
astrophysics. Our understanding of the formation and evolution of supermassive
black holes (SMBHs), as well as galaxy evolution modeling and cosmography would
dramatically change if an IMBH were to be observed. From a point of view of
traditional photon-based astronomy, {which relies on the monitoring of
innermost stellar kinematics}, the {\em direct} detection of an IMBH seems to
be rather far in the future. However, the prospect of the detection and
characterization of an IMBH has good chances in lower-frequency
gravitational-wave (GW) astrophysics using ground-based detectors such as LIGO,
Virgo and the future Einstein Telescope (ET). We present an analysis of the
signal of a system of a binary of IMBHs (BBH from now onwards) based on a
waveform model obtained with numerical relativity simulations coupled with
post-Newtonian calculations at the highest available order. IMBH binaries with
total masses between $200-20000\,M_\odot$ would produce significant
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in advanced LIGO and Virgo and the ET. We have
computed the expected event rate of IMBH binary coalescences for different
configurations of the binary, finding interesting values that depend on the
spin of the IMBHs. The prospects for IMBH detection and characterization with
ground-based GW observatories would not only provide us with a robust test of
general relativity, but would also corroborate the existence of these systems.
Such detections should allow astrophysicists to probe the stellar environments
of IMBHs and their formation processes.

velocity scale of thermal broadening and the Hubble flow across the gas Jeans
scale are of similar magnitude (Hlambda_J ~ sigma_th). To separate the effects
of gas pressure support and thermal broadening on the Lya forest, we compare
spectra extracted from two smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations
evolved with different photoionization heating rates (and thus different Jeans
scales), imposing different temperature-density relations on the evolved
particle distributions. The turnover scales in the flux power spectrum and flux
autocorrelation function are determined mainly by thermal broadening rather
than pressure. However, the insensitivity to pressure arises partly from a
cancellation effect with a sloped temperature-density relation (T ~ rho^{0.6}
in our simulations): the high density peaks in the colder, lower pressure
simulation are less smoothed by pressure support than in the hotter simulation,
and it is this higher density gas that experiences the strongest thermal
broadening. Changes in thermal broadening and pressure support have comparably
important effects on the flux probability distribution (PDF), which responds
directly to the gas overdensity distribution rather than the scale on which it
is smooth. Tests on a lower resolution simulation show that our statistical
results are converged even at this lower resolution. While thermal broadening
generally dominates the longitudinal structure in the Lya forest, we show in
Paper II that pressure support determines the transverse coherence of the
forest observed towards close quasar pairs. [ABRIDGED]

regions structure formation is erroneously delayed in simulations starting from
Zel'dovich initial conditions, and we demonstrate for the case of the formation

allow simulations to start later, saving computer time.

that the Bs pair will then be in an eigenstate of charge conjugation (i.e.
C=-1) and therefore in an entangled state. This allows for a determination of
Delta Gamma/Gamma and the CP phase using a number of possible correlations
between the decays of the two Bs mesons. In particular, we consider the time

about O(10^7-10^8) Upsilon(5s) events available at B factories, we find that
the time ordering asymmetry between suitably defined hadronic and flavor
specific (tagging) decays offers a promising method for determining the width
difference. The corresponding time ordering-charge asymmetry can also bound the
mixing phase. Similar observables involving exclusive decays are also
considered. At the super B factories with O(50) times greater luminosity time
ordering and time ordering-charge asymmetries between inclusive and exclusive

as test particles and have measured the vertical velocity dispersion (sigma_z)
throughout the disks of five nearby, low-inclination spiral galaxies: IC 342,
M74 (NGC 628), M83 (NGC 5236), M94 (NGC 4736), and M101 (NGC 5457). By using HI
to map galactic rotation and the epicyclic approximation to extract sigma_z
from the line-of-sight dispersion, we find that, with the lone exception of
M101, our disks do have a constant M/L out to ~3 optical scale lengths.
However, once outside this radius, sigma_z stops declining and becomes flat
with radius. Possible explanations for this behavior include an increase in the
disk mass-to-light ratio, an increase in the importance of the thick disk, and
heating of the thin disk by halo substructure. We also find that the disks of
early type spirals have higher values of M/L and are closer to maximal than the
disks of later-type spirals, and that the unseen inner halos of these systems
are better fit by pseudo-isothermal laws than by NFW models.

ferroelectric PbTiO3 for the case of a polarization-enhancing electric field
applied along the tetragonal axis. We focus mainly on the case of fixed
in-plane lattice constants, corresponding to epitaxially constrained thin
films. We find that the dependence of the c/a ratio on electric field is almost
linear in the range up to 500 MV/m, with little saturation. This result
contrasts with expectations from Landau-Devonshire approaches based on
experimental results obtained at lower fields, but is in qualitative agreement
with a recent experiment in which higher fields were attained using
pulsed-field methods. We also study cases in which the in-plane epitaxy
constraint is removed, or an artificial negative pressure is applied, or both.
These calculations demonstrate that PbTiO3 can show a strikingly non-linear
piezoelectric response under modified elastic boundary conditions.

  The author presents explicit formulas suitable for a digital computer

Lorentzian frame is unique.
  Using this field he introduces the retarded time field and fundamental fields

positions of the lines of flow.
  By means of these fields one can represent and establish relations between

the basic existence results. We prove that MA implies there exist many pairwise
orthogonal families, and that CH implies that for any very mad family there is
one orthogonal to it. Finally we prove that the axiom of constructibility
implies that there exists a coanalytic very mad family. Cofinitary groups have
a natural action on the natural numbers. We prove that a maximal cofinitary
group cannot have infinitely many orbits under this action, but can have any
combination of any finite number of finite orbits and any finite (but nonzero)
number of infinite orbits.
  We also prove that there exists a maximal cofinitary group into which each
countable group embeds. This gives an example of a maximal cofinitary group
that is not a free group. We start the investigation into which groups have
cofinitary actions. The main result there is that it is consistent that
$\bigoplus_{\alpha \in \aleph_1} \mathbb{Z}_2$ has a cofinitary action.
  Concerning the complexity of maximal cofinitary groups we prove that they
cannot be $K_\sigma$, but that the axiom of constructibility implies that there
exists a coanalytic maximal cofinitary group. We prove that the least
cardinality $\mathfrak{a}_g$ of a maximal cofinitary group can consistently be
less than the cofinality of the symmetric group. Finally we prove that

coefficients of simple monatomic, equilibrium fluids in specific dimensionless
forms makes them approximately single-valued functions of excess entropy. This
has predictive value because, while the transport coefficients of dense fluids
are difficult to estimate from first principles, excess entropy can often be
accurately predicted from liquid-state theory. Here, we use molecular
simulations to investigate whether Rosenfeld's observation is a special case of
a more general scaling law relating mobility of particles in mixtures to excess
entropy. Specifically, we study tracer diffusivities, static structure, and
thermodynamic properties of a variety of one- and two-component model fluid
systems with either additive or non-additive interactions of the hard-sphere or
Gaussian-core form. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the effects
of mixture concentration and composition, particle-size asymmetry and
additivity, and strength of the interparticle interactions in these fluids are
consistent with an empirical scaling law relating the excess entropy to a new
dimensionless (generalized Rosenfeld) form of tracer diffusivity, which we
introduce here. The dimensionless form of the tracer diffusivity follows from
knowledge of the intermolecular potential and the transport / thermodynamic
behavior of fluids in the dilute limit. The generalized Rosenfeld scaling
requires less information, and provides more accurate predictions, than either
Enskog theory or scalings based on the pair-correlation contribution to the
excess entropy. As we show, however, it also suffers from some limitations,
especially for systems that exhibit significant decoupling of individual
component tracer diffusivities.

that these hypergraphic relaxations are equivalent to the well studied
bidirected cut relaxation, if the instance is quasibipartite. Integrality gap

typically obeys the so-called Tanner law, with the instantaneous base radius
R(t) growing with time as R ~ t^{1/10} -- an effect of the dominant role of
capillary forces for a small-sized droplet. However, for droplets of nematic
liquid crystals, a faster spreading law sets in at long times, so that R ~
t^alpha with alpha significantly larger than the Tanner exponent 1/10. In the
framework of the thin film model (or lubrication approximation), we describe
this ""acceleration"" as a transition to a qualitatively different spreading
regime driven by a strong substrate-liquid interaction specific to nematics
(antagonistic anchoring at the interfaces). The numerical solution of the thin
film equation agrees well with the available experimental data for nematics,
even though the non-Newtonian rheology has yet to be taken into account. Thus
we complement the theory of spreading with a post-Tanner stage, noting that the

capillarity-dominated stage to a regime where the whole reservoir becomes a

Four cases with different values of initial plasma beta were considered. Our

fluctuations of magnetic field strength and gas density. So the magnetic field
strength estimated with RM/DM (DM is the dispersion measure) correctly
represents the true mean strength of the magnetic field along the line of
sight. (2) The frequency distribution of RMs is well fitted to the Gaussian. In
addition, there is a good relation between the width of the distribution of
RM/$\bar{\rm RM}$ ($\bar{\rm RM}$ is the average value of RMs) and the strength
of the regular field along the line of sight; the width is narrower, if the

Magellanic Cloud have been made. The 12CO J=4-3 distribution is separated into
three clumps. These new measurements toward the three clumps are used in
coupled calculations of molecular rotational excitation and line radiation
transfer, along with other transitions of the 12CO as well as the isotope
transitions of 13CO. The temperatures and densities are determined to be
~70-80K and ~3x10^3 cm-3 in N159W and N159E and ~30K and ~1.6x10^3 cm-3 in
N159S. These results are compared with the star formation activity. The N159E
clump is associated with embedded cluster(s) as observed at 24 micron and the
derived high temperature is explained as due to the heating by these sources.
The N159E clump is likely responsible for a dark lane in a large HII region by
the dust extinction. The N159W clump is associated with embedded clusters
mainly toward the eastern edge of the clump only. These clusters show offsets
of 20""-40"" from the 12CO J=4-3 peak and are probably responsible for heating
indicated by the derived high temperature. The N159W clump exhibits no sign of
star formation toward the 12CO J=4-3 peak position and its western region. We
suggest that the N159W peak represents a pre-star-cluster core of ~105M_sol
which deserves further detailed studies. Note that recent star formation took
place between N159W and N159E as indicated by several star clusters and HII
regions, while the natal molecular gas toward the stars have already been
dissipated by the ionization and stellar winds of the OB stars. The N159S clump
shows little sign of star formation as is consistent with the lower temperature
and somewhat lower density. The N159S clump is also a candidate for future star
formation.

mass, dark matter concentrations (haloes) as small as 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ will
contain a minimum of 100 particles.Here, we use this simulation to test a model
of metal-poor globular cluster formation based on collapse physics. In our
model, globular clusters form when the virial temperatures of haloes first
exceed $10^4$ K as this is when electronic transitions allow the gas to cool
efficiently. We calculate the ionising flux from the stars in these first
clusters and stop the formation of new clusters when all the baryonic gas of
the galaxy is ionised. This is achieved by adopting reasonable values for the
star formation efficiencies and escape fraction of ionising photons. The model
is successful in that it predicts ages (peak age $\sim$ 13.3 Gyrs) and a
spatial distribution of metal-poor globular clusters which are consistent with
the observed populations in the Milky Way. We then test a scenario of
metal-rich cluster formation by examining mergers that trigger star formation
within central gas disks. This results in younger ($\sim$ 7--13.3 Gyrs), more
centrally-located clusters (40 metal-rich GCs within 18 kpc from the centre of
the host) which are consistent with the Galactic metal-rich population. We test
an alternate model in which metal-rich globular clusters form in dwarf galaxies
that become stripped as they merge with the main halo. We find that this
process is inconsistent with observed metal-rich globulars.

manner to astrophysical jets provided that radiation, viscosity, and thermal
conductivity are unimportant in the laboratory jets, and that the experimental

number and the ratio of the density between the jet and the ambient medium.
Laboratory jets can be studied for a variety of initial conditions, arbitrary
viewing angles, and different times, attributes especially helpful for
interpreting astronomical images where the viewing angle and initial conditions
are fixed and the time domain is limited. Experiments are also a powerful way
to test numerical fluid codes in a parameter range where the codes must perform
well. In this paper we combine images from a series of laboratory experiments
of deflected supersonic jets with numerical simulations and new spectral
observations of an astrophysical example, the young stellar jet HH 110. The
experiments provide key insights into how deflected jets evolve in 3-D,
particularly within working surfaces where multiple subsonic shells and
filaments form, and along the interface where shocked jet material penetrates
into and destroys the obstacle along its path. The experiments also underscore
the importance of the viewing angle in determining what an observer will see.
The simulations match the experiments so well that we can use the simulated
velocity maps to compare the dynamics in the experiment with those implied by
the astronomical spectra. The experiments support a model where the observed
shock structures in HH 110 form as a result of a pulsed driving source rather
than from weak shocks that may arise in the supersonic shear layer between the
Mach disk and bow shock of the jet's working surface.

feedback communication, estimation, and feedback control over Gaussian
channels, from a unifying perspective for information, estimation, and control.
The optimal feedback communication system over a Gaussian necessarily employs
the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm, and hence can be transformed into an
estimation system and a feedback control system over the same channel. This
follows that the information rate of the communication system is alternatively
given by the decay rate of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the estimation system
and by the Bode integral (BI) of the control system. Furthermore, the optimal
tradeoff between the channel input power and information rate in feedback
communication is alternatively characterized by the optimal tradeoff between
the (causal) one-step prediction mean-square error (MSE) and (anti-causal)
smoothing MSE (of an appropriate form) in estimation, and by the optimal
tradeoff between the regulated output variance with causal feedback and the
disturbance rejection measure (BI or degree of anti-causality) in feedback
control. All these optimal tradeoffs have an interpretation as the tradeoff
between causality and anti-causality. Utilizing and motivated by these
relations, we provide several new results regarding the feedback codes and
information theoretic characterization of KF. Finally, the extension of the
finite-horizon results to infinite horizon is briefly discussed under specific
dimension assumptions (the asymptotic feedback capacity problem is left open in
this paper).

gravitational waves (RGWs) over the whole range of frequency $(10^{-18}\sim

Analytical calculations show that, although the spectrum of RGWs on low
frequencies is less affected by $\alpha_t\ne 0$, but, on high frequencies, the
spectrum is modified substantially. Investigations are made toward potential
detections of the $\alpha_t$-modified RGWs for several kinds of current and
planned detectors. The Advanced LIGO will likely be able to detect RGWs with
$\alpha_t\ge 0$ for inflationary models with the inflation index $\beta=-1.956$
and the tensor-scalar ratio $r= 0.55$. The future LISA can detect RGWs for a
much broader range of ($\alpha_t$, $\beta$, $r$), and will have a better chance
to break a degeneracy between them. Constraints on $\alpha_t$ are estimated
from several detections and cosmological observations. Among them, the most
stringent one is from the bound of the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and
requires $\alpha_t < 0.008$ rather conservatively for any reasonable ($\beta$,
$r$), preferring a nearly power-law spectrum of RGWs. In light of this result,
one would expect the scalar running index $\alpha_s$ to be of the same
magnitude as $\alpha_t$, if both RGWs and scalar perturbations are generated by
the same scalar inflation.

distributions of the magnetic fields inside the hybrid stars, making the
maximum field strength about up to 30 % larger than for the normal neutron
stars. Using the equilibrium configurations, we explore the possible
evolutionary paths to the formation of hybrid stars due to the spin-down of
magnetized rotating neutron stars. We find that the energy release by the phase
transition to the hybrid stars is quite large ($\la 10^{52} \rm erg$) even for

jets. There is growing evidence that jets in radio galaxies consist of a fast
low density outflow at the jet axis, surrounded by a slower, denser, extended
jet. The inner and outer jet components then have a different origin and
launching mechanism, making their effective inertia, magnetization, associated
energy flux and angular momentum content different as well. Their interface
will develop differential rotation, where disruptions may occur. We here
investigate the stability of rotating, two-component relativistic outflows
typical for jets in radio galaxies. For this purpose, we parametrically explore
the long term evolution of a transverse cross-section of radially stratified
jets numerically With grid-adaptive relativistic MHD simulations, augmented
with approximate linear stability analysis. We study the influence of
dynamically important poloidal magnetic fields, with varying contributions of
the inner component jet to the total kinetic energy flux of the jet, on their
non-linear azimuthal stability. We demonstrate that two-component jets with
high kinetic energy flux, and an inner jet effective inertia which is higher
than the outer jet effective inertia are subject to the development of a
relativistically enhanced, rotation-induced Rayleigh-Taylor type instability.
This instability plays a major role in decelerating the inner jet and the
overall jet decollimation. This novel deceleration scenario can partly explain
the radio source dichotomy, relating it directly to the efficiency of the
central engine in launching the inner jet component. The FRII/FRI transition
could then occur when the relative kinetic energy flux of the inner to the
outer jet grows beyond a certain treshold.

into account the air entrainment by a system of four partial differential
equations. We derive it by taking averaged values of gas and fluid velocities
on the cross surface flow in the Euler equations (incompressible for the fluid
and compressible for the gas). The obtained system is conditionally hyperbolic.
Then, we propose a mathematical kinetic interpretation of this system to
finally construct a two-layer kinetic scheme in which a special treatment for
the ""missing"" boundary condition is performed. Several numerical tests on
closed water pipes are performed and the impact of the loss of hyperbolicity is
discussed and illustrated. Finally, we make a numerical study of the order of
the kinetic method in the case where the system is mainly non hyperbolic. This
provides a useful stability result when the spatial mesh size goes to zero.

divided into $m_n$ blocks $(Y_{n,j})$, and if a block contains at least one
extreme value, the block is considered to contain a cluster. The cluster starts
at the first extreme value in the block and ends at the last one. The main
results are uniform central limit theorems for empirical processes
$Z_n(f):=\frac{1}{\sqrt {nv_n}}\sum_{j=1}^{m_n}(f(Y_{n,j})-Ef(Y_{n,j})),$ for
$v_n=P\{X_{n,i}\neq0\}$ and $f$ belonging to classes of cluster functionals,
that is, functions of the blocks $Y_{n,j}$ which only depend on the cluster
values and which are equal to 0 if $Y_{n,j}$ does not contain a cluster.
Conditions for finite-dimensional convergence include $\beta$-mixing, suitable
Lindeberg conditions and convergence of covariances. To obtain full uniform
convergence, we use either ""bracketing entropy"" or bounds on covering numbers

powerful Vapnik--\v{C}ervonenkis theory to bear. Applications include
multivariate tail empirical processes and empirical processes of cluster values

the analysis of extreme values, the theory can be applied more generally to
rare events occurring, for example, in nonparametric curve estimation.

by at Theory of Exclusively Local Beables. What the author of [2] considers to
be his crucial proposal is described in the title of section 3 as 'complicated,
ugly, and highly contrived'. The reason for such a proposal is claimed to be
the widespread perception among quantum physicists, according to which 'those
sympathetic to the pilot-wave ontology no doubt expected that, for a system of
N particles moving in three spatial dimensions, the theoretical description
would be of N wave-particle pairs - each pair consisting of a point particle
guided in some way by an associated wave propagating in 3-space. But
Schroedinger's wave function for such an N-particle system was emphatically not
a set of N (interacting) waves, each propagating in 3-space. It was, rather, a
single wave propagating in the 3N-dimensional configuration space for the
system', [2, p. 5]. In the present paper it is argued that the mentioned
widespread expectation need not be seen as being betrayed by what actually
happens. In particular, the construction in section 3 of [2] may be avoidable.

their density distributions, their evolution, their geometry, and their causal
structure. Observations are strongly affected by the detailed geometry and
evolution of a model, and therefore interpretation of observations depends on
understanding them.
  It is generally assumed the universe is homogeneous if averaged over large
enough scales, but to actually prove this is so, will require the assumption to
be relaxed, and a rigorous inhomogeneous approach to be applied. Though the \LT
metric has long been used for models of spherical inhomogeneities, there have

models with specific properties, and their application to cosmic structures on
several different scales. Interest in the Szekeres metrics is on the increase,

the free energy of the complex formation is caused by the disruption/formation
of the coordinate bonds between Mg2+, water molecules and the ligand. Another
important contribution to the complex formation energy is change of
electrostatic interactions in water solvent upon the ligand binding with Mg2+
ion. For all complexes under investigation the reasonable (in frame of 2
kcal/mol) agreement between calculated and experimental values are achieved.

context: state-specific and state-independent optimal control. For the former,
we present an extension of conventional theory (Pontryagin's principle) to
quantum systems which undergo a non-Markovian time-evolution. Owing to its
importance for the realization of quantum information processing, the main body
of the review, however, is devoted to state-independent optimal control. Here,
we address three different approaches: an approach which treats dissipative
effects from the environment in lowest-order perturbation theory, a general
method based on the time--evolution superoperator concept, as well as one based
on the Kraus representation of the time-evolution superoperator. Applications
which illustrate these new methods focus on single and double qubits (quantum
gates) whereby the environment is modeled either within the Lindblad equation
or a bath of bosons (spin-boson model). While these approaches are widely
applicable, we shall focus our attention to solid-state based physical
realizations, such as semiconductor- and superconductor-based systems. While an
attempt is made to reference relevant and representative work throughout the

the framework of 5D gravity coupled to a scalar field depending on the extra
dimension. It turns out that when analyzing localization of 4D gravity in this
smooth version of the Randall-Sundrum model, a kind of dichotomy emerges. In
the first case the geometry is completely smooth and the spectrum of metric
fluctuations shows a single massless bound state, corresponding to the 4D
graviton, and a tower of massive states described by a continuous spectrum of
Kaluza-Klein excitations starting from zero mass, indicating the lack of a mass
gap. In the second case, there are two bound states, a massless 4D graviton and
a massive excitation, separated by a mass gap from a continuous spectrum of
massive modes; nevertheless, the presence of a mass gap in the graviton
spectrum of the theory is responsible for a naked singularity at the boundaries
(or spatial infinity) of the Riemannian manifold. However, the imposition of
unitary boundary conditions, which is equivalent to eliminating the continuous
spectrum of gravitational massive modes, renders these singularities harmless
from the physical point of view, providing the viability of the model.

tube rising through a stratified convection zone and atmosphere to interact and
reconnect with a horizontal overlying magnetic field in the atmosphere. Null
points appear as the reconnection begins and persist throughout the rest of the
emergence, where they can be found mostly in the model photosphere and
transition region, forming two loose clusters on either side of the emerging
flux tube. Up to 26 nulls are present at any one time, and tracking in time
shows that there is a total of 305 overall, despite the initial simplicity of
the magnetic field configuration. We find evidence for the reality of the nulls
in terms of their methods of creation and destruction, their balance of signs,
their long lifetimes, and their geometrical stability. We then show that due to
the low parallel electric fields associated with the nulls, null-point
reconnection is not the main type of magnetic reconnection involved in the
interaction of the newly emerged flux with the overlying field. However, the
large number of nulls implies that the topological structure of the magnetic
field must be very complex and the importance of reconnection along separators
or separatrix surfaces for flux emergence cannot be ruled out.

describe complete integrability in a contact set-up as a more subtle structure:
a flag of two foliations, Legendrian and co-Legendrian, and a
holonomy-invariant transverse measure of the former in the latter. This turns
out to be equivalent to the existence of a canonical $\R\ltimes \R^{n-1}$
structure on the leaves of the co-Legendrian foliation. Further, the above
structure implies the existence of $n$ contact fields preserving a special
contact 1-form, thus providing the geometric framework and establishing
equivalence with previously known definitions of contact integrability. We also
show that contact completely integrable systems are solvable in quadratures. We
present an example of contact complete integrability: the billiard system

oriented null geodesics. We describe a surprising acceleration mechanism for

in other jets from young stars. The overall trend of the physical parameters
along the first few arcseconds of the RW Aur jet is similar to that of HH 30

region, suggesting the same engine is accelerating the jets in the T Tauri
stars with outflows. Our study of the RW Aur jet indicates for the first time
that, despite the detected marked asymmetries in physical and kinematic

a vehicle communication channel access based on IEEE 802.11 mechanisms, radio
propagation modeling, message reception characteristics as well as all other
effects associated with ad-hoc networks are integrated into a three-phase
traffic flow model. Thus simulations of both vehicle ad-hoc network and traffic
flow are integrated onto a single testbed and perform simultaneously. This
allows us to make simulations of ad-hoc network performance as well as diverse
scenarios of the effect of wireless vehicle communications on traffic flow
during simulation times, which can be comparable with real characteristic times
in traffic flow. In addition, the testbed allows us to simulate cooperative
vehicle motion together with various traffic phenomena, like traffic breakdown
at bottlenecks, moving jam emergence, and a possible effect of danger warning
massages about the breakdown vehicle on traffic flow.

have lead to changing attitudes with respect to plantations. These artificial

their naturally established counterparts, key factors being high density,
homogeneous spatial structure, and their even-sized/aged nature.
  Transformation (manipulation of plantations to produce stands more
reminiscent of natural ones) represents a major challenge for forest managers,
and the shift from even- to uneven-aged stand management is far from simple.
Tree species' attributes, too, vary dramatically. This study aims to identify
generic aspects of forest population dynamics, in order to understand the
temporal evolution of single species forest stands from an initial plantation
lattice structure, into an ``old-growth'' state.
  This is achieved using a size-structured model, which implements simple rules
to simulate the growth and fate of individuals in a spatial arena. We
parameterise and discuss model behaviour in the context of available plantation
and semi-natural data from Caledonian Scots Pine stands. We move on to
illustrate the use of the model in predicting the outcome of silviculture, and
discuss results in the context of stand transformation.

processes that are described by generalized Langevin equations (GLE) and obey
thermal detailed balance under equilibrium conditions. At thermal equilibrium
superdiffusive behavior can emerge if the total integral of the memory kernel
vanishes. Such a situation of vanishing static friction is caused by a
super-Ohmic thermal bath. One of the simplest models of ballistic
superdiffusion is determined by a bi-exponential memory kernel that was
proposed by Bao [J.-D. Bao, J. Stat. Phys. 114, 503 (2004)]. We show that this
non-Markovian model has infinitely many different 4-dimensional Markovian
embeddings. Implementing numerically the simplest one, we demonstrate that (i)
the presence of a periodic potential with arbitrarily low barriers changes the
asymptotic large time behavior from free ballistic superdiffusion into normal
diffusion; (ii) an additional biasing force renders the asymptotic dynamics
superdiffusive again. The development of transients that display a
qualitatively different behavior compared to the true large-time asymptotics
presents a general feature of this non-Markovian dynamics. These transients
though may be extremely long. As a consequence, they can be even mistaken as
the true asymptotics. We find that such intermediate asymptotics exhibit a
giant enhancement of superdiffusion in tilted washboard potentials and it is
accompanied by a giant transient superballistic current growing proportional to
$t^{\alpha_{{\rm eff}}}$ with an exponent $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ that can exceed
the ballistic value of two.

is driven in the molecular interstellar medium, by comparing simulated
molecular spectral line observations of numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)

use principal component analysis, applied to both models and observational
data, to extract a quantitative measure of the driving scale of turbulence. We
find that only models driven at large scales (comparable to, or exceeding, the
size of the cloud) are consistent with observations. This result applies also
to clouds with little or no internal star formation activity. Astrophysical
processes acting on large scales, including supernova-driven turbulence,
magnetorotational instability, or spiral shock forcing, are viable candidates
for the generation and maintenance of molecular cloud turbulence. Small scale
driving by sources internal to molecular clouds, such as outflows, can be
important on small scales, but cannot replicate the observed large-scale

stress the connection between the initial condition in heavy ion collisions and
observables in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The dominant degree of freedom
in the small x nuclear wavefunction is a nonperturbatively strong classical
gluon field, which determines the initial condition for the glasma fields in
the initial stages of a heavy ion collision. A correlator of Wilson lines from
the same classical fields, known as the dipole cross section, can be used to
compute many inclusive and exclusive observables in DIS.

shows a systematic decline of the rotational velocity with height from the
plane (vertical gradient). This feature is not expected for a barotropic gas,
whilst it is well reproduced by baroclinic fluid homogeneous models. The
problem with the latter is that they require gas temperatures (above $10^5$ K)
much higher than the temperatures of the cold and warm components of the
extra-planar gas layer. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by
describing the extra-planar gas as a system of gas clouds obeying the Jeans
equations. In particular, we consider models having the observed extra-planar
gas distribution and gravitational potential of the disc galaxy NGC 891: for
each model we construct pseudo-data cubes and we compare them with the HI data
cube of NGC 891. In all cases the rotational velocity gradients are in
qualitative agreement with the observations, but the synthetic and the observed
data cubes of NGC 891 show systematic differences that cannot be accommodated
by any of the explored models. We conclude that the extra-planar gas in disc
galaxies cannot be satisfactorily described by a stationary Jeans-like system
of gas clouds.

results show that without the inclusion of the electron translation factors
(ETFs) the quantitative cross-section calculations up to velocity ~1.1 a.u.

charge transfer collision studies at low energies this diabatic molecular basis
can be used for benchmark calculations. With the aid of the Wannier's picture
of the ground state correlations, a combined detailed analysis and comparison
has been carried out to find a connection with the dynamic two-electron
correlation picture in charge transfer collision processes which involve
sequential/simultaneous two-electron exchange. If ETFs are included, the model

of random linear measurements. A popular and useful example of this problem is
matrix completion, in which the measurements reveal the values of a subset of
the entries, and we wish to fill in the missing entries (this is the famous
Netflix problem). When M is believed to have low rank, one would ideally try to
recover M by finding the minimum-rank matrix that is consistent with the data;
this is, however, problematic since this is a nonconvex problem that is,
generally, intractable.
  Nuclear-norm minimization has been proposed as a tractable approach, and past
papers have delved into the theoretical properties of nuclear-norm minimization
algorithms, establishing conditions under which minimizing the nuclear norm
yields the minimum rank solution. We review this spring of emerging literature
and extend and refine previous theoretical results. Our focus is on providing
error bounds when M is well approximated by a low-rank matrix, and when the
measurements are corrupted with noise. We show that for a certain class of
random linear measurements, nuclear-norm minimization provides stable recovery
from a number of samples nearly at the theoretical lower limit, and enjoys
order-optimal error bounds (with high probability).

frequency band $\nu_{\rm{obs}} \simeq 20-2000 {\rm Hz}$ for stars forming at
redshifts of up to $z\simeq 20.$ We study the possibility of detection of this
isotropic GW background by correlating signals of a pair of Advanced LIGO
observatories.

Final version, accepted to RMP",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Advances in the fabrication and characterization of nanoscale systems now
allow for a deeper understanding of one of the most basic issues in science and
technology: the flow of energy at the microscopic level. In this Colloquium we
survey recent advances and present understanding of physical mechanisms of
energy transport in nanostructures, focusing mainly on molecular junctions and
atomic wires. We examine basic issues such as thermal conductivity,
thermoelectricity, local temperature and heating, and the relation between
energy current density and temperature gradient - known as Fourier's law. We
critically report on both theoretical and experimental progress in each of
these issues, and discuss future research opportunities in the field.

This stochastic particle system can be viewed as a toy model for granular gases

large deviation functional for the particle currents flowing through the system
is computed and some physical consequences are discussed: the mechanism for
local current fluctuations, dynamical phase transitions, the
fluctuation-relation.

desired state or oscillate between mI=+1/2 and mI=-1/2 on the nanosecond time
scale. This approach provides a fast and efficient way of controlling nuclear
spin qubits and also enables the design of switchable spin-based quantum gates
by addressing only the electron spin.
