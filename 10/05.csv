qualitative insights into the non-perturbative physics of QCD. However, it is
known that at high densities the `t Hooft large N_c world looks very different
from the N_c=3 world, which is believed to be in a color superconducting phase
at high densities. At large N_c, on the other hand, the DGR instability causes
a chiral-density wave phase to dominate over the color superconducting phase.
There is an alternative large N_c limit, with the quarks transforming in the
two-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, which at N_c=3
reduces to QCD but looks quite different at large N_c. We show that in this
alternative large N_c limit, the DGR instability does not occur, so that it may
be plausible that the ground state of high-density quark matter is a color
superconductor even when N_c is large. This revives the hope that a large N_c
approximation might be useful for getting some insights into the high-density
phenomenology of QCD.

mechanisms of evaporation. A common agreement of the scientific community based
on experimental and numerical work evidences that most of the evaporation
occurs at the triple line. However, the rate of evaporation is still
empirically predicted due to the lack of knowledge on the convection cells
which develop inside the drop under evaporation. The evaporation of sessile
drop is more complicated than it appears due to the coupling by conduction with
the heating substrate, the convection and conduction inside the drop and the
convection and diffusion with the vapour phase. The coupling of heat transfer
in the three phases induces complicated cases to solve even for numerical
simulations. We present recent experimental fluid dynamics videos obtained
using a FLIR SC-6000 coupled with a microscopic lens of 10 micron of resolution
to observe the evaporation of sessile drops in infrared wavelengths. The range
of 3 to 5 micron is adapted to the fluids observed which are ethanol, methanol

large number of absorption lines from neutral and singly-ionized metals. Many
lines are complex emission/absorption blends. The LBV has a current temperature
of ~8500K (spectral type A3Ia+), and displays signs of photospheric pulsations

Oxygen depleted, indicative of surface CNO-processed material and considerable
previous mass-loss, although current time-averaged mass-loss rates are low. The
emission-line spectrum forms at large radii, when material lost by the LBV in a

interference alignment, and consequently the total number of degrees of freedom

share the common property that in each case the best known outer bounds are
essentially robust to channel uncertainty and represent the outcome with
interference alignment, but the best inner bounds -- in some cases conjectured
to be optimal -- predict a total collapse of DoF, thus indicating the
infeasibility of interference alignment under channel uncertainty at
transmitters. Our main contribution is to show that even with no knowledge of
channel coefficient values at the transmitters, the knowledge of the channels'
correlation structure can be exploited to achieve interference alignment. In
each case, we show that under a staggered block fading model, the transmitters
are able to align interference without the knowledge of channel coefficient

seen as a repetition code over a small number of symbols -- and involve delays

consider a scenario in which the observed X-ray emission from radio-loud BAL
quasars can be a sum of inverse-Compton jet X-ray emission and optically thin
corona X-ray emission. We compiled a sample of radio-loud BAL quasars that were
observed in X-rays to date and report no correlation between their X-ray and

holography leads to a semi-classical first approximation to the spectrum and
wavefunctions of meson and baryon light-quark bound states. Starting from the
bound-state Hamiltonian equation of motion in QCD, we derive relativistic
light-front wave equations in terms of an invariant impact variable zeta which
measures the separation of the quark and gluonic constituents within the hadron
at equal light-front time. These equations of motion in physical space-time are
equivalent to the equations of motion which describe the propagation of spin-J
modes in anti--de Sitter (AdS) space. Its eigenvalues give the hadronic
spectrum, and its eigenmodes represent the probability distribution of the
hadronic constituents at a given scale. Applications to the light meson and
baryon spectra are presented. The predicted meson spectrum has a string-theory
Regge form M^2 = 4 kappa^2(n+L+S/2); i.e., the square of the eigenmass is
linear in both L and n, where n counts the number of nodes of the wavefunction
in the radial variable zeta. The space-like pion form factor is also well
reproduced. One thus obtains a remarkable connection between the description of
hadronic modes in AdS space and the Hamiltonian formulation of QCD in physical
space-time quantized on the light-front at fixed light-front time. The model
can be systematically improved by using its complete orthonormal solutions to
diagonalize the full QCD light-front Hamiltonian or by applying the
Lippmann-Schwinger method in order to systematically include the QCD
interaction terms.

directed graphs with given node degrees as the model for interacting network.
This gives a rigorous mathematical proof of a phenomena observed by physicists
in neural networks.

close to any degree d polynomial in n variables, also known as the Reed-Muller
testing problem. The Gowers norm is based on a natural 2^{d+1}-query test for
this property. Alon et al. [AKKLR05] rediscovered this test and showed that it
accepts every degree d polynomial with probability 1, while it rejects
functions that are Omega(1)-far with probability Omega(1/(d 2^{d})). We give an
asymptotically optimal analysis of this test, and show that it rejects
functions that are (even only) Omega(2^{-d})-far with Omega(1)-probability (so
the rejection probability is a universal constant independent of d and n). This
implies a tight relationship between the (d+1)st Gowers norm of a function and
its maximal correlation with degree d polynomials, when the correlation is
close to 1. Our proof works by induction on n and yields a new analysis of even
the classical Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld [BLR93] linearity test, for the setting of
functions mapping F_2^n to F_2. The optimality follows from a tighter analysis
of counterexamples to the ""inverse conjecture for the Gowers norm"" constructed
by [GT09,LMS08]. Our result has several implications. First, it shows that the
Gowers norm test is tolerant, in that it also accepts close codewords. Second,
it improves the parameters of an XOR lemma for polynomials given by Viola and
Wigderson [VW07]. Third, it implies a ""query hierarchy"" result for property
testing of affine-invariant properties. That is, for every function q(n), it
gives an affine-invariant property that is testable with O(q(n))-queries, but
not with o(q(n))-queries, complementing an analogous result of [GKNR09] for
graph properties.

the cases of scalar and spinor operators studied in \cite{Faulkner:2009wj}, the
correlators of charge (vector) current and energy-momentum (tensor) operators
exhibit scaling behavior at low frequency. The existence of such low frequency
behavior is related to the fact that the near-horizon geometry of the extremal
black hole background has an AdS_2 factor. We carefully calculate the shear
viscosity (at zero temperature) and show that the ratio of the shear viscosity
to the entropy density takes the value of 1/4\pi. Because of the AdS_2 factor,
we argue that this result stays the same for all d-dimensional boundary field
theories dual to the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom AdS_{d+1} black holes. Also,
we compute the charge conductivity at zero temperature. The limiting behavior
of the conductivity for small frequencies is also attributed to the near
horizon AdS_2 factor and is argued to hold regardless of the dimension of the

AdS_4 black hole as the background, we extract the conductivity in the presence

most celebrated manifestations is the Abrikosov vortex lattice: under an
applied magnetic field, the homogeneous superconductivity becomes unstable and
cast itself into a regular texture of the ""normal"" filaments, called Abrikosov
vortices, immersed into a superconducting matrix. Its prediction and the
experimental discovery became a breakthrough in our understanding of
superconductivity and founded a new direction in physics. Here we show that the
interplay between the superconducting order parameter and elastic fields, which
are intimately connected to the very existence of the superconductivity itself,
can result in a novel superconducting state dual to the Abrikosov state: a
regular texture of superconducting islands. The fact that both patterns emerge
within the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau description of superconductivity
indicates that the formation of regular structures may be a generic feature of
any phase transition. Emergence of superconducting island arrays is not
specific to the effect of the elastic forces, but can be caused by any inherent
mechanism generating long-range non-local interactions in the Ginzburg-Landau
functional, for example, by the Coulomb forces. In particular, our findings
suggest the formation of a superconducting island textures as a scenario for a
superconductor-to-insulator transition in thin films.

of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately,
exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of
approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large
dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the
variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have
its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We
describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by
deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP
approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a
compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we
show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we
show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix
provides a significant increase in approximation power.

homogeneity is better than 12%. The scatter in Fe we find seems to have a
dependence on luminosity, possibly due to the well-known inadequacies of
stellar atmospheres for upper-RGB stars and/or to intrinsic variability. It
also seems to be correlated with cluster properties, like the mass, indicating
a larger scatter in more massive GCs which is likely a (small) true intrinsic

coherency in the coherence resonance by blocking the destructive effect of the
noise on the system at higher noise level. This phenomenon of constant
coherence resonance (CCR) cannot be explained by the existing way of simulation
of the model equations of an excitable system with added noise. In this paper,
we have proposed a general model which explains the noise induced resonance
phenomenon CCR as well as coherence resonance (CR) and stochastic resonance
(SR). The simulation has been carried out considering the basic mechanism of
noise induced resonance phenomena: noise only perturbs the system control
parameter to excite coherent oscillations, taking proper precautions so that
the destructive effect of noise does not affect the system. In this approach,
the CR has been obtained from the interference between the system output and
noise, and the SR has been obtained by adding noise and a subthreshold signal.
This also explains the observation of the frequency shift of coherent
oscillations in the CCR with noise level.

information of two low-lying states for each parity. The two-flavor CP-PACS
gauge configurations are used, which are generated in the renormalization-group
improved gauge action and the ${\mathcal O}(a)$-improved quark action. Three
different $\beta$'s, $\beta = 1.80$, 1.95 and 2.10, are employed, whose
corresponding lattice spacings are $a = 0.2150$, 0.1555 and 0.1076 fm. For each

Results indicate that there are two negative-parity $\Lambda$ states nearly
degenerate at around 1.6 GeV, while no state as low as $\Lambda (1405)$ is
observed. By decomposing the flavor components of each state, we find that the

much longer than the prompt MeV emission has been detected from several long
duration gamma ray bursts (LGRBs) and short hard bursts (SHBs) by the Compton,
Fermi and AGILE gamma ray observatories. In this paper we show that the main
observed properties of this HE emission are those predicted by the cannonball
(CB) model of GRBs: In the CB model all the observed radiations in a GRB are
produced by the interaction of a highly relativistic jet of plasmoids (CBs)
with the environment. The prompt X-ray and MeV $\gamma$-ray pulses are produced
by inverse Compton scattering (ICS) of glory photons -photons scattered/emitted
into a cavity created by the wind/ejecta blown from the progenitor star or a
companion star long before the GRB- by the thermal electrons in the CBs. A
simultaneous optical and high energy emission begins shortly after each MeV
pulse when the CB collides with the wind/ejecta, and continues during the
deceleration of the CB in the interstellar medium. The optical emission is
dominated by synchrotron radiation (SR) from the swept-in and knocked-on
electrons which are Fermi accelerated to high energies by the turbulent
magnetic fields in the CBs, while ICS of these SR photons dominates the
emission of HE photons. The lightcurves of the optical and HE emissions have
approximately the same temporal behaviour but have different power-law spectra.
The emission of very high energy (VHE) photons above 100 TeV is dominated by
the decay of $\pi^0$'s produced in hadronic collisions of Fermi accelerated
protons in the CBs. The CB model explains well all the observed radiations,
including the high energy radiation from both LGRBs and SHBs as demonstrated
here for GRB 090902B and SHB 090510.

presented. These emission lines are fitted with composite models of broad and
narrow emission, which include combinations of classical broad-line regions of
fast-moving gas clouds lying outside the quasar nucleus, and/or a theoretical
model of emission from an optically-thick, flattened, rotating accretion disk.
All bar one of the nineteen sources are found to have emission consistent with
the presence of an optically-emitting accretion disk, with the exception
appearing to display complex emission including at least three broad
components. Ten of the quasars have strong Bayesian evidence for broad-line
emission arising from an accretion disk together with a standard broad-line
region, selected in preference to a model with two simple broad lines. Thus the
best explanation for the complexity required to fit the broad H-alpha lines in
this sample is optical emission from an accretion disk in addition to a region
of fast-moving clouds. We derive estimates of the angle between the rotation
axis of the accretion disk and the line of sight. A weak correlation is found
between the accretion disk angle and the logarithm of the low-frequency radio
luminosity. This is direct, albeit tenuous, evidence for the receding torus
model. Velocity shifts of the broad H-alpha components are analysed and the
results found to be consistent with a two-component model comprising one
single-peaked broad line emitted at the same redshift as the narrow lines, and
emission from an accretion disk which appears to be preferentially redshifted
with respect to the narrow lines for high-redshift sources and blueshifted
relative to the narrow lines for low-redshift sources.

well-matched to scaled solar residual abundances not formed by the s-process.
We also compare the observed pattern with recent high-entropy wind (HEW)
calculations, which assume core-collapse supernovae of massive stars as the
astrophysical environment for the r-process, and find good agreement for most
lanthanides. The abundance ratios of the lighter elements strontium, yttrium,

the framework of the Landau theory of phase transitions. With a revised value
of the coupling coefficient between the order parameter and the volume

reproduces satisfactorily the boundary in the phase diagram, but fails at
reflecting the more pronounced second-order character of the pressure-induced

used to constrain various DE models. But in \cite{wei10}, only the $\Lambda$CDM
model is used to select the outliers from the Union and the Constitution

the truncation procedure should be performed for each different DE model. In
the present work, by performing the truncation procedure of \cite{wei10} for 10
different models, we demonstrate that the impact of different models is
negligible, and the approach adopted in \cite{wei10} is valid. Moreover, by
using the 4 SNIa datasets mentioned above, as well as the observations of CMB

For each DE model, the truncated SNIa datasets not only greatly reduce
$\chi_{min}^{2}$ and $\chi_{min}^{2}/dof$, but also remove the tension between
SNIa data and other cosmological observations. (2) The CMB data is very helpful
to break the degeneracy among different parameters, and plays a very important
role in distinguishing different DE models. (3) The current observational data

The ratio of the energy of the interacting to the non-interacting gas for a
system of 128 particles is calculated to be 0.4517(3) in VMC and 0.4339(1) in
the more accurate DMC method. The spherically-averaged pair-correlation

active star forming regions of W51A and W51B. From the YSOs associated with
W51, we find evidence for mass segregation showing that the most massive YSOs
are concentrated on the W51 HII region complex. We find a variation in the
spatial distribution of the mass function (MF) of YSOs in the mass range
between 5 Msun and 18 Msun. The derived slopes of the MF are -1.26 and -2.36 in
the active star-forming region and the outer region, respectively. The
variation of the MF for YSOs embedded in the molecular cloud implies that the
distribution of stellar masses in clusters depends on the local conditions in

over a wide range of scales. Which are the mechanical and dynamic properties
that evolution has optimized by choosing self-similarity? How can we describe
the mechanics of self-similar structures in the static and dynamic framework?
Physical systems with self-similarity as a symmetry property require the
introduction of non-local particle-particle interactions and a (quasi-)
continuous distribution of mass. We construct self-similar functions and linear
operators such as a self-similar variant of the Laplacian and of the
D'Alembertian wave operator. The obtained self-similar linear wave equation
describes the dynamics of a quasi-continuous linear chain of infinite length
with a spatially self-similar distribution of nonlocal inter-particle springs.
The self-similarity of the nonlocal harmonic particle-particle interactions
results in a dispersion relation of the form of a Weierstrass-Mandelbrot
function which exhibits self-similar and fractal features. We deduce a
continuum approximation that links the self-similar Laplacian to fractional
integrals and which yields in the low-frequency regime a power law frequency
dependence for the oscillator density. For details of the present model we
refer to our recent paper (Michelitsch et al., Phys. Rev. E 80, 011135 (2009)).

scatters off the hole, a phenomena known as superradiant scattering. If in
addition the field has a non-zero rest mass then the mass term effectively
works as a mirror, reflecting the scattered wave back towards the black hole.
In this physical system, known as a black-hole bomb, the wave may bounce back
and forth between the black hole and some turning point amplifying itself each
time. Consequently, the massive field grows exponentially over time and is
unstable. Former analytical estimations of the timescale associated with the
instability were restricted to the regimes $M\mu>>1$ and $M\mu<<1$, where $M$
and $\mu$ are the masses of the black hole and the field, respectively. In
these two limits the growth rate of the field was found to be extremely weak.
However, subsequent numerical investigations have indicated that the
instability is actually greatest in the regime $M\mu=O(1)$, where the previous
analytical approximations break down. Thus, a new analytical study of the
instability timescale for the case $M\mu=O(1)$ is physically well motivated. In
this Letter we study analytically for the first time the phenomena of
superradiant instability (the black-hole bomb mechanism) in this physically
interesting regime -- the regime of greatest instability. We find an
instability growth rate of $\tau^{-1}=\omega_I=1.7\times 10^{-3}M^{-1}$ for the
fastest growing mode. This instability is four orders of magnitude stronger

  The merit of estimating the null distribution is examined from the vantage
point of conditional inference in the remainder of the paper. In a simulation
study of genome-scale multiple testing, conditioning the observed confidence
level on the estimated null distribution as an approximate ancillary statistic
markedly improved conditional inference. To enable researchers to determine
whether to rely on a particular estimated null distribution for inference or
decision making, an information-theoretic score is provided that quantifies the
benefit of conditioning. As the sum of the degree of ancillarity and the degree
of inferential relevance, the score reflects the balance conditioning would

specification language which supports the concise and direct description of
formal systems, a mechanism for animating the specification language thereby
producing prototypes of encoded systems, and a logic for proving properties of
specifications and therefore of the systems they encode. A defining
characteristic of the proposed framework is that it is based on two separate
but closely intertwined logics: a specification logic that facilitates the
description of computational structure and another logic that exploits the
special characteristics of the specification logic to support reasoning about
the computational behavior of systems that are described using it. Both logics
embody a natural treatment of binding structure by using the lambda-calculus as
a means for representing objects and by incorporating special mechanisms for
working with such structure. By using this technique, they lift the treatment
of binding from the object language into the domain of the relevant meta logic,
thereby allowing the specification or analysis components to focus on the more
essential logical aspects of the systems that are encoded. The primary
contributions of these thesis are the development of a rich meta-logic called G
with capabilities for sophisticated reasoning that includes induction and
co-induction over high-level specifications of computations and with an
associated cut-elimination result; an interactive reasoning system called
Abella based on G; and several reasoning examples which demonstrate the
expressiveness and naturalness of both G and Abella.

discuss what it would take for higher multiplicity arms to form. We show that
the shapes of observed and theoretical spirals agree and we predict that
stronger non-axisymmetric forcings at and somewhat beyond corotation will drive
more open spirals. We compare the ratio of ring diameters in theory and in
observations and predict that more elliptical rings will correspond to stronger
forcings. We find that the model potential may influence strongly the numerical

Any dark matter annihilation model proposed to explain these data must also
explain the fact that PAMELA data show excesses only in $e^\pm$ spectrum but
not in anti-proton. It is interesting to ask whether the annihilation mode into
anti-proton is completely disallowed or only suppressed at low energies. Most
models proposed have negligible anti-protons in all energy ranges. We show that
the leptocentric $U(1)_{B-3L_i}$ dark matter model can explain the $e^\pm$

shown that the Coulomb mechanism reduces to long-range dipole-dipole energy
transfer from photoexcited quantum dots to Mn$^{2+}$ ions. The recombination
due to the Coulomb mechanism is allowed for any states of Mn$^{2+}$ ions and
{\it e-h} complexes. In contrast, short-range exchange and ${\it sp-d}$

strong {\it lh-hh} splitting of hole states in quantum dots. Estimates show
that efficiency of the {\it sp-d} mechanism can considerably exceed that of the

the direct power-law component, its reflection component, two warm absorbers
with different ionization states, and neutral absorption. We have taken two
approaches to study its spectral variation at various timescales: The first
approach is to make intensity-sliced spectra and study correlation between the
intensity and spectral shape. The second approach is to study spectral changes
between the intervals when the source flux is above (""bright state"") and below
(""faint state"") the average for fixed time-intervals. In both approaches, we
found a clear correlation between the intensity in the 6 -- 10 keV band and the
spectral ratio of 0.5 -- 3.0 keV/6.0-- 10 keV. Such a spectral variation
requires change of the apparent slope of the direct component, whereas the
shape and intensity of the reflection component being invariable. The observed
apparent spectral change is explained by variation of the ionization degree of
one of the two warm absorbers due to intrinsic source luminosity variation.
Current results suggest that the warm absorber has a critical role to explain
the observed continuum spectral shape and variation of MCG-6-30-15, which is
essential to constrain parameters of the putatively broadened iron line

Spitzer infrared imaging of 8 nearby galaxies, and examined the properties of
individual UV and 24 micron selected star forming regions. We concentrated on
star-forming regions, in order to isolate simpler star formation histories than
those that characterize whole galaxies. We find that 1) the dispersion is not
correlated with the mean age of the stellar populations, 2) a range of dust
geometries and dust extinction curves are the most likely causes for the
observed dispersion in the IRX-beta diagram 3) together with some potential
dilution of the most recent star-forming population by older unrelated bursts,
at least in the case of star-forming regions within galaxies, 4) we also
recover some general characteristics of the regions, including a tight positive
correlation between the amount of dust attenuation and the metal content.
Although generalizing our results to whole galaxies may not be immediate, the
possibility of a range of dust extinction laws and geometries should be
accounted for in the latter systems as well.

obtained average B.R. value was approximately twice the theoretical value
calculated earlier within the framework of the standard electroweak model.

deduce that based on this finding a deviation from the standard model has been
observed. To prove or disprove the existence of a deviation it is necessary to
conduct a new experiment that would allow to measure the radiative peak in
timing spectra with precision in the order of 1%. By the present time we have
prepared a new experiment the main result of which would be the measurement of
B.R. for the radiative branch of neutron decay with this precision.

bounding the region of first order chiral phase transitions for small quark

endpoint of the QCD (T,\mu)-phase diagram is widely expected to be part of this
surface. Since for \mu=0 with physical quark masses QCD is known to exhibit an
analytic crossover, this expectation requires the region of chiral transitions
to expand with \mu for a chiral critical endpoint to exist. Instead, on coarse
N_t=4 lattices, we find the area of chiral transitions to shrink with \mu,
which excludes a chiral critical point for QCD at moderate chemical potentials
\mu_B < 500 MeV. First results on finer N_t=6 lattices indicate a curvature of

locations along the filament, which suggest plasma motions along twisted flux
rope. THEMIS and GONG observations show shearing photospheric motions leading
to magnetic flux canceling around barbs. STEREO A, B spacecraft with separation

filament disappears by becoming optically thin to undetectable levels. No CME
was detected by STEREO, only a faint CME was recorded by LASCO at the beginning
of the disappearance phase at 02:00 UT, which could be due to partial filament
eruption. Further, STEREO Fe XII 195 \AA\ images showed bright loops beneath

deduce an hydrodynamical equation formally similar to the one obtained for a
perfect fluid in a Universe obeying the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric.

polarizability operator and the self-energy operator through a set of linear

validate our approach by calculating the vertical ionization energies of the
benzene molecule and then show its potential by addressing the spectrum of a
large molecule such as free-base tetraphenylporphyrin.

properties of single-band Anderson impurity problem (SIAM). In our approach a
series expansion is constructed in vertices of the corresponding atomic
Hamiltonian problem. This expansion contains a small parameter in two limiting
cases: in the weak coupling case ($U/t \to 0$), due to the smallness of the
irreducible vertices, and near the atomic limit ($U/t \to \infty$), when bare
propagators are small. Reasonable results are obtained also for the most
interesting case of strong correlations ($U \approx t$). The atomic problem of
the Anderson impurity model has a degenerate ground state, so the application
of the perturbation theory is not straightforward. We construct a special
approach dealing with symmetry-broken ground state of the renormalized atomic
problem. Formulae for the first-order dual diagram correction are obtained
analytically in the real-time domain. Most of the Kondo-physics is reproduced:
logarithmic contributions to the self energy arise, Kondo-like peak at the
Fermi level appears, and the Friedel sum rule is fulfilled. Our approach
describes also renormalization of atomic resonances due to hybridization with a
conduction band. A generalization of the proposed scheme to a multi-orbital
case can be important for the realistic description of correlated solids.
