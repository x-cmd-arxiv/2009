optical) fluxes of 14 newly WFC3/IR-detected z=7 z_{850}-dropout galaxies and 5
z=8 Y_{105}-dropout galaxies. The WFC3/IR depth and spatial resolution allow
accurate removal of contaminating foreground light, enabling reliable flux
measurements at 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron. None of the galaxies are detected to
[3.6]=26.9 (AB, 2 sigma), but a stacking analysis reveals a robust detection
for the z_{850}-dropouts and an upper limit for the Y_{105}-dropouts. We
construct average broadband SEDs using the stacked ACS, WFC3, and IRAC fluxes
and fit stellar population synthesis models to derive mean redshifts, stellar
masses, and ages. For the z_{850}-dropouts, we find z=6.9^{+0.1}_{-0.1},
(U-V)_{rest}=0.4, reddening A_V=0, stellar mass M*=1.2^{+0.3}_{-0.6} x 10^9
M_sun (Salpeter IMF). The best-fit ages ~300Myr, M/L_V=0.2, and
SSFR=1.7Gyr^{-1} are similar to values reported for luminous z=7 galaxies,
indicating the galaxies are smaller but not younger. The sub-L* galaxies
observed here contribute significantly to the stellar mass density and under
favorable conditions may have provided enough photons for sustained
reionization at 7<z<11. In contrast, the z=8.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2} Y_{105}-dropouts
have stellar masses that are uncertain by 1.5 dex due to the near-complete
reliance on far-UV data. Adopting the 2 sigma upper limit on the M/L(z=8), the
stellar mass density to M_{UV,AB} < -18 declines from
rho*(z=7)=3.7^{+1.0}_{-1.8} x 10^6 M_sun Mpc^{-3} to rho*(z=8) < 8 x 10^5 M_sun

more dramatic evolution, which can be established with deeper IRAC

permutations (or, the symmetric group) over $n$ elements from given partial

theoretic Fourier Transform of the function. This problem naturally arises in
several settings such as ranked elections, multi-object tracking, ranking
systems, and recommendation systems. Inspired by the work of Donoho and Stark
in the context of discrete-time functions, we focus on non-negative functions
with a sparse support (support size $\ll$ domain size). Our recovery method is
based on finding the sparsest solution (through $\ell_0$ optimization) that is
consistent with the available information. As the main result, we derive
sufficient conditions for functions that can be recovered exactly from partial
information through $\ell_0$ optimization. Under a natural random model for the
generation of functions, we quantify the recoverability conditions by deriving
bounds on the sparsity (support size) for which the function satisfies the
sufficient conditions with a high probability as $n \to \infty$. $\ell_0$
optimization is computationally hard. Therefore, the popular compressive
sensing literature considers solving the convex relaxation, $\ell_1$
optimization, to find the sparsest solution. However, we show that $\ell_1$
optimization fails to recover a function (even with constant sparsity)
generated using the random model with a high probability as $n \to \infty$. In
order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel iterative algorithm for the
recovery of functions that satisfy the sufficient conditions. Finally, using an
Information Theoretic framework, we study necessary conditions for exact
recovery to be possible.

intense radio synchrotron emission in its shell and known to be interacting
with a molecular cloud. The gamma-ray emission is spatially extended, broadly
consistent with the radio and X-ray extent of SNR W51C. The energy spectrum in
the 0.2-50 GeV band exhibits steepening toward high energies. The luminosity is
greater than 1x10^{36} erg/s given the distance constraint of D>5.5 kpc, which
makes this object one of the most luminous gamma-ray sources in our Galaxy. The
observed gamma-rays can be explained reasonably by a combination of efficient
acceleration of nuclear cosmic rays at supernova shocks and shock-cloud
interactions. The decay of neutral pi-mesons produced in hadronic collisions
provides a plausible explanation for the gamma-ray emission. The product of the
average gas density and the total energy content of the accelerated protons
amounts to 5x10^{51}(D/6kpc)^2 erg/cm^3. Electron density constraints from the
radio and X-ray bands render it difficult to explain the LAT signal as due to
inverse Compton scattering. The Fermi LAT source coincident with SNR W51C sheds

calculations of structure in the Universe, i.e., how to go beyond the
pressureless fluid approximation, starting from first principles. This
addresses a possible deficiency in uses of PT to compute clustering on the
weakly non-linear scales that will be critical for probing dark energy.
Specifically, I show how to derive a non-negligible value for the (initially
tiny) velocity dispersion of dark matter particles, <\delta v^2>, where \delta
v is the deviation of particle velocities from the local bulk flow. The
calculation is essentially a renormalization of the homogeneous (zero order)
dispersion by fluctuations 1st order in the initial power spectrum. For power
law power spectra with n>-3, the small-scale fluctuations diverge and
significant dispersion can be generated from an arbitrarily small starting
value -- the dispersion level is set by an equilibrium between fluctuations
generating more dispersion and dispersion suppressing fluctuations. For an
n=-1.4 power law normalized to match the present non-linear scale, the
dispersion would be ~100 km/s. This n corresponds roughly to the slope on the
non-linear scale in the real \LambdaCDM Universe, but \LambdaCDM contains much
less initial small-scale power -- not enough to bootstrap the small starting
dispersion up to a significant value within linear theory (viewed very broadly,
structure formation has actually taken place rather suddenly and recently, in
spite of the usual ""hierarchical"" description). The next order PT calculation,
which I carry out only at an order of magnitude level, should drive the
dispersion up into balance with the growing structure, accounting for small
dispersion effects seen recently in simulations.

bivariate mass-age distribution g(M,\tau). In particular, we derive formulae
for g(M,\tau) for two idealized models in which the rate of disruption depends
on the masses of the clusters and one in which it does not. We then compare
these models with our Hubble Space Telescope observations of star clusters in
the Antennae galaxies over the mass-age domain in which we can readily
distinguish clusters from individual stars: \tau\la10^7(M/10^4 M_{\odot})^{1.3}
yr. We find that the models with mass-dependent disruption are poor fits to the
data, even with complete freedom to adjust several parameters, while the model
with mass-independent disruption is a good fit. The successful model has the
simple form g(M,\tau) \propto M^{-2} \tau^{-1}, with power-law mass and age
distributions, dN/dM propto M^{-2} and dN/d\tau\propto\tau^{-1}. The predicted
luminosity function is also a power law, dN/dL \propto L^{-2}, in good
agreement with our observations of the Antennae clusters. The similarity of the
mass functions of star clusters and molecular clouds indicates that the
efficiency of star formation in the clouds is roughly independent of their
masses. The age distribution of the massive young clusters is plausibly
explained by the following combination of disruption mechanisms: (1) removal of
interstellar material by stellar feedback, \tau \la 10^7$ yr; (2) continued
stellar mass loss, 10^7 yr \la \tau \la 10^8 yr; (3), tidal disturbances by
passing molecular clouds, \tau \ga 10^8 yr. None of these processes is expected
to have a strong dependence on mass, consistent with our observations of the
Antennae clusters. We speculate that this simple picture also applies--at least
approximately--to the clusters in many other galaxies.

argue that the X-ray emission comes from collisionally ionized material,
originally cold gas that has been shock-heated by the passage of the radio jet,
rather than being photoionized by nuclear radiation. This hot plasma is also
responsible for the depolarization at low frequencies of the radio emission
from the jet and hotspots, which allows us to estimate the magnetic field
strength in the external medium. We show that it is likely that both the cold
emission-line gas and the hot plasma in which it is embedded are being driven
out of the host galaxy of 3C171 at supersonic speeds. A significant fraction of
the total energy budget of the central AGN must have been expended in driving
this massive outflow. We argue that 3C171, with its unusual radio morphology
and the strong relation between the jet and large amounts of outflowing
material, is a member of a class of radio galaxies in which there is strong
interaction between the radio jets and cold material in the host galaxy; such
objects may have been very much more common in the early universe.

temperature-dependent axion mass. The latter has recently been determined
within the interacting instanton liquid model (IILM), and provides for the
first time a well-motivated axion mass for all temperatures. We reexamine the
constraints placed on the axion parameter space in the light of this new mass
function. We find an accurate and updated constraint $ f_a \le 2.8(\pm2)\times
10^{11}\units{GeV}$ or $m_a \ge 21(\pm2) \units{\mu eV}$ from the misalignment
mechanism in the classic axion window (thermal scenario). However, this is
superseded by axion string radiation which leads to $ f_a \lesssim
3.2^{+4}_{-2} \times 10^{10} \units{GeV}$ or $m_a \gtrsim 0.20 ^{+0.2}_{-0.1}
\units{meV}$. In this analysis, we take care to precisely compute the effective
degrees of freedom and, to fill a gap in the literature, we present accurate
fitting formulas. We solve the evolution equations exactly, and find that
analytic results used to date generally underestimate the full numerical
solution by a factor 2-3. In the inflationary scenario, axions induce
isocurvature fluctuations and constrain the allowed inflationary scale $H_I$.
Taking anharmonic effects into account, we show that these bounds are actually
weaker than previously computed. Considering the fine-tuning issue of the
misalignment angle in the whole of the anthropic window, we derive new bounds
which open up the inflationary window near $\theta_a \to \pi$. In particular,
we find that inflationary dark matter axions can have masses as high as
0.01--1$\units{meV}$, covering the whole thermal axion range, with values of
$H_I$ up to $10^9$GeV. Quantum fluctuations during inflation exclude dominant
dark matter axions with masses above $m_a\lesssim 1$meV.

between alternative stable states (ASS) in ecosystems which, quite often, are
not smooth but abrupt or catastrophic. Early warnings of such catastrophic
regime shifts are fundamental for designing management protocols for
ecosystems. Here we study the spatial version of a popular ecological model,
involving a logistically growing single species subject to exploitation, which
is known to exhibit ASS. Spatial heterogeneity is introduced by a carrying
capacity parameter varying from cell to cell in a regular lattice. Transport of
biomass among cells is included in the form of diffusion. We investigate
whether different quantities from statistical mechanics -like the variance, the
two-point correlation function and the patchiness- may serve as early warnings
of catastrophic phase transitions between the ASS. In particular, we find that
the patch-size distribution follows a power law when the system is close to the
catastrophic transition. We also provide links between spatial and temporal
indicators and analyze how the interplay between diffusion and spatial
heterogeneity may affect the earliness of each of the observables. We find that
possible remedial procedures, which can be followed after these early signals,
are more effective as the diffusion becomes lower. Finally, we comment on
similarities and differences between these catastrophic shifts and paradigmatic
thermodynamic phase transitions like the liquid-vapour change of state for a
fluid like water.

$Q_0\sqcup Q_1$. The involution allows us to define a nondegenerate bilinear
form $<,>$ on a representation $V$ of $Q$. We shall call the representation
orthogonal if $<,>$ is symmetric and symplectic if $<,>$ is skew-symmetric.
Moreover we can define an action of products of classical groups on the space
of orthogonal representations and on the space of symplectic representations.
For symmetric quivers of finite type, we prove that the rings of
semi-invariants for this action are spanned by the semi-invariants of
determinantal type $c^V$ and, in the case when matrix defining $c^V$ is
skew-symmetric, by the Pfaffians $pf^V$.

an important acceleration mechanism in a variety of astrophysical objects
including extragalactic jets in active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts.
These sources remain strong and interesting candidate sites for the generation
of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. In this paper, key predictions of DSA at
relativistic shocks that are salient to the issue of cosmic ray ion and
electron production are outlined. Results from a Monte Carlo simulation of such
diffusive acceleration in test-particle, relativistic, oblique, MHD shocks are
presented. Simulation output is described for both large angle and small angle
scattering scenarios, and a variety of shock obliquities including superluminal
regimes when the de Hoffman-Teller frame does not exist. The distribution
function power-law indices compare favorably with results from other
techniques. They are found to depend sensitively on the mean magnetic field
orientation in the shock, and the nature of MHD turbulence that propagates
along fields in shock environs. An interesting regime of flat spectrum
generation is addressed, providing evidence for its origin being due to shock
drift acceleration. The impact of these theoretical results on gamma-ray burst
and blazar science is outlined. Specifically, Fermi gamma-ray observations of
these cosmic sources are already providing significant constraints on important
environmental quantities for relativistic shocks, namely the frequency of
scattering and the level of field turbulence.

time delay from the laser pulse using a short-duration, millimetre-wave pulse
that is resonant with a one- or two-photon transition. We then selectively
field ionize the monitor state, and detect the resulting electrons with a
micro-channel plate. This signal is an accurate mirror of the target state
population, and is uncontaminated by contributions from other states which are
populated by black body radiation. Our results are generally consistent with
other recent experimental results obtained using a less sensitive method, and
are also in excellent agreement with theory.

with material processed by hydrogen burning. Two main sources have been
suggested: asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars rotating near
the break-up limit (spin stars). We propose massive binaries as an alternative
source.
  We compute the evolution of a 20 Msun star in a close binary and find that it
sheds about 10 Msun. The ejecta are enriched in He, N, Na, and Al and depleted
in C and O, similar to the abundance patterns observed in gobular cluster
stars. In contrast to the fast, radiatively driven winds of massive stars, this
material is typically ejected with low velocity. We expect that it remains
inside the potential well of a globular cluster and becomes available for the
formation or pollution of a second generation of stars.
  We estimate that the amount of processed low-velocity material ejected by
massive binaries is greater than the contribution of AGB stars and spin stars
combined, assuming that the majority of massive stars in a proto-globular
cluster interact. If we take the possible contribution of intermediate mass
stars in binaries into account and assume that the ejecta are diluted with an
equal amount of unprocessed material, we find that this scenario can provide
enough material to form a second generation of low-mass stars, which is as
numerous as the first generation of low-mass stars. In this scenario there is
no need to make commonly adopted assumptions, such as preferential loss of the
first generation of stars, external pollution of the cluster, or an anomalous
initial mass function. [Abridged]

form in star clusters of different masses. This nature of clustered star
formation is taken into account in the theory of the integrated galactic
stellar initial mass function (IGIMF) in which the galaxy-wide IMF (the IGIMF)
is calculated by adding all IMFs of young star clusters. For massive stars the
IGIMF is steeper than the universal IMF in star clusters and steepens with
decreasing SFR which is called the IGIMF-effect. The current SFR and the total
Halpha luminosity of galaxies therefore scale non-linearly in the IGIMF theory
compared to the classical case in which the galaxy-wide IMF is assumed to be
constant and identical to the IMF in star clusters. We here apply for the first
time the revised SFR-L_Halpha relation on a sample of local volume star forming
galaxies with measured Halpha luminosities. The fundamental results are: i) the
SFRs of galaxies scale linearly with the total galaxy neutral gas mass, ii) the
gas depletion time scales of dwarf irregular and large disk galaxies are about
3 Gyr implying that dwarf galaxies do not have lower star formation
efficiencies than large disk galaxies, and iii) the stellar mass buildup times
of dwarf and large galaxies are only in agreement with downsizing in the IGIMF
context, but contradict downsizing within the traditional framework that
assumes a constant galaxy-wide IMF.

luminosities in distant galaxies, a lynchpin of modern astronomy. We use data
from the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimetre Telescope (BLAST), Spitzer,
the Large Apex BOlometer CamerA (LABOCA), the Very Large Array (VLA) and the
Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in the Extended Chandra Deep Field
South (ECDFS). For a catalogue of BLAST 250-micron-selected galaxies, we
re-measure the 70--870-micron flux densities at the positions of their most
likely 24-micron counterparts, which have a median [interquartile] redshift of
0.74 [0.25, 1.57]. From these, we determine the monochromatic flux density
ratio, q_250 = log_10 (S_250micron / S_1400MHz), and the bolometric equivalent,
q_IR. At z ~= 0.6, where our 250-micron filter probes rest-frame 160-micron
emission, we find no evolution relative to q_160 for local galaxies. We also
stack the FIR and submm images at the positions of 24-micron- and
radio-selected galaxies. The difference between q_IR seen for 250-micron- and
radio-selected galaxies suggests star formation provides most of the IR
luminosity in ~< 100-uJy radio galaxies, but rather less for those in the mJy
regime. For the 24-micron sample, the radio spectral index is constant across 0
< z < 3, but q_IR exhibits tentative evidence of a steady decline such that
q_IR is proportional to (1+z)^(-0.15 +/- 0.03) - significant evolution,
spanning the epoch of galaxy formation, with major implications for techniques
that rely on the FIR/radio correlation. We compare with model predictions and
speculate that we may be seeing the increase in radio activity that gives rise
to the radio background.

morphological type in the SDSS. We also quantify how estimates of the fraction
of `early' or `late' type galaxies depend on whether the samples were cut in
color, concentration or light profile shape, and compare with similar estimates
based on morphology. Our fits show that Es account for about 20% of the r-band
luminosity density, rho_Lr, and 25% of the stellar mass density, rho_*;
including S0s and Sas increases these numbers to 33% and 40%, and 50% and 60%,

Mpc^{-3} at z ~ 0. This is in good agreement with expectations based on
integrating the star formation history. However, compared to most previous
work, we find an excess of objects at large masses, up to a factor of ~ 10 at
M_* ~ 5*10^{11} M_Sun. The stellar mass density further increases at large
masses if we assume different IMFs for Es and spiral galaxies, as suggested by
some recent chemical evolution models, and results in a better agreement with
the dynamical mass function. We also show that the trend for ellipticity to
decrease with luminosity is primarily because the E/S0 ratio increases at large
L. However, the most massive galaxies, M_* > 5 * 10^{11} M_Sun, are less
concentrated and not as round as expected if one extrapolates from lower L, and
they are not well-fit by pure deVaucouleur laws. This suggests formation
histories with recent radial mergers. Finally, we show that the age-size
relation is flat for Es of fixed dynamical mass, but, at fixed M_dyn, S0s and
Sas with large sizes tend to be younger. Explaining this difference between E
and S0 formation is a new challenge for models of early-type galaxy formation.

statistical detection of <S_1.2mm>= 0.96+-0.11 mJy and stacking only the
non-detections also yields a statistical detection, with <S_1.2mm>= 0.51+-0.13
mJy. This corresponds to a typical far-infrared luminosity L_FIR~4x10^12 Lsol.
If the far-infrared luminosity is powered entirely by star-formation, and not
by AGN-heated dust, then the characteristic inferred star-formation rate is
~700 Msol yr-1. This far-infrared luminosity implies a dust mass of
M_dust~3x10^8 Msol. We estimate that such large dust masses on kpc scales can
plausibly cause the obscuration of the quasars. We present dust SEDs for our
sample and derive a mean SED for our sample. This mean SED is not well fitted
by clumpy torus models, unless additional extinction and far-infrared
re-emission due to cool dust are included. There is a hint that the host
galaxies of obscured quasars must have higher far-infrared luminosities and
cool-dust masses and are therefore often found at an earlier evolutionary phase
than those of unobscured quasars. For one source at z=2.767, we detect the
CO(3-2) transition, with S_CO Delta nu=630+-50 mJy km s-1, corresponding to

of all dimension-five and dimension-six effective operators and their
associated supersymmetry breaking terms. The corrections to the masses of the
neutral CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons due to the d=5 and d=6 operators are
computed. When the d=5 and d=6 operators are generated by the same physics
(i.e. when suppressed by powers of the same scale M), due to the relative
$\tan\beta$ enhancement of the latter, which compensates their extra scale
suppression (1/M), the mass corrections from d=6 operators can be comparable to
those of d=5 operators, even for conservative values of the scale M. We
identify the effective operators with the largest individual corrections to the
lightest Higgs mass and discuss whether at the microscopic level and in the
simplest cases, these operators are generated by ""new physics"" with a sign
consistent with an increase of m_h. Simple numerical estimates easily allow an
increase of m_h due to d=6 operators alone in the region of 10-30 GeV, while
for a much larger increase light new states beyond MSSM may be needed, in which
case the effective description is unreliable. Special attention is paid to the
treatment of the effective operators with higher derivatives. These can be
removed by non-linear field redefinitions or by an ""unfolding"" technique, which
effectively ensure that any ghost degrees of freedom (of mass $\geqsim M$) are
integrated out and absent in the effective theory at scales much smaller than
M. Considering general coefficients of the susy operators with a scale of new
physics above the LHC reach, it is possible to increase the tree-level
prediction for the Higgs mass to the LEPII bound, thus alleviating the MSSM

multifunctional La2NiMnO6. Three types of films with different levels of
structural order, including long-range Ni/Mn cation order, cation disorder, and
an admixture of the ordered and disordered phases, are compared by polarized
micro-Raman spectroscopy and magnetometry. Each film displays a strong
dependence on the polarization configuration and a unique set of Raman active
phonon excitations. Long-range cation ordering results in the splitting of
Raman active phonon peaks because of Brillouin zone folding and lowering
symmetry. Phonon mode softening begins clearly at a distinct temperature for
each sample revealing a strong spin-lattice interaction. It follows closely the
magnetization curve in ordered films. Unlike the admixture and the ordered
films, softening behavior is strongly suppressed in the cation-disordered
films. These differences may be understood based on the variation in amplitude
of the spin-spin correlation functions due to the local Ni/Mn cation ordering.

4593. The narrow Fe K alpha emission line has a FWHM width ~4000 km/s,
indicating emission from >~ 5000 Rg. There is no evidence for a
relativistically broadened Fe K line, consistent with the presence of a
radiatively efficient outer disk which is truncated or transitions to an
interior radiatively inefficient flow. The Suzaku observation caught the source
in a low-flux state; compared to a 2002 XMM observation, the hard X-ray flux
decreased by 3.6, while the Fe K alpha line intensity and width each roughly
halved. Two model-dependent explanations for the changes in Fe line profile are
explored. In one, the Fe line width has decreased from ~10000 to ~4000 km/s
from 2002 to 2007, suggesting that the thin disk truncation/transition radius
has increased from 1000-2000 to >~5000 Rg. However, there are indications from
other compact accreting systems that such truncation radii tend to be
associated only with accretion rates relative to Eddington much lower than that
of NGC 4593. In the second (preferred) model, the line profile in the XMM
observation consists of a time-invariant narrow component plus a broad
component originating from the inner part of the truncated disk (~300 Rg) which
has responded to the drop in continuum flux. The Compton reflection component
strength R is ~1.1, consistent with the measured Fe K alpha line total EQW with
an Fe abundance 1.7 times solar. The modest soft excess has fallen by a factor
of ~20 from 2002 to 2007, ruling out emission from a region 5 lt-yr in size.

presence of turbulence depends on whether magnetic fields can change their
topology via reconnection in highly conducting media. Recent progress in
understanding fast magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence is
reassuring that the magnetic field behavior in computer simulations and
turbulent astrophysical environments is similar, as far as magnetic
reconnection is concerned. Our studies of magnetic field diffusion in turbulent
medium reveal interesting new phenomena. In the presence of gravity and
turbulence, our 3D simulations show the decrease of the magnetic flux-to-mass
ratio as the gaseous density at the center of the gravitational potential
increases. We observe this effect both in the situations when we start with
equilibrium distributions of gas and magnetic field and when we follow the
evolution of collapsing dynamically unstable configurations. Thus the process
of turbulent magnetic field removal should be applicable both to quasi-static
subcritical molecular clouds and cores and violently collapsing supercritical
entities. The increase of the gravitational potential as well as the
magnetization of the gas increases the segregation of the mass and magnetic
flux in the saturated final state of the simulations, supporting the notion
that the reconnection-enabled diffusivity relaxes the magnetic field + gas
system in the gravitational field to its minimal energy state. This effect is
expected to play an important role in star formation, from its initial stages
of concentrating interstellar gas to the final stages of the accretion to the
forming protostar.

entangling gate and to quantify the decoherence mechanisms affecting the gate
performance. In addition to demonstrating a promising fidelity, our entangling
gate has a on/off ratio of 300, a level of adjustable coupling that will become
a requirement for future high-fidelity devices. This is the first solid-state
demonstration of QPT in a two-qubit system, as solid-state process tomography

FTK solves the combinatorial challenge inherent to tracking by exploiting the
massive parallelism of Associative Memories (AM) that can compare inner
detector hits to millions of pre-calculated patterns simultaneously. The
tracking problem within matched patterns is further simplified by using
pre-computed linearized fitting constants and leveraging fast DSP's in modern
commercial FPGA's. Overall, FTK is able to compute the helix parameters for all
tracks in an event and apply quality cuts in approximately one millisecond. By
employing a pipelined architecture, FTK is able to continuously operate at
Level-1 rates without deadtime. The system design is defined and studied using
ATLAS full simulation. Reconstruction quality is evaluated for single muon
events with zero pileup, as well as WH events at the LHC design luminosity. FTK
results are compared with the tracking capability of an offline algorithm.

weak hyperon-nucleon decay process is described through the independent

by the two nucleons leaving the residual nucleus is included, we have in
addition to the $2p1h$ primary configuration $2p'1h'$, $3p2h$, $4p3h$,
$\cdots$, etc secondary ones. We work within the $2p'1h'$ subspace of final
states assuming a simple approach for finite nuclei based on the eikonal
approximation. An optical potential including the nucleon-nucleus isoscalar and
isovector interaction is introduced to take into account the minimum nuclear
medium effects and to describe the nucleon-nucleus dispersion process along the
outgoing path. We applied the proposed description to the calculation of the
observables in $^{5}_\Lambda He$ and $^{12}_\Lambda C$ nonmesonic decays. The
calculated results show that our treatment of FSI even considered as restricted
to a subspace of states gives a good agreement with experimental data, similar
to that ones presented by more elaborated evaluations. This indicates that the
developed theoretical scheme seems to be appropriated to include more complex
configurations. We also discuss the ground state normalization effects at the

fields out of equilibrium in the one-loop approximation. The fields consist of
classical background fields, taken constant in space, and quantum fluctuations.
If the initial state is the adiabatic vacuum, i.e., the ground state of a Fock
space of particle excitations that diagonalize the mass matrix, the
energy-momentum tensor is infinite at t=0, its most singular part behaves as
1/t. When the system is coupled to gravity this presents a problem that we
solve by a Bogoliubov transformation of the naive initial state. As a side
result we also discuss the canonical formalism and the adiabatic particle
number for such a system. Most of the formalism is presented for Minkowksi
space. Embedding the system and its dynamics into a flat FRW universe is
straightforward and we briefly address the essential modifications.

that the lensing is caused by a group of galaxies. In this paper, new optical
imaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of B2108+213 and the
surrounding field galaxies are presented. These data are used to investigate
the mass and composition of the lensing structure. The redshift and stellar
velocity dispersion of the main lensing galaxy (G1) are found to be z = 0.3648
+/- 0.0002 and sigma_v = 325 +/- 25 km/s, respectively. The optical spectrum of
the lensed quasar shows no obvious emission or absorption features and is
consistent with a BL Lac type radio source. However, the tentative detection of
the G-band and Mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the host
galaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67.
Spectroscopy of the field around B2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similar
redshift to G1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~
0.365 associated with this system. The width of the group velocity distribution
is 694 +/- 93 km/s, but is non-Gaussian, implying that the structure is not yet
viralized. The main lensing galaxy is also the brightest group member and has a
surface brightness profile consistent with a typical cD galaxy. A lensing and
dynamics analysis of the mass distribution, which also includes the newly found
group members, finds that the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile is
on average isothermal inside the Einstein radius, but steeper at the location
of the Einstein radius. This apparent change in slope can be accounted for if
an external convergence gradient, representing the underlying parent halo of
the galaxy group, is included in the mass model.

expected from CCDs in the visual and near-infrared, this instrument can achieve
precision similar to that of the ESO NTT infrared parallax program. Therefore,
measuring parallaxes in the infrared would be feasible using this equipment. If

photometric redshift estimates at z<1.2 with a rest-frame UV colour
pre-selection approach at higher redshifts to avoid biases associated with
catastrophic failure of the photometric redshifts. Only robust optical
counterparts to X-ray sources are considered using a likelihood ratio matching
technique. A Bayesian methodology is developed that considers redshift
probability distributions, incorporates selection functions for our high
redshift samples, and allows robust comparison of different evolutionary
models. We find that the XLF retains the same shape at all redshifts, but
undergoes strong luminosity evolution out to z~1, and an overall negative
density evolution with increasing redshift, which thus dominates the evolution
at earlier times. We do not find evidence that a Luminosity-Dependent Density
Evolution, and the associated flattening of the faint-end slope, is required to
describe the evolution of the XLF. We find significantly higher space densities
of low-luminosity, high-redshift AGN than in prior studies, and a smaller shift
in the peak of the number density to lower redshifts with decreasing
luminosity. The total luminosity density of AGN peaks at z=1.2+/-0.1, but there

species in enzyme-catalysed reactions. This study is stimulated by claims that
the observed magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects
imply that quantum tunneling below the energy barrier associated with the
transition state significantly enhances the reaction rate in many enzymes. We
use a path integral approach which provides a general framework to understand
tunneling in a quantum system which interacts with an environment at non-zero
temperature. Here the quantum system is the active site of the enzyme and the
environment is the surrounding protein and water. Tunneling well below the
barrier only occurs for temperatures less than a temperature $T_0$ which is
determined by the curvature of potential energy surface near the top of the
barrier. We argue that for most enzymes this temperature is less than room
temperature. For physically reasonable parameters quantum transition state
theory gives a quantitative description of the temperature dependence and
magnitude of kinetic isotope effects for two classes of enzymes which have been
claimed to exhibit signatures of quantum tunneling. The only quantum effects
are those associated with the transition state, both reflection at the barrier
top and tunneling just below the barrier. We establish that the friction due to
the environment is weak and only slightly modifies the reaction rate.
Furthermore, at room temperature and for typical energy barriers environmental
degrees of freedom with frequencies much less than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ do not have a
significant effect on quantum corrections to the reaction rate.

observed flooding of potentially existing tunneling amplitude by adding noise
to the chaotic sea to attenuate the destructive interference generating
dynamical localization. This phenomenon is related to the nature of complex
orbits describing tunneling between torus and chaotic regions. The tunneling
rate is found to obey a perturbative scaling with noise intensity when the
noise intensity is sufficiently small and then saturate in a large noise
intensity regime. A relation between the tunneling rate and the localization
length of the chaotic states is also demonstrated. It is shown that due to the
competition between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization, the

matter induced by a surface wave propagating along the flexible vacuum-matter
boundary by considering the nonlinear coupling between the interface and the
rarefaction effect. The nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic Navier-Stokes
equations was considered and analytically solved by a perturbation approach.
The critical reflux values associated with the product of the second-order body
forcing and the Reynolds number (representing the viscous dissipations)
decrease as the Knudsen number (representing the rarefaction measure) increases
from zero to 0.1. We obtained the critical bounds for possible dark states
corresponding to specific Reynolds numbers (ratio of wave inertia and viscous
dissipation effects) and wave numbers which might be linked to the dissipative
evolution of certain large-scale structure during the relativistic heavy-ion
collisions.

field in the Einstein-Cartan-Kibble-Sciama (ECKS) theory of gravity cannot form
singular configurations concentrated on one- or two-dimensional surfaces in
spacetime. Instead, such a field describes a nonsingular particle whose spatial
dimension is at least on the order of its Cartan radius. In particular, torsion
modifies Burinskii's model of the Dirac electron as a Kerr-Newman singular ring
of the Compton size, by replacing the ring with a toroidal structure with the
outer radius of the Compton size and the inner radius of the Cartan size. We
conjecture that torsion produced by spin prevents the formation of
singularities from matter composed of quarks and leptons. We expect that the
Cartan radius of an electron, ~10^{-27} m, introduces an effective ultraviolet
cutoff in quantum field theory for fermions in the ECKS spacetime. We also
estimate a maximum density of matter to be on the order of the corresponding
Cartan density, ~10^{51} kg m^{-3}, which gives a lower limit for black-hole
masses ~10^{16} kg. This limit corresponds to energy ~10^{43} GeV which is 39
orders of magnitude larger than the maximum beam energy currently available at
the LHC. Thus, if torsion exists and the ECKS theory of gravity is correct, the
LHC cannot produce micro black holes.

absence of fast equatorial solar wind streams and a low CME velocity which
allow us to relate the imaging and in-situ data in a straightforward way. The
STEREO-B spacecraft encountered typical signatures of a magnetic flux rope
inside an interplanetary CME (ICME) whose axis was inclined at 45 degree to the
solar equatorial plane. Various CME direction-finding techniques yield
consistent results to within 15 degree. Further, remote images from STEREO-A
show that (1) the CME is unambiguously connected to the ICME and can be tracked
all the way to 1 AU, (2) the particular arc-like morphology of the CME points
to an inclined axis, and (3) the three-part structure of the CME may be
plausibly related to the in situ data. This is a first step in predicting both
the direction of travel and the internal structure of CMEs from complete remote
observations between the Sun and 1 AU, which is one of the main requirements

core of the cluster MS0451.6-0305. It has been suggested that part of its
emission arises from the interaction between a LBG and two EROs at z~2.9 that
are multiply-imaged. However, the dramatic resolution difference between the
sub-mm map and the optical/NIR images make it difficult to confirm this
hypothesis. In this paper, we present a deep (~ 10 microJy/beam), high
resolution (~2 arcsec) 1.4 GHz radio map of the cluster core, in which we have
identified 6 sources located within SMM J04542-0301. The strong lensing effect
in the radio data has been quantified by constructing a new lens model of the
cluster. The brightest and most extended of these sources (RJ) is located in
the middle of the sub-mm emission, and has no obvious counterpart in the
optical/NIR. Three other detections (E1, E2 and E3) seem to be associated with
the images of one of the EROs. The last two detections (CR1 and CR2), for which
no optical/NIR counterpart have been found, seem to constitute two relatively
compact emitting regions embedded in a ~5 arcsec extended radio source located
at the position of the sub-mm peak. The presence of this extended component can
only be explained if it is being produced by a lensed region of dust obscured
star formation in the center of the merger. A comparison between the radio and
sub-mm data at the same resolution suggests that E1, E2, E3, CR1 and CR2 are
associated with the sub-mm emission. The radio observations provide strong
observational evidence in favor of the merger hypothesis. However, the question
if RJ is also contributing to the observed sub-mm emission remains open. These
results illustrate the promising prospects for radio interferometry and strong
gravitational lensing to study the internal structure of SMGs.

underlying dynamics cannot be precisely observed. Mathematical modeling of
biological systems with delays is usually based on Delay Differential Equations
(DDEs), a kind of differential equations in which the derivative of the unknown
function at a certain time is given in terms of the values of the function at
previous times. In the literature, delay stochastic simulation algorithms have
been proposed. These algorithms follow a ""delay as duration"" approach, namely
they are based on an interpretation of a delay as the elapsing time between the
start and the termination of a chemical reaction. This interpretation is not
suitable for some classes of biological systems in which species involved in a
delayed interaction can be involved at the same time in other interactions. We
show on a DDE model of tumor growth that the delay as duration approach for
stochastic simulation is not precise, and we propose a simulation algorithm
based on a ``purely delayed'' interpretation of delays which provides better
results on the considered model.

that 6.7-GHz methanol masers with higher peak luminosities are associated with

between dynamical and radiative processes in many astrophysical environments,
with particular interest for problems involving radiative shocks. There is a
widespread consensus that line emitting knots observed in Herbig-Haro jets can
be interpreted as radiative shocks. In this paper we address two different
aspects relevant to the time-dependent calculations of the line intensity
ratios of forbidden transitions, resulting from the excitation by planar,
time-dependent radiative shocks traveling in a stratified medium. The first one
concerns the impact of the radiation and ionization processes included in the
cooling model, and the second one the effects of the numerical grid resolution.
In this paper we apply the AMR methodology to the treatment of radiating shocks
and show how this method is able to vastly reduce the integration time. The
technique is applied to the knots of the HH 30 jet to obtain the observed line
intensity ratios and derive the physical parameters, such as density,
temperature and ionization fraction. We consider the impact of two different
cooling functions and different grid resolutions on the results. We conclude
that the use of different cooling routines has effects on results whose weight
depends upon the line ratio considered. Moreover, we find the minimum numerical
resolution of the simulation grid behind the shock to achieve convergence in
the results. This is crucial for the forthcoming 2D calculations of radiative
shocks.

The sample spans a mass range of 10^14 M_sun <M_500<10^15 M_sun. We derive an
average profile from observations scaled by mass and z according to the
standard self-similar model, and find that the dispersion about the mean is
remarkably low beyond 0.2R_500, but increases towards the centre. Deviations
about the mean are related to both the mass and the thermo-dynamical state of
the cluster. Unrelaxed systems have systematically shallower profiles while
cooling core systems are more concentrated. The scaled profiles exhibit a
residual mass dependence with a slope of about 0.12; however, the departure
from standard scaling decreases with radius and is consistent with zero at
R_500. The scatter in the core and departure from self-similar mass scaling is
smaller compared to that of the entropy profiles, showing that the pressure is
the quantity least affected by dynamical history and non-gravitational physics.
Comparison with several state of the art numerical simulations shows good
agreement outside the core. Combining the observational data below R_500 with
simulation data above, we derive the universal pressure profile, that, in an
analytical form, defines the physical pressure profile of clusters as a
function of mass and z up to the cluster 'boundary'. Using this profile and the
observed pressure profiles, we investigate the scaling properties of the
integrated Compton parameter Y, considering both the spherically integrated

infrared subpopulations, cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts show
similar evolutionary trends, galaxies with significant AGN contributions show
stronger positive evolution and Arp 220-type starbursts exhibit strong negative
evolution. The dominant subpopulation changes from cirrus-type galaxies to
M82-type starbursts at log (L_60 / L_Sun) ~ 10.3.
  In the second half of the paper, we derive the projected two-point spatial
correlation function for galaxies of different infrared template type. The mean
relative bias between cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts, which
correspond to quiescent galaxies with optically thin interstellar dust and
actively star-forming galaxies respectively, is calculated to be around 1.25.
The relation between current star formation rate (SFR) in star-forming galaxies

on infrared luminosity. We found that M82-type actively star-forming galaxies
show stronger clustering as infrared luminosity / SFR increases. The
correlation between clustering strength and SFR in the local Universe seems to
echo the basic trend seen in star-forming galaxies in the Great Observatories

crucial part of the large neighbourhood search is the selection of the fragment
(neighbourhood, i.e. the set of variables), to be relaxed and re-optimized
iteratively. The success of the large neighbourhood search depends on the
adequacy of this identified neighbourhood with regard to the problematic part
of the solution assignment and the choice of the neighbourhood size. We
investigate three strategies to choose the fragment of different sizes within
the large neighbourhood search scheme. The first two strategies are tailored
concerning the problem properties. The third strategy is more general, using
the information of the cost from the soft constraint violations and their
propagation as the indicator to choose the variables added into the fragment.
The three strategies are analyzed and compared upon a benchmark nurse rostering
problem. Promising results demonstrate the possibility of future work in the
hybrid approach.

multiprocessor BladeCenter machine with twin Cell/BE processors (total of 16
SPUs per blade). This algorithm was chosen because it fits very well the
Cell/BE architecture and requires neither shared memory nor communication
between processors, while retaining a compact memory footprint. We study the
performance on several large optimization benchmarks and show that this
achieves mostly linear time speedups, even sometimes super-linear. This is
possible because the parallel implementation might explore simultaneously
different parts of the search space and therefore converge faster towards the
best sub-space and thus towards a solution. Besides getting speedups, the
resulting times exhibit a much smaller variance, which benefits applications
where a timely reply is critical.

under different physical conditions is a nontrivial and interesting problem.
Aiming at understanding this issue for a related simpler system, we use Monte
Carlo methods to investigate the interplay between writhe and knotting of ring
polymers in good and poor solvents. The model that we consider is interacting
self-avoiding polygons on the simple cubic lattice. For polygons with fixed
knot type we find a writhe distribution whose average depends on the knot type
but is insensitive to the length $N$ of the polygon and to solvent conditions.
This ""topological contribution"" to the writhe distribution has a value that is
consistent with that of ideal knots. The standard deviation of the writhe
increases approximately as $\sqrt{N}$ in both regimes and this constitutes a
geometrical contribution to the writhe. If the sum over all knot types is
considered, the scaling of the standard deviation changes, for compact
polygons, to $\sim N^{0.6}$. We argue that this difference between the two
regimes can be ascribed to the topological contribution to the writhe that, for
compact chains, overwhelms the geometrical one thanks to the presence of a
large population of complex knots at relatively small values of $N$. For
polygons with fixed writhe we find that the knot distribution depends on the
chosen writhe, with the occurrence of achiral knots being considerably
suppressed for large writhe. In general, the occurrence of a given knot thus
depends on a nontrivial interplay between writhe, chain length, and solvent
conditions.

forbidden lines of Fe+, N+, Fe++, S++, Ne++ and Ar++ into spatially and
velocity-resolved rope-like features originating from collisionally-excited
ions photo-ionized by UV photons or collisions. While the [Fe II] emission
extends across a velocity range of +/-500 km/s out to 0.""7, more highly ionized
forbidden emissions are systematically blue-shifted (-500 to +200 km/s) and
extend only to 0.""4. The [Fe II] defines the outer regions of the massive
primary wind. The [N II], [Fe III] emission define the the outer wind
interaction regions directly photo-ionized by far-UV radiation. Variations in
emission of [S III] 9533A, 9071A and 6313A suggest density ranges of 10^6 to

likely belongs to the thin disk. The total DA to non-DA ratio of the 20 pc

transforms DA stars with sufficiently thin H surface layers into non-DAs. The
addition of 5 new stars to the 20 pc sample yields a revised local space
density of white dwarfs of $4.9\pm0.5 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$/yr and a
corresponding mass density of $3.3\pm0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\sun}$/pc$^{3}$.
We find that at least 15% of the white dwarfs within 20 parsecs of the sun (the
DAZ and DZ stars) have photospheric metals that possibly originate from
accretion of circumstellar material (debris disks) around them. If this
interpretation is correct, this suggests the possibility that the same
percentage have planets or asteroid-like bodies orbiting them.

are eventually periodic of period two (i.e., Tor_i^R(M,N) is isomorphic to
Tor_{i+2}^R(M,N) for i sufficiently large). Since R has only an isolated
singularity, these torsion modules are of finite length for i sufficiently
large. The theta invariant of the pair (M,N) is defined by Hochster to be
length(Tor_{2i}^R(M,N)) - length(Tor_{2i+1}^R(M,N)) for i sufficiently large.
H. Dao has conjectured that the theta invariant is zero for all pairs (M,N)
when R has even dimension and contains a field. This paper proves this
conjecture under the additional assumption that R is graded with its irrelevant
maximal ideal giving the isolated singularity. We also give a careful analysis
of the theta pairing when the dimension of R is odd, and relate it to a
classical pairing on the smooth variety Proj(R).

a $m_L/m_S$ ratio that is larger than commonly accepted values. We demonstrate
here that plural scattering may noticeably influence the $m_L/m_S$ ratio. An
equation is derived which describes its influence as a function of the spectral
integrals of the plasmon scattering region and zero-loss peak. The influence of
the electron-plasmon scattering can be removed when electron energy-loss
spectra of the ionization edge are deconvoluted by the low-loss signal. For a
bcc-Fe sample we obtain $m_L/m_S=0.04$ after plasmon removal. We conclude that
the plural scattering should be considered when extracting quantitative
information from EMCD measurements.

in oxypnictide LaFeAs(O,F) several families of superconductors based on Fe

with cuprate superconductors that compromise easy applications, such as the
layered structure, the small coherence length, and unconventional pairing, On
the other hand the Fe-based superconductors have metallic parent compounds, and
their electronic anisotropy is generally smaller and does not strongly depend
on the level of doping, the supposed order parameter symmetry is s wave, thus
in principle not so detrimental to current transmission across grain
boundaries. From the application point of view, the main efforts are still
devoted to investigate the superconducting properties, to distinguish intrinsic
from extrinsic behaviours and to compare the different families in order to
identify which one is the fittest for the quest for better and more practical
superconductors. The 1111 family shows the highest Tc, huge but also the most
anisotropic upper critical field and in-field, fan-shaped resistive transitions
reminiscent of those of cuprates, while the 122 family is much less anisotropic
with sharper resistive transitions as in low temperature superconductors, but
with about half the Tc of the 1111 compounds. An overview of the main
superconducting properties relevant to applications will be presented. Upper
critical field, electronic anisotropy parameter, intragranular and
intergranular critical current density will be discussed and compared, where

function, age-metallicity relation and trends of several abundance ratios with
metallicity. In this framework, the key condition to satisfy all the available
observational constraints is that a galactic-scale outflow develops in a much
more massive parent system, as a consequence of multiple supernova explosions
in a shallow potential well. This galactic wind must carry out preferentially
the metals produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae, whereas
elements restored to the interstellar medium through low-energy stellar winds
by both asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and massive stars must be mostly
retained. Assuming that helium is ejected through slow winds by both AGB stars

non-orthogonal selection decode-and-forward (NSDF), orthogonal selection
decode-and-forward (OSDF), non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward (NAF), and
orthogonal amplify-and-forward (OAF). The transmitter nodes are assumed to send
pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) signals asynchronously, in which information
symbols are linearly modulated by a shaping waveform to be sent to the
destination. We consider two different cases with respect to the length of the
shaping waveforms in the time domain. In the theoretical case where the shaping
waveforms with infinite time support are used, it is shown that asynchronism
does not affect the DMT performance of the system and the same DMT as that of
the corresponding synchronous network is obtained for all the aforementioned
protocols. In the practical case where finite length shaping waveforms are
used, it is shown that better diversity gains can be achieved at the expense of
bandwidth expansion. In the decode-and-forward (DF) type protocols, the
asynchronous network provides better diversity gains than those of the
corresponding synchronous network throughout the range of the multiplexing
gain. In the amplify-and-forward (AF) type protocols, the asynchronous network
provides the same DMT as that of the corresponding synchronous counterpart
under the OAF protocol; however, a better diversity gain is achieved under the
NAF protocol throughout the range of the multiplexing gain. In particular, in
the single relay asynchronous network, the NAF protocol provides the same DMT
as that of the 2 {\times} 1 multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel.
