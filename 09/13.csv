  Optimization using JavaSpaces Technology",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peptide Optimization is a highly complex problem and it takes very long time
of computation. This optimization process uses many software applications in a
cluster running GNU/Linux Operating System that perform special tasks. The
application to organize the whole optimization process had been already
developed, namely SEPP (System for Evolutionary Pareto Optimization of
Peptides/Polymers). A single peptide optimization takes a lot of computation
time to produce a certain number of individuals. However, it can be accelerated
by increasing the degree of parallelism as well as the number of nodes
(processors) in the cluster. In this master thesis, I build a model simulating
the interplay of the programs so that the usage of each resource (processor)
can be determined and also the approximated time needed for the overall
optimization process. There are two Evolutionary Algorithms that could be used
in the optimization, namely Generation-based and Steady-state Evolutionary
Algorithm. The results of each Evolutionary Algorithm are shown based on the
simulations. Moreover, the results are also compared by using different
parameters (the degree of parallelism and the number of processors) in the
simulation to give an overview of the advantages and the disadvantages of the
algorithms in terms of computation time and resource usage. The model is built
up using JavaSpaces Technology.

successive nights with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter. Our tomographic imaging
technique applied to time series of rotationally modulated circularly polarized
profiles reveals an axisymmetric large-scale poloidal magnetic field on the M4
dwarf. We then apply a synthetic spectrum fitting technique for measuring the
average magnetic flux on the star. The flux measured in G 164-31 is Bf =
3.2+-0.4 kG, which is significantly greater than the average value of 0.68 kG
determined from the imaging technique. The difference indicates that a
significant fraction of the stellar magnetic energy is stored in small-scale
structures at the surface of G 164-31. Our H_alpha emission light curve shows
evidence for rotational modulation suggesting the presence of localized
structure in the chromosphere of this M dwarf. The radius of the M4 dwarf
derived from the rotational period and the projected equatorial velocity is at
least 30% larger than that predicted from theoretical models. We argue that
this discrepancy is likely primarily due to the young nature of G 164-31 rather
than primarily due to magnetic field effects, indicating that age is an
important factor which should be considered in the interpretation of this
observational result. We also report here our polarimetric observations of five
other M dwarfs with spectral types from M0 to M4.5, three of them showing
strong Zeeman signatures.

(CQT), as developed by Griffiths and others over the past 25 years. The theory
is a version of orthodox(Copenhagen) quantum mechanics, based on the notion
that the unique and mysterious feature of quantum, as opposed to classical,
systems is the simultaneous existence of multiple incompatible representations
of reality, referred to as ""frameworks"". A framework is a maximal set of
properties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.
This notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set
of exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully
characterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible
frameworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior. Any prediction of
the theory must be confined to a single framework and combining elements from
different frameworks leads to quantum mechanically meaningless statements. This
""single framework rule"" is the precise mathematical statement of Bohr's
complementarity. It is shown that if the microscopic description is assumed to
incorporate these elements in a local setting, then distant entanglements,
macroscopic measurements, wave function collapse and other mysterious features
of quantum behavior follow in a logical manner. The essential elements of the
theory are first explained using the simplest quantum system, a single spin-1/2
degree of freedom at one time.

To overcome the challenges, there is a need to build a multifence security
solution that achieves both broad protection and desirable network performance.
MANETs are vulnerable to various attacks, blackhole, is one of the possible
attacks. Black hole is a type of routing attack where a malicious node
advertise itself as having the shortest path to all nodes in the environment by
sending fake route reply. By doing this, the malicious node can deprive the
traffic from the source node. It can be used as a denial-of-service attack
where it can drop the packets later. In this paper, we proposed a DPRAODV

Previously we derived several discrete distributions to describe earthquake
numbers for the branching model of earthquake occurrence: these distributions
are the Poisson, geometric, logarithmic, and the negative binomial (NBD). The
theoretical model is the `birth and immigration' population process. The first
three distributions above can be considered special cases of the NBD. In
particular, a point branching process along the magnitude (or log seismic
moment) axis with independent events (immigrants) explains the
magnitude/moment-frequency relation and the NBD of earthquake counts in large
time/space windows, as well as the dependence of the NBD parameters on the
magnitude threshold (magnitude of an earthquake catalog completeness). We
discuss applying these distributions, especially the NBD, to approximate event
numbers in earthquake catalogs. There are many different representations of the
NBD. Most can be traced either to the Pascal distribution or to the mixture of
the Poisson distribution with the gamma law. We discuss advantages and
drawbacks of both representations for statistical analysis of earthquake
catalogs. We also consider applying the NBD to earthquake forecasts and
describe the limits of the application for the given equations. In contrast to
the one-parameter Poisson distribution so widely used to describe earthquake
occurrence, the NBD has two parameters. The second parameter can be used to
characterize clustering or over-dispersion of a process. We determine the
parameter values and their uncertainties for several local and global catalogs,
and their subdivisions in various time intervals, magnitude thresholds, spatial
windows, and tectonic categories.

by HeII and HeI during the epoch of cosmological recombination by HeI and HI.
We demonstrate that, in comparison to computations which neglect all feedback
processes, the number of cosmological recombination photons that are related to
the presence of helium in the early Universe could be increased by ~40%-70%.
Our computations imply that per helium nucleus ~3-6 additional photons could be
produced. Therefore, a total of ~12-14 helium-related photons are emitted
during cosmological recombination. This is an important addition to
cosmological recombination spectrum which in the future may render it slightly
easier to determine the primordial abundance of helium using differential
measurements of the CMB energy spectrum. Also, since these photons are the only
witnesses of the feedback process at high redshift, observing them in principle
offers a way to check our understanding of the recombination physics. Here most
interestingly, the feedback of HeII photons on HeI leads to the appearance of
several additional, rather narrow spectral features in the HeI recombination
spectrum at low frequencies. Consequently, the signatures of helium-related
features in the CMB spectral distortion due to cosmological recombination at
some given frequency can exceed the average level of ~17% several times. We
find that in particular the bands around nu ~10GHz, ~35GHz, ~80GHz, and ~200GHz
seem to be affected strongly. In addition, we computed the changes in the
cosmological ionization history, finding that only the feedback of primary HeI
photons on the dynamics of HeII-->HeI recombination has an effect, producing a
change of DN_e/N_e ~+ 0.17% at z~2300. This result seems to be ~2-3 times
smaller than the one obtained in earlier computations for this process

series of length-scales. Our decomposition is based on a multiscale
generalization of the ``Germano identity'' for smooth, graded filter kernels.
We employ this method to derive a budget equation that describes the transfers
of turbulent kinetic energy both in space and in scale. It is shown that the
inter-scale energy transfer is dominated by local triadic interactions,
assuming only the scaling properties expected in a turbulent inertial-range. We
derive rigorous upper bounds on the contributions of non-local triads,
extending the work of Eyink (2005) for low-pass filtering. We also propose a
physical explanation of the differing exponents for our rigorous upper bounds
and for the scaling predictions of Kraichnan (1966,1971). The faster decay
predicted by Kraichnan is argued to be the consequence of additional
cancellations in the signed contributions to transfer from non-local triads,
after averaging over space. This picture is supported by data from a $512^3$

neutral particles are dynamically well coupled to the field already at the

plasma one can identify four distinct sub-regimes in the parameter domain where
the Hall diffusivity dominates and three sub-regimes in the Ohm-dominated

diffusion-like and two as being Ohm-like. When the two-component plasma
consists instead of positively and negatively charged grains of equal mass, the

anti-phase aperiodic to degenerate periodic spectra at the critical energy
$\epsilon_c$ which is determined by a bifurcation point of the bulk energy

doubles the period of the periodic spectra at $\epsilon>\epsilon_c$ . Shift of

strange $K_2^{\ast 0} (1430)$ tensor meson are calculated in the framework of
the light cone QCD sum rules. It is observed that the values of the magnetic
dipole moment for the charged tensor particles are considerably different from
zero. These values are very close to zero for the light neutral $f_2$ and $a_2$
tensor mesons, while it has a small nonzero value for the neutral strange
$K_2^{\ast 0} (1430)$ tensor meson.

systems are studied in the intermediate electron-phonon coupling regime. The
total energies of 2D polaron and bipolaron are calculated by using the
Buimistrov-Pekar method of canonical transformations and analyzed in the weak,
intermediate and strong coupling regimes. It is shown that the electron-phonon
correlation significantly reduces the total energy of 2D polaron in comparison
with the energy of the strong-coupling (adiabatic) polaron. A charge carrier in
polar crystals remains localized in a 2D potential well when the
electron-phonon coupling constant $\alpha$ is greater than the critical value
$\alpha_{c}\simeq2.94$, which is much lower than a critical value of the
electron-phonon coupling constant $\alpha$ for a 3D system. The critical values
of the electron-phonon coupling constant $\alpha$ and the parameter of Coulomb
repulsion between two carriers $\beta=1/(1-\epsilon_{\infty}/\epsilon_{0})$
(where $\epsilon_{\infty}$ and $\epsilon_{0}$ are the high frequency and static
dielectric constants, respectively), which determine the bipolaron stability
region, are numerically calculated. The obtained results are compared with the
ones obtained by using the Feynman path integral method and the modified
Lee-Low-Pines unitary transformation method.

synchronous behavior, in networks of identical units, that cannot be produced
by single units in isolation. In particular, we show that synchronous chaos can
emerge in networks of simple units. Conversely, in networks of chaotic units
simple synchronous dynamics can emerge; that is, chaos can be suppressed
through synchrony.

superpotential 2-form are discussed in the covariant teleparallel framework,
where the Weitzenb\""ock connection represents inertial effects related to the
choice of the frame. Due to its odd asymptotic behavior, the contribution of
the inertial effects often yields unphysical (divergent or trivial) results for
the total energy of the system. However, in the covariant teleparallel
approach, the energy is always finite and nontrivial. The teleparallel
connection plays a role of a regularizing tool which subtracts the inertial
effects without distorting the true gravitational contribution. As a crucial
test of the covariant formalism, we reanalyze the computation of the total
energy of the Schwarzschild and the Kerr solutions.
