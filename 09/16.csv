planets around A stars. These widely separated giants have been interpreted as
signs of planet formation driven by gravitational instability, but the
viability of this mechanism is not clear cut. In this paper, we first discuss
the local requirements for fragmentation and the initial fragment mass scales.
We then consider whether the fragment's subsequent growth can be terminated
within the planetary mass regime. Finally, we place disks in the larger context
of star formation and disk evolution models. We find that in order for
gravitational instability to produce planets, disks must be atypically cold in
order to reduce the initial fragment mass. In addition, fragmentation must
occur during a narrow window of disk evolution, after infall has mostly ceased,
but while the disk is still sufficiently massive to undergo gravitational
instability. Under more typical conditions, disk-born objects will likely grow
well above the deuterium burning planetary mass limit. We conclude that if
planets are formed by gravitational instability, they must be the low mass tail
of the distribution of disk-born companions. To validate this theory, on-going
direct imaging surveys must find a greater abundance of brown dwarf and M-star
companions to A-stars. Their absence would suggest planet formation by a
different mechanism such as core accretion, which is consistent with the debris
disks detected in these systems.

of self-assembling agents are: (1) necessary and sufficient conditions to
produce a unique terminal assembly, and (2) error correction. We address both
questions, by reducing two well-studied models of tile assembly to models of
distributed shared memory (DSM), in order to obtain results from the memory
consistency systems induced by tile assembly systems when simulated in the DSM
setting. The Abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) can be simulated by a DSM
system that obeys causal consistency, and the locally deterministic tile
assembly systems in the aTAM correspond exactly to the concurrent-write free
programs that simulate tile assembly in such a model. Thus, the detection of
the failure of local determinism (which had formerly been an open problem)
reduces to the detection of data races in simulating programs. Further, the
Kinetic Tile Assembly Model can be simulated by a DSM system that obeys GWO, a
memory consistency condition defined by Steinke and Nutt. (To our knowledge,
this is the first natural example of a DSM system that obeys GWO, but no
stronger consistency condition.) We combine these results with the observation
that self-assembly algorithms are local algorithms, and there exists a fast
conversion of deterministic local algorithms into deterministic
self-stabilizing algorithms. This provides an ""immediate"" generalization of a
theorem by Soloveichik et al. about the existence of tile assembly systems that
simultaneously perform two forms of self-stabilization: proofreading and
self-healing. Our reductions and proof techniques can be extended to the
programming of self-assembling agents in a variety of media, not just DNA
tiles, and not just two-dimensional surfaces.

Vertex Deletion problem, it is NP-hard and motivated by graph-based data

from a graph so that its connected components become cliques, the task in
s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion is to delete vertices from a graph so that its
connected components become s-plexes. An s-plex is a graph in which every
vertex is nonadjacent to at most s-1 other vertices; a clique is an 1-plex. In
contrast to Cluster Vertex Deletion, s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion allows to
balance the number of vertex deletions against the sizes and the density of the
resulting clusters, which are s-plexes instead of cliques. The focus of this
work is the development of provably efficient and effective data reduction
rules for s-Plex Cluster Vertex Deletion. In terms of fixed-parameter
algorithmics, these yield a so-called problem kernel. A similar problem, s-Plex
Editing, where the task is the insertion or the deletion of edges so that the
connected components of a graph become s-plexes, has also been studied in terms
of fixed-parameter algorithmics. Using the number of allowed graph
modifications as parameter, we expect typical parameter values for s-Plex
Cluster Vertex Deletion to be significantly lower than for s-Plex Editing,
because one vertex deletion can lead to a high number of edge deletions. This
holds out the prospect for faster fixed-parameter algorithms for s-Plex Cluster
Vertex Deletion.

$T(z)=T_{0}(1+z)^{1-\alpha}$, which contrasts the prediction of the standard

alternative cosmological models. The statistical analysis is based on two main
approaches: using ratios of the S-Z intensity change, $\Delta I$, thus taking
advantage of the weak dependence of the ratios on IC gas properties, and using
directly the $\Delta I$ measurements. In the former method dependence on the
Thomson optical depth and gas temperature is only second order in these
quantities. In the second method we marginalize over these quantities which
appear to first order in the intensity change. The marginalization itself is
done in two ways - by direct integrations, and by a Monte Carlo Markov Chain

with gamma-ray sources, the presence of OH(1720 MHz) masers is used to identify
interaction with dense gas and to provide a kinematic distance to the system.
In this paper we use statistical tests to demonstrate that there is a
correlation between these masers and a class of GeV- to TeV-energy gamma-ray
sources coincident with interacting remnants. For pion decay, the gamma-ray
luminosity provides a direct estimate of the local cosmic ray density. We find
the cosmic ray density is enhanced by one to two orders of magnitude over the
local solar value, comparable to X-ray-induced ionization in these remnants.

the phase transition between the physical Higgs phase and the unphysical
symmetric phase of the lattice model, where the continuum physics is to be
approached. We represent the results of our numerical investigation of the

demonstrate that at $\lambda = \infty$ the upper bound on the cutoff is around
$\frac{\pi}{a} = 1.4$ Tev. The preliminary results for finite $\lambda$ are
also presented. Basing on these results we cannot yet make a definite

vorticity (W), entropy (S) and compressional (P) modes and their coupling
properties. The system exhibits asymmetric three-mode coupling: these include
mutual coupling of S and P-modes, S and W-modes, and asymmetric coupling
between the W and P-modes. P-mode perturbations are able to generate potential
vorticity through indirect three-mode coupling. This process indicates that
compressional perturbations can lead to the development of vortical structures
and influence the dynamics of radially stratified hydrodynamic accretion and
protoplanetary discs.

observed both on the solar disk and above the solar limb. Coronal holes are
associated with rapidly expanding open magnetic fields and the acceleration of
the high-speed solar wind. This paper reviews measurements of the plasma
properties in coronal holes and how these measurements are used to reveal
details about the physical processes that heat the solar corona and accelerate
the solar wind. It is still unknown to what extent the solar wind is fed by
flux tubes that remain open (and are energized by footpoint-driven wave-like
fluctuations), and to what extent much of the mass and energy is input
intermittently from closed loops into the open-field regions. Evidence for both
paradigms is summarized in this paper. Special emphasis is also given to
spectroscopic and coronagraphic measurements that allow the highly dynamic
non-equilibrium evolution of the plasma to be followed as the asymptotic
conditions in interplanetary space are established in the extended corona. For
example, the importance of kinetic plasma physics and turbulence in coronal
holes has been affirmed by surprising measurements from UVCS that heavy ions
are heated to hundreds of times the temperatures of protons and electrons.
These observations point to specific kinds of collisionless Alfven wave damping
(i.e., ion cyclotron resonance), but complete models do not yet exist. Despite
our incomplete knowledge of the complex multi-scale plasma physics, however,
much progress has been made toward the goal of understanding the mechanisms
responsible for producing the observed properties of coronal holes.

measure the evolution of the number density of luminous galaxies in this
redshift range and derive useful constraints on the evolution of their
Luminosity Function. We present here the first results of an ESO Large Program,
that exploits the unique combination of area and sensitivity provided in the
near-IR by the camera Hawk-I at the VLT. We have obtained two Hawk-I pointings
on the GOODS South field for a total of 32 observing hours, covering ~90
arcmin2. The images reach Y=26.7 mags for the two fields. We have used public
ACS images in the z band to select z-dropout galaxies with the colour criteria
Z-Y>1, Y-J<1.5 and Y-K<2. The other public data in the UBVRIJHK bands are used
to reject possible low redshift interlopers. The output has been compared with
extensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify the observational effects of our
selection criteria as well as the effects of photometric errors. We detect 7
high quality candidates in the magnitude range Y=25.5-26.7. This interval
samples the critical range for M* at z>6 (M_1500 ~- 19.5 to -21.5). After
accounting for the expected incompleteness, we rule out at a 99% confidence
level a Luminosity Function constant from z=6 to z=7, even including the
effects of cosmic variance. For galaxies brighter than M_1500=-19.0 we derive a
luminosity density rho_UV=1.5^{+2.0}_{-0.9} 10^25 erg/s/Hz/Mpc3, implying a
decrease by a factor 3.5 from z=6 to z~6.8. On the basis of our findings, we
make predictions for the surface densities expected in future surveys surveys,

Herculis -- has resisted explanation for 30 years. The observed precession rate
is a factor of four slower than the theoretical rate, a disagreement that once
was interpreted as evidence for a failure of general relativity. Among the
contemporary explanations are the existence of a circumbinary planet and a
large tilt of the stellar spin axes with respect to the orbit. Here we report
that both stars of DI Herculis rotate with their spin axes nearly perpendicular

interactions. One was found to have a polar HI disk with no stellar
counterpart. While our small number statistics so far are limiting, results
support past findings that most void galaxies are typically late type galaxies
with gas rich disks and small scale clustering similar to field galaxies
despite their large scale underdense environment.

methods for calculating the growth of massive black holes (BH) in galactic

including a subgrid model for accretion produced by angular momentum transport
on unresolved scales. The impact of the BHs radiation on surrounding gas is
approximated by depositing momentum into the ambient gas, which produces an
outward force away from the BH. We argue that these phenomenological models for
BH growth and feedback better approximate the interaction between the BH and
dense gas in galaxies than previous models. We show that this physics leads to
self-regulated black hole growth: during the peak of activity, the accretion
rate onto the BH is largely determined by the physics of BH feedback, not the
subgrid accretion model. The BH significantly modifies the gas dynamics in the
galactic nucleus (< 300 pc), but does not generate large-scale galactic
outflows. Integrated over an entire galaxy merger, BH feedback has little
effect on the total number of stars formed, but is crucial for setting the BHs

find that there are four main periods of enhancement of star formation: a young
one peaked at around 0.2-0.5 Gyr old, only present in the eastern and in the
central-most fields; two at intermediate ages present in all fields (a
conspicuous one peaked at 4-5 Gyr old, and a less significant one peaked at
1.5-2.5); and an old one, peaked at 10 Gyr in all fields but the western ones.
In the western fields, this old enhancement splits into two, one peaked at
around 8 Gyr old and another at around 12 Gyr old. This ""two-enhancement"" zone
seems to be a robust feature since it is unaffected by our choice of stellar
evolutionary library but more data covering other fields of the SMC are
necessary in order to ascertain its significancy.
  Some correlation could exist with encounters taken from the orbit
determination of Kallivayalil et al. (2006). But our results would be also fit
in a first pericenter passage scenario like the one claimed by Besla et al.

current irregular shape of the SMC. We find that this dichotomy is produced by
the youngest population and began about 1 Gyr ago or later. We do not find yet
a region dominated by an old halo at 4.5 kpc from the SMC center, indicating
either that this old stellar halo does not exist in the SMC or that its
contribution to the stellar populations, at the galactocentric distances of our
outermost field, is negligible. We derive the age-metallicity relation and find
that the metallicity increased continuously from early epochs until now.

binaries (through tidal two-body and three-body exchange interactions) and
direct impacts of compact objects (WD/NS/BH). We show that if the primordial
binary fraction is small, close encounters dominate the production rate of
coalescing compact systems. We find that the two dominant channels are the
interaction of field NSs with dynamically formed binaries, and two-body
encounters. We then estimate the redshift distribution and host galaxy
demographics of SGRB progenitors, and find that GCs can provide a significant
contribution to the overall observed rate.
  We have carried out hydrodynamical modeling of evolution of close stellar
encounters with WD/NS/BH, and show that there is no problem in accounting for
the energy budget of a typical SGRB. The particulars of each encounter are
variable and lead to interesting diversity: the encounter characteristics are
dependent on the impact parameter, in contrast to the merger scenario; the
nature of the compact star itself can produce very different outcomes; the
presence of tidal tails in which material falls back onto the central object at
later times is a robust feature of these calculations, with the mass involved
being larger than for binary mergers. It is thus possible to account
generically in this scenario for a prompt episode of energy release, as well as
for activity many dynamical time scales later (abridged).

concluded that the Luttinger theorem (LT) does not apply for the Mott-Hubbard
(MH) insulating phase of this model (i.e. for V >> t) in the thermodynamic
limit; KP even suggested, incorrectly, that failure of the LT were apparent for
a half-filled finite system consisting of N=26 lattice sites. By employing a
simple model for the self-energy Sigma of a MH state, we show that the
finite-size-scaling approach of the type utilised by KP is not reliable for the
system sizes considered by KP. On the basis of the equivalence of the model
under consideration (at half-filling and for t'/t << 1) and the XXZ spin-chain
Hamiltonian for SU(2) spins, we further show that for V > V_c(t,t') the system
under consideration has a charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state (GS) in the
thermodynamic limit, corresponding to a doubling of the unit cell in comparison
with that specific to the underlying lattice. Although this GS is also
insulating, its spectral gap is due to the broken translational symmetry of the

for this GS. This fact establishes that the conclusion by KP is indeed

light on the mechanism underlying the robustness of the LT. In an appendix, we

many young early-B stars. It is associated with a well-known bright rimmed
nebula, the nature of which is unclear (fossil HII region or supernova
remnant). To help elucidate the nature of the nebula, our goal was to
reconstruct the star-formation history of the CMa R1 region, including the
previously unknown older, fainter low-mass stellar population, using X-rays. We
analyzed images obtained with the ROSAT satellite, covering ~5 sq. deg.
Complementary VRI photometry was performed with the Gemini South telescope.
Colour-magnitude and colour-colour diagrams were used in conjunction with
pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks to derive the masses and ages of the
X-ray sources. The ROSAT images show two distinct clusters. One is associated
with the known optical clusters near Z CMa, to which ~40 members are added. The
other, which we name the ""GU CMa"" cluster, is new, and contains ~60 members.
The ROSAT sources are young stars with masses down to M_star ~0.5 M_sun, and
ages up to 10 Myr. The mass functions of the two clusters are similar, but the
GU CMa cluster is older than the cluster around Z CMa by at least a few Myr.
Also, the GU CMa cluster is away from any molecular cloud, implying that star
formation must have ceased; on the contrary (as already known), star formation
is very active in the Z CMa region.

vary dramatically between proteins. Perhaps surprisingly, it is controversial
how much a protein's functional importance affects its rate of evolution. In
most studies, functional importance has been measured on the coarse scale of
protein knock-outs, while evolutionary rate has been measured on the fine scale
of amino acid substitutions. Here we introduce dynamical influence, a finer
measure of protein functional importance. To measure dynamical influence, we
first use detailed biochemical models of particular reaction networks to
measure the influence of each reaction rate constant on network dynamics. We
then define the dynamical influence of a protein to be the average influence of
the rate constants for all reactions it is involved in.
  Using models of a dozen biochemical systems and sequence data from
vertebrates, we show that dynamical influence and evolutionary rate are
negatively correlated; proteins with greater dynamical influence evolve more
slowly. We also show that proteins with greater dynamical influence are not
more likely to be essential. This suggests that there are many cellular
reactions whose presence is essential for life, but whose quantitative rate is
relatively unimportant to fitness. We also provide evidence that the effect of
dynamical influence on evolutionary rate is independent of protein expression
level, expression specificity, gene compactness, and reaction degree. Dynamical
influence offers a finer view of functional importance, and our results suggest
that focusing on essentiality may have previously led to an underestimation of
the role function plays in protein evolution.

requiring a lower feedback rate than the pure ICIC approach. The employed
metric is sum rate, which is normally a dubious metric for cellular systems,

games by taking into account different noise channels. Our calculations show
that entanglement can play a crucial role in quantum Parrondo's games. It is
seen that for the maximally entangled initial state in the presence of
decoherence, the quantum phases strongly influence the payoffs for various
sequences of the game. The effect of amplitude damping channel leads to winning
payoffs. Whereas the depolarizing and phase damping channels lead to the losing
payoffs. In case of amplitude damping channel, the payoffs are enhanced in the
presence of decoherence for the sequence AAB. This is because the quantum
phases interfere constructively which leads to the quantum enhancement of the
payoffs in comparison to the undecohered case. It is also seen that the quantum
phase angles damp the payoffs significantly in the presence of decoherence.
Furthermore, it is seen that for multiple games of sequence AAB, under the
influence of amplitude damping channel, the game still remains a winning game.
However, the quantum enhancement reduces in comparison to the single game of
sequence AAB because of the destructive interference of phase dependent terms.
In case of depolarizing channel, the game becomes a loosing game. It is seen
that for the game sequence B the game is loosing one and the behavior of
sequences B and BB is similar for amplitude damping and depolarizing channels.
In addition, the repeated games of A are only influenced by the amplitude
damping channel and the game remains a losing game. Furthermore, it is also
seen that for any sequence when played in series, the phase damping channel
does not influence the game.

success on the current generation of X-Ray telescopes (e.g. Chandra, XMM,
Suzaku, and Swift). However their bucket-brigade read-out architecture, which
transfers charge across the chip with discrete component readout electronics,
results in clockrate limited readout speeds that cause pileup (saturation) of
bright sources and an inherent susceptibility to radiation induced displacement
damage that limits mission lifetime. In contrast, HCDs read pixels with low
power, on-chip multiplexer electronics in a random access fashion. Faster frame
rates achieved with multi-output readout design will allow the next
generation's larger effective area telescopes to observe bright sources free of
pileup. Radiation damaged lattice sites effect a single pixel instead of an
entire row. Random access, multi-output readout will allow for novel readout
modes such as simultaneous bright-source-fast/whole-chip-slow readout. In order
for HCDs to be useful as X-Ray detectors, they must show noise and energy
resolution performance similar to CCDs while retaining advantages inherent to

provides a basis for the ubiquitous presence of h/2e in the theory and
phenomenology. However, the lack of a consistent real-space picture of
phonon-mediated pairing suggests that the pairing interpretation may be
incomplete or even misleading. Alternatively, the present picture refers back
to an old proposal by Frohlich, whereby superconductivity is based on an
induced electron charge density wave coupled to a one-dimensional static
lattice distortion. In the new picture, dynamic three-dimensional
charge-density waves couple to coherent standing-wave phonons, giving rise to a
mobile superconducting ground state that does not pin on crystalline defects.
Long-range order in the ground state is associated with localized electron
orbitals in a correlated two-phase field, which provides for flux quantization
in units of h/2e on the macroscopic scale larger than the coherence length,
without the need for a macroscopic pair wave function. While much of the
formalism for this picture may carry over from conventional BCS theory, this
picture makes distinct predictions for observable structures on the microscopic

show that such a limiting distribution exists, which can be given explicitly in

Known algorithms for this problem (Ben-David et al., 2001; Gavinsky, 2002;
Kalai et al., 2008) follow the same strategy as boosting algorithms in the PAC
model: the weak learner is executed on the same target function but over
different distributions on the domain. We demonstrate boosting algorithms for
the agnostic learning framework that only modify the distribution on the labels
of the points (or, equivalently, modify the target function). This allows
boosting a distribution-specific weak agnostic learner to a strong agnostic
learner with respect to the same distribution.
  When applied to the weak agnostic parity learning algorithm of Goldreich and
Levin (1989) our algorithm yields a simple PAC learning algorithm for DNF and
an agnostic learning algorithm for decision trees over the uniform distribution
using membership queries. These results substantially simplify Jackson's famous
DNF learning algorithm (1994) and the recent result of Gopalan et al. (2008).

constructions that achieve the optimal hard-core set size (given by Holenstein

interest due to their generality, good convergence properties, and possible
biological relevance. In this paper, we introduce an online temporal difference
based actor-critic algorithm which is proved to converge to a neighborhood of a
local maximum of the average reward. Linear function approximation is used by
the critic in order estimate the value function, and the temporal difference
signal, which is passed from the critic to the actor. The main distinguishing
feature of the present convergence proof is that both the actor and the critic
operate on a similar time scale, while in most current convergence proofs they
are required to have very different time scales in order to converge. Moreover,
the same temporal difference signal is used to update the parameters of both
the actor and the critic. A limitation of the proposed approach, compared to
results available for two time scale convergence, is that convergence is
guaranteed only to a neighborhood of an optimal value, rather to an optimal
value itself. The single time scale and identical temporal difference signal
used by the actor and the critic, may provide a step towards constructing more
biologically realistic models of reinforcement learning in the brain.

H-burning at high temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars,
now extinct. Using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension of
the Na-O anticorrelation), we can define 3 components of the stellar population
in GCs: a primordial component (P) of first-generation stars, and 2 components
of second-generation stars (intermediate I and extreme E populations from their
different chemical composition). The P component is present in all GCs, and its
fraction is almost constant at about one third. The I component represents the
bulk of the cluster population. The E component is not present in all GCs, and
it is more conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive ones. We
discuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in our

find that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum O and
maximum Na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change that is

Variations in Al are present in all but a few GCs. Finally, a spread in
abundances of Mg and Si are also present in a few clusters. Mg is slightly less
overabundant and Si slightly more overabundant in the most Al-rich stars. The
correlation between Si and Al abundances is a signature of production of 28Si
leaking from the Mg-Al cycle in a few clusters. The cross sections required for
the proper reactions to take over in the cycle point to temperatures in excess
of about 65 MK for the favoured site of production. We used a dilution model to
infer the total range of Al abundances starting from the Al abundances in the
UVES spectra, and the Na abundance distributions found from analysis of the
much larger set of stars for which GIRAFFE spectra were available. We found
that the maximum amount of additional Al produced by first generation polluters
contributing to the composition of the second generation stars in each cluster
is closely correlated with the same combination of metallicity and cluster
luminosity that reproduced the minimum O abundances found from GIRAFFE spectra.
We then suggest that the high temperatures required for the Mg-Al cycle are

halos, the SM straightforwardly expresses the equilibrium of the IntraCluster
Plasma (ICP) modulated by the entropy deposited at the boundary by standing
shocks from gravitational accretion, and injected at the center by outgoing
blastwaves from mergers or from outbursts of Active Galactic Nuclei. The
cluster set analyzed here highlights not only how simply the SM represents the
main dichotomy Cool vs. Non Cool Core clusters in terms of a few ICP parameters
governing the radial entropy run, but also how accurately it fits even complex
brightness and temperature profiles. For Cool Core clusters like A2199 and
A2597, the SM with a low level of central entropy straightforwardly yields the
characteristic peaked profile of the temperature marked by a decline toward the
center, without requiring currently strong radiative cooling and high mass
deposition rates. Non Cool Core clusters like A1656 require instead a central
entropy floor of a substantial level, and some like A2256 and even more A644
feature structured temperature profiles that also call for a definite floor
extension; in such conditions the SM accurately fits the observations, and
suggests that in these clusters the ICP has been just remolded by a merger
event, in the way of a remnant cool core. The SM also predicts that dark matter
halos with high concentration should correlate with flatter entropy profiles
and steeper brightness in the outskirts; this is indeed the case with A1689.

use in smart materials and structures. When heated from cold state (below the
transformation temperature, which can either be the glass transition
temperature or the melting temperature of the polymer) to hot state (above the
transformation temperature) they undergo transformation which can be compared
with martensitic transformation of shape memory alloys. This process induces
great changes of the mechanical properties and some shape memory phenomenon can
be observed. This study is an experimental evaluation of the mechanical
properties of SMP Veriflex under different test conditions. Veriflex was chosen
because of its easy accessibility. Furthermore its properties are similar to
epoxy resins which make it very suitable for usage in a wide variety of
technical applications. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to determine
evolution of the viscoelastic properties versus temperature and frequency under
cyclic harmonic loading. The glass transition temperature clearly appears in a
range from 45\degree C to 60\degree C depending on loading frequency. The glass
transition is noticeably marked by an impressive decrease in the storage
modulus of about 4 decades. The master curve of Veriflex was created and allows
the time-temperature superposition to be constructed for this material.
Thermo-mechanical working cycle of SMP with 100% elongation was also
experimentally tested. Finally results from all these experimental
investigations were used to design a demonstrator showing the possibility of
application in engineering and especially for shape control.

described by a simple model comprising a power law X-ray continuum plus its
reflection off the accretion disc. If the inner disc radius we measure (<=3.8
gravitational radii) is identified with the innermost stable circular orbit of
the black hole spacetime, we infer that the black hole powering RBS 1124 is
rotating rapidly with spin a>= 0.6. The soft excess contribution in the 0.5-2
keV band is ~15%, about half than that typically observed in unobscured Seyfert
1 galaxies and quasars, in line with the low disc reflection fraction we
measure (R_disc ~0.4). The low reflection fraction cannot be driven by disc
truncation which is at odds not only with the small inner disc radius we infer
but, most importantly, with the radiatively efficient nature of the source
(L_Bol / L_Edd ~1). A plausible explanation is that the X-ray corona is the
base of a failed jet (RBS 1124 being radio-quiet) and actually outflowing at
mildly relativistic speeds. Aberration reduces the irradiation of the disc,
thus forcing a lower than standard reflection fraction, and halves the inferred
source intrinsic luminosity, reducing the derived Eddington ratio from ~1to
~0.5. [abridged]

problem for equations of this type is in general ill-posed in the $C^0$-uniform
sense, if $s<\frac{2j-1}{2r'}$. The results for $r=2$ - so far in the

of the $j$th equation in $H^s(\R)$ for $s\ge\frac{j+1}{2}$, if $j$ is odd, and
for $s\ge\frac{j}{2}$, if $j$ is even. - The Cauchy problem for the $j$th
equation in the KdV hierarchy with data in $\hat{H}^r_s(\R)$ cannot be solved
by Picard iteration, if $r> \frac{2j}{2j-1}$, independent of the size of $s\in
\R$. Especially for $j\ge 2$ we have $C^2$-ill-posedness in $H^s(\R)$. With
similar arguments as used before in the mKdV context it is shown that this
problem is locally well-posed in $\hat{H}^r_s(\R)$, if $1<r\le \frac{2j}{2j-1}$
and $s > j - \frac32 - \frac{1}{2j} +\frac{2j-1}{2r'}$. For KdV itself the
lower bound on $s$ is pushed further down to
$s>\max{(-\frac12-\frac{1}{2r'},-\frac14-\frac{11}{8r'})}$, where $r\in (1,2)$.
These results rely on the contraction mapping principle, and the flow map is
real analytic.

the most active sunspot zones on the photosphere. Sunspot data has been
analyzed for 12 solar cycles (cycles 12-23) separately for northern and
southern hemisphere, and the entire solar sphere. The timelongitude diagrams
and their corresponding histograms have been plotted to probe the formation,
location, longitudinal spread, and lifetime of the most active sunspot
longitudes. By the analysis and comparison of the time- longitude diagrams and
histograms six active longitudes (>0, ~90, ~135, ~180, ~270 and <360 degrees)
have been identified out of which three (~90, ~180 and ~270 degrees) are
observed to be most frequent for the whole dataset analyzed. The comparison of
the northern and southern hemisphere revealed that the hemispheres do not
exhibit very similar kind of behavior. The lifetime and longitudinal spread of
sunspot active longitudes is found to be 3-5 Carrington rotations and 20-30
degrees Carrington longitude respectively. This research work also includes the
study of the movement of most active sunspot longitudes from higher to lower
latitudes in northern hemispheres for six solar cycles (cycles 18-23). For this
purpose the formation of sunspot active longitudes has been investigated in
four latitudinal belts (40-30, 30-20, 20-10 and 10-0 degrees)). It is found
that the sunspot active longitudes follow a certain longitudinal pattern during
the evolution of the 11-year solar cycle. In the beginning of a solar cycle
they seem to appear mostly around two longitudes ~0 degree and ~270 degrees in
the latitudinal belt 40-30 degrees. As the solar cycle proceeds they tend to be
stable around two longitudes ~90 degrees and ~270 degrees which are antipodal.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from accreting neutron stars vary with
frequency. Similarly, the QPO frequency varies with the source count rate (S).
Hence, the significance of a QPO, scaling as S x Rs^2/W^(1/2) will also depend
on frequency. In addition, the significance also scales up with the square root
of the integration time of the Fourier power density spectrum (T).
Consequently, depending on the way data are considered, kHz QPOs may be
detected only over a limited range of their frequency spans or detected
predominantly at some frequencies, leading potentially to biases in the
observed distributions of frequencies or frequency ratios. Although subject of
much controversy, an observed clustering of QPO frequency ratios around 3/2 in
Sco X-1, also seen in other sources, has been previously used as an argument
supporting resonance based models of neutron star QPOs. In this paper, we
measure how the statistical significance of both kHz QPOs vary with frequency
for three prototype neutron star kHz QPO sources, namely 4U1636-536, 4U0614+091
and Sco X-1. As the significance of QPO detection depends on frequency, we show
that in sensitivity-limited observations (as in the case of the RXTE/PCA), a
simultaneous detection of both the lower and upper kHz QPOs can only be
achieved over limited frequency ranges. As a result, even a uniform
distribution of QPO frequencies will lead to peaks (in particular around 3/2)
in the histogram of frequency ratios. This implies that the observed clustering
of ratios does not provide any evidence for intrinsically preferred frequency
ratios, thus weakening the case for a resonance mechanism at the origin of
neutron star kHz QPOs.

systems where the accretion flow is truncated by the magnetosphere. PDS of
accreting X-ray pulsars where the neutron star is close to the corotation with
the accretion disk at the magnetospheric boundary, have a distinct break/cutoff
at the neutron star spin frequency. This break can naturally be explained in
the ""perturbation propagation"" model, which assumes that at any given radius in
the accretion disk stochastic perturbations are introduced to the flow with
frequencies characteristic for this radius. These perturbations are then
advected to the region of main energy release leading to a self-similar
variability of X-ray flux P~f^{-1...-1.5}. The break in the PDS is then a
natural manifestation of the transition from the disk to magnetospheric flow at
the frequency characteristic for the accretion disk truncation radius
(magnetospheric radius). The proximity of the PDS break frequency to the spin
frequency in corotating pulsars strongly suggests that the typical variability
time scale in accretion disks is close to the Keplerian one. In transient
accreting X-ray pulsars characterized by large variations of the mass accretion
rate during outbursts, the PDS break frequency follows the variations of the
X-ray flux, reflecting the change of the magnetosphere size with the accretion
rate. Above the break frequency the PDS steepens to ~f^{-2} law which holds
over a broad frequency range. These results suggest that strong f^{-1...-1.5}
aperiodic variability which is ubiquitous in accretion disks is not
characteristic for magnetospheric flows.

the timescales of amplification and ordering of magnetic fields in disk and
puffy galaxies. Galaxies similar to the Milky Way formed their disks at
$z\approx10$ and regular fields of $\mu$G strength and a few kpc coherence
length were generated within 2 Gyr (at $z\approx3$), but field ordering up to
the coherence scale of the galaxy size took another 6 Gyr (at $z\approx0.5$).
Giant galaxies formed their disk already at $z\approx10$, allowing more
efficient dynamo generation of strong regular fields (with kpc coherence
length) already at $z\approx4$. Dwarf galaxies should have hosted fully
coherent fields at $z\approx1$. This evolutionary scenario and number of
predictions of the model can be tested by measurements of polarized synchrotron
emission and Faraday rotation with the planned Square Kilometre Array. This
model is used to simulate the evolution of regular fields in disk galaxies and

somewhat on the geometry of the oscillating object because the flow velocity at

more detailed analysis derived from the dynamics of the turbulent state gives
v_c \approx \sqrt{8\kappa\omega/\beta}, where \beta \sim 1 depends on the

kinematic quantities for 32360 calibration stars from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) and its first extension, (SDSS-II), which included the sub-survey
SEGUE: Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration. Full space
motions for a sub-sample of 16920 stars, exploring a local volume within 4 kpc
of the Sun, are used to derive velocity ellipsoids for the inner- and
outer-halo components of the Galaxy, as well as for the canonical thick-disk
and proposed metal-weak thick-disk populations. We first examine the question
of whether the data require the presence of at least a two-component halo in
order to account for the rotational behavior of likely halo stars in the local
volume, and whether more than two components are needed. We also address the
question of whether the proposed metal-weak thick disk is kinematically and
chemically distinct from the canonical thick disk. In addition, we consider the
fractions of each component required to understand the nature of the observed
kinematic behavior of the stellar populations of the Galaxy as a function of
distance from the plane. Scale lengths and scale heights for the thick-disk and
metal-weak thick-disk components are determined. Spatial density profiles for
the inner- and outer-halo populations are inferred from a Jeans Theorem
analysis. The full set of calibration stars (including those outside the local
volume) is used to test for the expected changes in the observed stellar
metallicity distribution function with distance above the Galactic plane
in-situ, due to the changing contributions from the underlying stellar
populations. [abridged]

  The goal of this paper is to determine the homotopy of the operadic mapping
spaces Map(E_n,C) with a cofibrant E_n-operad on the source and the commutative
operad on the target. First, we prove that the homotopy class of a morphism
phi: E_n -> C is uniquely determined by a multiplicative constant which gives
the action of phi on generating operations in homology. From this result, we
deduce that the connected components of Map(E_n,C) are in bijection with the
ground ring. Then we prove that each of these connected components is
contractible.
  In the case where n is infinite, we deduce from our results that the space of
homotopy self-equivalences of an E-infinity-operad in differential graded

photometry are distributed around but mostly below the characteristic
Schechter-fit mass. From HST/ACS images we determine morphologies and
structural parameters like disk length, position angle and ellipticity.
Combining the spectra of three slit positions per galaxy using the MXU mode of
VLT/FORS2 we construct the two-dimensional velocity field from gas emission
lines for 16 cluster members and 33 field galaxies. The kinematic position
angle and flatness are derived by a Fourier expansion of elliptical velocity
profiles. To trace possible interaction processes, we define three irregularity
indicators based on an identical analysis of local galaxies from the SINGS
project. Our distant sample displays a higher fraction of disturbed velocity
fields with varying percentages (10%, 30% and 70%) because they trace different
features. While we find far fewer candidates for major mergers than the SINS
sample at z~2, our data are sensitive enough to trace less violent processes.
Most irregular signatures are related to star formation events and less massive
disks are affected more than Milky-Way type objects. We detect similarly high
fractions of irregular objects both for the distant field and cluster galaxies
with similar distributions. We conclude that we may witness the building-up of
disk galaxies still at redshifts z~0.5 via minor mergers and gas accretion,

star formation histories (SFHs) for stars contained in HI holes from two
independent holes catalogs, as well as select control fields, i.e., similar
sized regions that span a range of HI column densities. Converting the recent
SFHs into stellar feedback energies, we find that enough energy has been
generated to have created all holes. However, the required energy is not always
produced over a time scale that is less than the estimated kinematic age of the
hole. The combination of the CMDs, recent SFHs, and locations of young stars
shows that the stellar populations inside HI holes are not coherent,
single-aged, stellar clusters, as previously suggested, but rather multi-age
populations distributed across each hole. From a comparison of the modeled and
observed integrated magnitudes, and the locations and energetics of stars
inside of HI holes, we propose a potential new model: a viable mechanism for
creating the observed HI holes in Ho II is stellar feedback from multiple
generations of SF spread out over tens or hundreds of Myr, and thus, the
concept of an age for an HI hole is intrinsically ambiguous. We further find
that \halpha and 24 micron emission, tracers of the most recent star formation,
do not correlate well with the positions of the HI holes. However, UV emission,
which traces star formation over roughly the last 100 Myr, shows a much better
correlation with the locations of the HI holes.

random networks of springs as model systems. An effective medium approximation
is made to compute the density of states of the vibrational modes, their energy
diffusivity (a spectral measure of transport) and their spatial correlations as
the network coordination $z$ is varied. Critical behaviors are obtained as
$z\to z_c$ where these networks lose rigidity. A sharp cross-over from a regime
where modes are plane-wave-like toward a regime of extended but
strongly-scattered modes occurs at some frequency $\omega^*\sim z-z_c$, which
does not correspond to the Ioffe-Regel criterion. Above $\omega^*$ both the
density of states and the diffusivity are nearly constant. These results agree
remarkably with recent numerical observations of repulsive particles near the
jamming threshold \cite{ning}. The analysis further predicts that the length
scale characterizing the correlation of displacements of the scattered modes
decays as $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ with frequency, whereas for $\omega<<\omega^*$
Rayleigh scattering is found with a scattering length $l_s\sim
(z-z_c)^3/\omega^4$. It is argued that this description applies to silica glass

ultrasound propagation in granular matter.

closed-shell 56Ni and 48Ca isotopes. It is found that large model spaces
(beyond the capability of shell-model applications) are necessary for
predicting the quenchings of spectroscopic factors.
  The particle-vibration coupling is identified as the principal mechanism.
Additional correlations--due to configuration with several particle-hole
excitations--are estimated using shell-model calculations and generate an extra
reduction which is < ~4% for most quasiparticle states. The theoretical
calculations nicely agree with (e,e'p) and heavy ion knock-out experiments.
These results open a new path for a microscopic understanding of the
shell-model.

field leads to buoyancy instabilities for any nonzero temperature gradient. We
study analogous instabilities in degenerate {\it collisional} plasmas, i.e.,
when the electron collision frequency is large compared to the electron
cyclotron frequency. Although heat conduction is nearly isotropic in this
limit, the small residual anisotropy ensures that collisional degenerate
plasmas are also convectively unstable independent of the sign of the
temperature gradient. We show that the range of wavelengths that are unstable
is independent of the magnetic field strength, while the growth time increases
with decreasing magnetic field strength. We discuss the application of these
collisional buoyancy instabilities to white dwarfs and neutron stars. Magnetic
tension and the low specific heat of a degenerate plasma significantly limit
their effectiveness; the most promising venues for growth are in the liquid
oceans of young, weakly magnetized neutron stars ($B \lesssim 10^9$ G) and in
the cores of young, high magnetic field white dwarfs ($B \sim 10^9$ G).

Our main results are twofold: First, we extend the recent blowup result of

Hartree-Fock equations with infinite rank solutions and a general class of

blowup for spherically symmetric solutions of a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov model,
where an angular momentum cutoff is introduced. We also explain the key
difficulties encountered in the full Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory.

significant obscuration by surrounding dust and gas. X-ray surveys in the 2-10
keV band will miss the most heavily-obscured AGN in which the absorbing column
density exceeds $\sim10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$ (the Compton-thick AGN). It is therefore
vital to know the fraction of AGN that are missed in such X-rays surveys and to
determine if these AGN represent some distinct population in terms of the
fundamental properties of AGN and/or their host galaxies. In this paper we
present the analysis of \textit{XMM-Newton} X-ray data for a complete sample of
17 low-redshift Type 2 Seyfert galaxies chosen from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey based solely on the high observed flux of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007
emission-line. This line is formed in the Narrow Line Region hundreds of
parsecs away from the central engine. Thus, unlike the X-ray emission, it is
not affected by obscuration due to the torus surrounding the black hole. It
therefore provides a useful isotropic indicator of the AGN luminosity. As
additional indicators of the intrinsic AGN luminosity, we use the Spitzer Space
Telescope to measure the luminosities of the mid-infrared continuum and the
[OIV]25.89$\mu$m narrow emission-line. We then use the ratio of the 2-10 keV
X-ray luminosity to the [OIII], [OIV], and mid-infrared luminosities to assess
the amount of X-ray obscuration and to distinguish between Compton-thick and
Compton-thin objects. We find that the majority of the sources suffer
significant amounts of obscuration: the observed 2-10 keV emission is depressed
by more than an order-of-magnitude in 11 of the 17 cases (as expected for
Compton-thick sources).

  Meson solution modified, baryon solution added",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bound states poles in scattering amplitudes are generated by the divergence
of the perturbative series due to enhanced Coulomb scattering near thresholds.
This suggests to organize bound state calculations according to an expansion in
hbar, i.e., in the number of loops. I study QED and QCD bound states at lowest
order in hbar, which are analogous to Born amplitudes. The absence of loops
allows the use of retarded boundary conditions where particles only propagate
forward in time, making a hamiltonian approach feasible. The instantaneous A^0
field is determined by the equations of motion separately for each Fock
component of the bound state. The field equations are compatible with a linear
A^0 potential as a homogeneous, non-perturbative solution. Stationarity of the
action determines the direction of the ensuing constant electric field in each
Fock state. Applying this approach to relativistic qqbar and qqq states in QCD
results in a bound state equation which provides a reasonable description of
the spectrum, including linear Regge trajectories. The equal-time wave
functions have unique Lorentz transformation properties, which ensure the
correct dependence of the bound state energy on the center-of-mass momentum.
The qqq potential is gauge covariant and confines the three quarks in a
symmetric way.
