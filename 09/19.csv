de Sitter space, by favoring the nucleation of black holes. The pair-production
rate given by the Euclidean action for the instanton takes the form exp(Delta

the Gauss-Bonnet term in the action sets a stability bound on the curvature of
empty de Sitter space. For that coefficient in the low-energy effective action
of heterotic string theory, the maximal curvature of de Sitter space is in
general much lower than the Planck scale.

over more than 10^5 supergranular cells, we find a ~ 0.1% decrease in red and

The radial intensity profile may be caused either by the thermal signal
associated with the supergranular flows or a variation in the packing density

New goods and services are endogenously produced through combinations of

already existing goods, in other words new products can have destructive
effects on existing goods. As a result of this competition mechanism existing
goods may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary
defects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic
dynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by
phases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as
Schumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and
productivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long
timescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed
distributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open,
non-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical
system. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology

sparse data sets in which strong localizations of CR* directions are not yet

assumed spatial distribution and luminosity function of the cosmic-ray sources.
We suggest that an indication of the source size is quite telling. For example,
an indication of the source size can be used to infer limits on the particle
charge and intervening magnetic fields (not independently), both of which are
not well constrained so far. This is possible because the source size is
similar in scale to the magnetic deflection.

from the powerful gamma-ray quasar PKS 1510-089, during a pointing centered on
the Galactic Center region from 1 March to 30 March 2008. This source has been
continuosly monitored in the radio-to-optical bands by the GLAST-AGILE Support
Program (GASP) of the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). Moreover, the
gamma-ray flaring episode triggered three ToO observations by the Swift
satellite in three consecutive days, starting from 20 March 2008. In the period
1-16 March 2008, AGILE detected gamma-ray emission from PKS 1510-089 at a
significance level of 6.2-sigma with an average flux over the entire period of
(84 +/- 17) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} for photon energies above 100 MeV.
After a predefined satellite re-pointing, between 17 and 21 March 2008, AGILE
detected the source at a significance level of 7.3-sigma, with an average flux
(E > 100 MeV) of (134 +/- 29) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} and a peak level
of (281 +/- 68) x 10^{-8} photons cm^{-2} s^{-1} with daily integration. During
the observing period January-April 2008, the source also showed an intense and
variable optical activity, with several flaring episodes and a significant
increase of the flux was observed at millimetric frequencies. Moreover, in the
X-ray band the Swift/XRT observations seem to show an harder-when-brighter
behaviour of the source spectrum. The spectral energy distribution of mid-March
2008 is modelled with a homogeneous one-zone synchrotron self Compton emission
plus contributions from inverse Compton scattering of external photons from
both the accretion disc and the broad line region. Indeed, some features in the
optical-UV spectrum seem to indicate the presence of Seyfert-like components,
such as the little blue bump and the big blue bump.

halo at least ~ 200 times more massive than its visible baryon mass of only ~
103 solar masses. The baryon mass is dominated by stars with perhaps an
interstellar gas mass of < 13 solar masses. Regarding Segue 1 as a dwarf disc
galaxy by its morphological appearance of long stretch, we invoke the dynamic
model of Xiang-Gruess, Lou & Duschl (XLD) to estimate its physical parameters
for possible equilibria with and without an isopedically magnetized gas disc.
We estimate the range of DM mass and compare it with available observational
inferences. Due to the relatively high stellar velocity dispersion compared to
the stellar surface mass density, we find that a massive DM halo would be
necessary to sustain disc equilibria. The required DM halo mass agrees grossly
with observational inferences so far. For an isopedic magnetic field in a gas
disc, the ratio f between the DM and baryon potentials depends strongly on the
magnetic field strength. Therefore, a massive DM halo is needed to counteract
either the strong stellar velocity dispersion and rotation of the stellar disc
or the magnetic Lorentz force in the gas disc. By the radial force balances,
the DM halo mass increases for faster disc rotation.

per comet. The data has been reduced homogeneously. Our overriding goal is to
learn the properties of the ensemble of comets. More than 30 parameters are
listed, of which over ~20 are new and measured from the plots. We define two
ages for a comet using activity as a proxy, the photometric age P-AGE, and the
time-age, T-AGE. It is shown that these two parameters are robust, implying
that the input data can have significant errors but P-AGE and T-AGE come out
with small errors. This is due to their mathematical definition. It is shown
that P-AGE classifies comets by shape of their light curve. The value of this
Atlas is twofold: The SLCs not only show what we know, but also show what we do
not know, thus pointing the way to meaningful observations. Besides their
scientific value, these plots are useful for planning observations. The SLCs
have not been modeled, and there is no cometary light curve standard model as
there is for some variable stars (i.e. eclipsing binaries). Comets are
classified by age and size. In this way it is found that
29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 is a baby goliath comet, while C/1983 J1
Sugano-Saigusa-Fujikawa is a middle age dwarf. There are new classes of comets
based on their photometric properties. The secular light curves presented in

While
this process is simple for fitness landscapes where mutations are independent,
the interaction between mutations (epistasis) as well as mutations at loci that
affect more than one trait (pleiotropy) are crucial in complex and realistic
fitness landscapes. We investigate the impact of epistasis and pleiotropy on
adaptive evolution by studying the evolution of a population of asexual haploid
organisms (haplotypes) in a model of N interacting loci, where each locus
interacts with K other loci. We use a quantitative measure of the magnitude of
epistatic interactions between substitutions, and find that it is an increasing
function of K. When haplotypes adapt at high mutation rates, more epistatic
pairs of substitutions are observed on the line of descent than expected. The
highest fitness is attained in landscapes with an intermediate amount of
ruggedness that balance the higher fitness potential of interacting genes with
their concomitant decreased evolvability. Our findings imply that the synergism
between loci that interact epistatically is crucial for evolving genetic
modules with high fitness, while too much ruggedness stalls the adaptive
process.

in the statistics community under the name ""group testing"", a problem which
dates back to World War II when it was suggested for syphilis screening. There
the main interest is to identify a small number of infected people among a
large population using collective samples. In viral epidemics, one way to
acquire collective samples is by sending agents inside the population. While in
classical group testing, it is assumed that the sampling procedure is fully
known to the reconstruction algorithm, in this work we assume that the decoder
possesses only partial knowledge about the sampling process. This assumption is
justified by observing the fact that in a viral sickness, there is a chance
that an agent remains healthy despite having contact with an infected person.
Therefore, the reconstruction method has to cope with two different types of
uncertainty; namely, identification of the infected population and the
partially unknown sampling procedure.
  In this work, by using a natural probabilistic model for ""viral infections"",
we design non-adaptive sampling procedures that allow successful identification
of the infected population with overwhelming probability 1-o(1). We propose
both probabilistic and explicit design procedures that require a ""small"" number
of agents to single out the infected individuals. More precisely, for a
contamination probability p, the number of agents required by the probabilistic
and explicit designs for identification of up to k infected members is bounded
by m = O(k^2 (log n)/p^2) and m = O(k^2 (log n)^2 /p^2), respectively. In both
cases, a simple decoder is able to successfully identify the infected
population in time O(mn).

the disc, following the formation of the bar. We associate these velocity
streams with two quasi-periodic orbital families, librating around the stable
x_1(1) and x_1(2) orbits near the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). In a
reference frame moving with the bar, these otherwise stationary orbits precess
on a timescale dependent on the strength of the bar, consistent with
predictions from a simple Hamiltonian model for the resonance. This behavior
allows the two orbital families to reach the solar neighborhood and manifest
themselves as clumps in the u-v plane moving away from (x_1(2)), and toward
(x_1(1)) the Galactic center. Depending on the bar parameters and time since
its formation, this model is consistent with the Pleiades and Coma Berenices,
or Pleiades and Sirius moving groups seen in the Hipparcos stellar velocity
distribution, if the Milky Way bar angle is 30<phi_0<45 [deg] and its pattern
speed is Omega_b/Omega_0=1.82\pm 0.07, where Omega_0 is the angular velocity of
the local standard of rest (LSR). Since the process is recurrent, we can
achieve a good match about every six LSR rotations. However, to be consistent
with the fraction of stars in the Pleiades, we estimate that the Milky Way bar
formed ~2 Gyr ago. This model argues against a common dynamical origin for the
Hyades and Pleiades moving groups.

scattering. We show how to reduce this problem to a quantum field theory
computation in a classical background (gravitational shock wave). In momentum
space, the formalism is similar to the flat-space light cone perturbation
theory, with shock wave crossing vertices added. In the impact parameter
representation, the radiating particle splits into a multi-particle virtual
state, whose wavefunction is then multiplied by individual eikonal factors. As
a phenomenological application, we study QCD radiation in transplanckian
collisions of TeV-scale gravity models. We derive the distribution of initial
state radiation gluons, and find a suppression at large transverse momenta with
respect to the standard QCD result. This is due to rescattering events, in
which the quark and the emitted gluon scatter coherently. Interestingly, the
suppression factor depends on the number of extra dimensions and provides a new
experimental handle to measure this number. We evaluate the leading-log
corrections to partonic cross-sections due to the initial state radiation, and
prove that they can be absorbed into the hadronic PDF. The factorization scale
should then be chosen in agreement with an earlier proposal of Emparan, Masip,
and Rattazzi. In the future, our methods can be applied to the gravitational
radiation in transplanckian scattering, where they can go beyond the existing
approaches limited to the soft radiation case.

functions. We find a marked star formation-radius relation in that almost all
galaxies in the cluster core are quiescent, i.e. have terminated star formation
a few Gyr ago. This star formation-radius relation is most pronounced for
low-mass galaxies and is very weak or absent beyond the virial radius. The
typical star formation rate of non-quiescent galaxies declines by approximately
a factor of two towards the cluster center. However, the fraction of galaxies
with young stellar populations indicating a recently completed starburst or a
truncation of star formation does not vary significantly with radius. The
fraction of star-forming galaxies which host a powerful optical AGN is also
independent of clustercentric radius, indicating that the link between star
formation and AGN in these galaxies operates independent of environment. The
fraction of red galaxies which host a weak optical AGN decreases, however,
towards the cluster center, with a similar timescale as the decline of star
forming galaxies. Our results favor a scenario in which star formation is
quenched slowly, on timescales similar to the cluster crossing time, and rule
out significant contributions from more violent processes at least beyond

that there is an effective description of the physics in terms of a Luttinger

zero sound mode is found. The thermodynamic aspects of these models are
considered carefully and certain subtleties with boundary terms are explained
which are unique to 1+1 dimensions. Spectral functions of bosonic and fermionic

in the lensing cluster Abell 611 (z=0.288), with the goal of determining the
dark matter profile over an unprecedented range of cluster-centric distance. By
combining three complementary probes of the mass distribution, weak lensing
from deep multi-color imaging, strong lensing constraints based on the
identification of multiply-imaged sources, and resolved stellar velocity
dispersion measures for the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), we extend the
methodology for separating the dark and baryonic mass components introduced by
Sand et al. (2008). Our resulting dark matter profile samples the cluster from
~3 kpc to 3.25 Mpc, thereby providing an excellent basis for comparisons with
recent numerical models. We demonstrate that only by combining our three
observational techniques can degeneracies in constraining the form of the dark
matter profile be broken on scales crucial for detailed comparisons with
numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals that a simple Navarro, Frenk, and
White (NFW) profile is an unacceptable fit to our data. We confirm earlier
claims that the inner profile of the dark matter profile deviates significantly
from the NFW form and find a inner logarithmic slope \beta flatter than 0.3
(68%; where rho_DM ~ r^{-\beta} at small radii). In order to reconcile our data
with cluster formation in a LambdaCDM cosmology, we speculate that it may be
necessary to revise our understanding of the nature of baryon--dark matter
interactions in cluster cores. Comprehensive weak and strong lensing data, when
coupled with kinematic information on the brightest cluster galaxy, can readily
be applied to a larger sample of clusters to test the universality of these
results.

pairwise comparisons of a given set of proposals by as few as referees as

referees are sufficient to cover all n(n-1)/2 pairs of n proposals. While the
upper bound remains within a factor of 2 of the lower bound, it becomes
relatively large for small values of k and the ratio of the upper bound to the
lower bound is not less than 3/2 when 2 <= k <= n/2. In this paper, we show
that, if sqrt(n) <= k <= n/2 then the upper and lower bounds can be made closer
in that their ratio never exceeds 3/2. This is accomplished by a new method
that assigns proposals to referees using a particular family of balanced
incomplete block designs. Specifically, the new method uses ceil{n(n+k)/k^2}
referees when n/k is a prime power, n divides k^2, and sqrt(n) <= k <= n/2.
Comparing this new upper bound to the one given in [8] shows that the new upper
bound approaches the lower bound as k tends to sqrt(n) whereas the upper bound
in [8] approaches the lower bound as k tends to n. Therefore, the new method
given here when combined together with the one in [8] provides an assignment
whose upper bound referee complexity always remains within a factor of 3/2 of
the lower bound when sqrt(n) <= k <= n, thereby improving upon the assignment
described in [8]. Furthermore, the new method provides a minimal covering,
i.e., it uses the minimum number of referees possible when k = sqrt(n) and k is

These objects are interpreted as young supernovae and supernova remnants; the
ratio of the source counts in nuclei A and B1 is approximately equal to the
ratio of their predicted supernova rates. An approximate luminosity function
has been derived for nucleus A, and indicates that it might contain as many as
500-1000 compact radio sources more powerful than Cas A; the integrated flux
density of these sources would be about 20% of the total flux density seen at
lower resolution. A new supernova occurred in nucleus B1 in the first half of
2005, having a peak radio power at least 2,000 times the present power of
Cassiopeia A. This supernova is located within 0.4 pc (projected distance) of
an apparently older supernova remnant, making it very likely that this
indicates the presence of a massive super star cluster within nucleus B1.

nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 measurements on a single crystal.
This compound exhibits long-range antiferromagnetic order below TN \simeq 3.65
K. NMR spectra above TN show two distinct lines corresponding to two
inequivalent P sites present in the crystal structure. The observed asymmetry
in hyperfine coupling constant for the in-plane (P1) P site directly points
towards a distortion in the square lattice at the microscopic level, consistent
with the monoclinic crystal structure. The nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor
exchange couplings were estimated to be J1/kB = (-5.4 \pm 0.5) K
(ferromagnetic) and J2/kB = (9.3 \pm 0.6) K (antiferromagnetic), respectively.
1/(T1 T chi) is almost T-independent at high temperatures due to random
fluctuation of spin moments. Below 20 K, the compound shows an enhancement of
1/(T1 T chi) which arises from a growth of antiferromagnetic spin correlations
above TN. Below TN and for the field applied along the c-axis, the NMR spectrum
for the P1 site splits into two satellites and the spacing between them
increases monotonically with decreasing T which is a direct evidence of a
columnar antiferromagnetic ordering with spins lying in the ab-plane. This type
of magnetic ordering is consistent with expectation from the J2/J1 \simeq -1.72
ratio. The critical exponent beta = 0.25 \pm 0.02 estimated from the

arXiv:0901.3775. Also, we show that our model is a generalization of the
conformal mechanics of Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan. For arbitrary $z$ we
construct the dynamical symmetries that correspond to the Schroedinger algebra.
Furthermore, we obtain the Boltzman distribution for a gas of free particles
compatible with anisotropic scaling transformations and compare our result with
the corresponding thermodynamics of the recent anisotropic black branes

with effective mass and spin susceptibility varying logarithmically with
energy/temperature, as observed in experiment. We find a sharp ESR resonance
line slightly shifted from the local f-level resonance and broadened by
quasiparticle scattering (taking unequal g-factors of conduction and f
electrons) and by spin-lattice relaxation, both significantly reduced by the
effect of ferromagnetic fluctuations. A detailed comparison of our theory with

in the related material NaxCoO2, a magnetic critical point is found to exist

obscuration by dust in the disk of our Galaxy. The degree of obscuration is
wavelength dependent. It decreases towards longer wavelengths. Compared to the
optical, the Near InfraRed (NIR) $K_s$ band extinction is only $\approx10%$
that of the $B$ band. This makes NIR surveys well suited for galaxy surveys
close to the Galactic Plane where extinction is severe.
  While Galactic obscuration is less prominent in the NIR it is not negligible.
In this paper we derive empirical relations to correct isophotal radii and
magnitudes of galaxies observed in the NIR for foreground absorption. We
simulate extinction in the $J$, $H$ and $K_s$ bands on 64 (unobscured) galaxies
from the 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas \citep{jarrett}. We propose two methods for
the extinction correction, the first is optimized to provide the most accurate
correction and the second provides a convenient statistical correction that
works adequately in lower extinction regions. The optimized correction utilizes
the galaxy surface brightness, either the disk central surface brightness,
$\mu_0$, or the combined disk plus bulge central surface brightness, elliptical
and disk/spiral Hubble types. A detailed comparison between the different
methods and their accuracy is provided.

oscillations occur close to the regions of maximum magnetic field curvature,
that is, close to the magnetic poles where the majority of magnetic flux
emerges. Given that these oscillations have a density-dependent maximum
amplitude before wave-breaking occurs, such waves can eject energetic electrons
using only the self-field of the electron population in the interior. Moreover,
photons emitted by electrons in the bulk of the oscillation can escape along
the field lines by virtue of the lower opacity there (and the fact that they
are emitted predominantly in this direction), leading to features in the

young pulsars using data from the fifth science run of the LIGO detectors. For
this search ephemerides overlapping the run period were obtained for all
pulsars using radio and X-ray observations. We demonstrate an updated search
method that allows for small uncertainties in the pulsar phase parameters to be
included in the search. We report no signal detection from any of the targets
and therefore interpret our results as upper limits on the gravitational wave
signal strength. The most interesting limits are those for young pulsars. We
present updated limits on gravitational radiation from the Crab pulsar, where
the measured limit is now a factor of seven below the spin-down limit. This
limits the power radiated via gravitational waves to be less than ~2% of the
available spin-down power. For the X-ray pulsar J0537-6910 we reach the
spin-down limit under the assumption that any gravitational wave signal from it
stays phase locked to the X-ray pulses over timing glitches, and for pulsars
J1913+1011 and J1952+3252 we are only a factor of a few above the spin-down
limit. Of the recycled millisecond pulsars several of the measured upper limits
are only about an order of magnitude above their spin-down limits. For these
our best (lowest) upper limit on gravitational wave amplitude is 2.3x10^-26 for
J1603-7202 and our best (lowest) limit on the inferred pulsar ellipticity is
7.0x10^-8 for J2124-3358.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200810471",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We aimed at finding a physical explanation for the occurrence of
macroturbulence in the atmospheres of hot massive stars, a phenomenon found in
observations since more than a decade but yet unexplained. We computed time
series of line profiles for evolved massive stars broadened by rotation and by
hundreds of low-amplitude nonradial gravity-mode pulsations which are predicted
to be excited for evolved massive stars. In general, line profiles based on
macrotubulent broadening can mimic those subject to pulsational broadening. In
several cases, though, good fits require macroturbulent velocities that pass
the speed of sound for realistic pulsation amplitudes. Moreover, we find that
the rotation velocity can be seriously underestimated by using a simple
parameter description for macroturbulence rather than an appropriate
pulsational model description to fit the line profiles. We conclude that
macroturbulence is a likely signature of the collective effect of pulsations.
We provide line diagnostics and their typical values to decide whether or not
pulsational broadening is present in observed line profiles, as well as a
procedure to avoid an inaccurate estimation of the rotation velocity.

a linearization of Moffat's field equations based on the more rigorous Fermi
