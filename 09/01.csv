dimension reduction are two fundamental problems in the study of dynamical
systems with many degrees of freedom. For the latter extensive efforts have
been made but with limited success to generalize the Zwanzig-Mori projection
formalism, originally developed for Hamiltonian systems close to thermodynamic
equilibrium, to general non-Hamiltonian systems lacking detailed-balance. One
difficulty introduced by such systems is the lack of an invariant measure,
needed to define a statistical distribution. Based on a recent discovery that a
non-Hamiltonian system defined by a set of stochastic differential equations
can be mapped to a Hamiltonian system, we develop such general projection
formalism. In the resulting generalized Langevin equations, a set of
generalized fluctuation-dissipation relations connect the memory kernel and the
random noise terms, analogous to Hamiltonian systems obeying detailed balance.
Lacking of these relations restricts previous application of the generalized
Langevin formalism. Result of this work may serve as the theoretical basis for
further technical developments on model reconstruction with reduced degrees of
freedom. We first use an analytically solvable example to illustrate the
formalism and the fluctuation-dissipation relation. Our numerical test on a
chemical network with end-product inhibition further demonstrates the validity
of the formalism. We suggest that the formalism can find wide applications in
scientific modeling. Specifically, we discuss potential applications to
biological networks. In particular, the method provides a suitable framework
for gaining insights into network properties such as robustness and parameter
transferability.

cells. Recent experimental work has shown that MHC escape mutations form an
important pathway for HIV to avoid such selection. In this paper, we study a
model of MHC escape mutation. The model is a predator-prey model with two prey,
composed of two HIV variants, and one predator, the immune system CD8 cells. We
assume that one HIV variant is visible to CD8 cells and one is not. The model
takes the form of a system of stochastic differential equations. Motivated by
well-known results concerning the short life-cycle of HIV intrahost, we assume
that HIV population dynamics occur on a faster time scale then CD8 population
dynamics. This separation of time scales allows us to analyze our model using
an asymptotic approach.
  Using this model we study the impact of an MHC escape mutation on the
population dynamics and genetic evolution of the intrahost HIV population. From
the perspective of population dynamics, we show that the competition between
the visible and invisible HIV variants can reach steady states in which either
a single variant exists or in which coexistence occurs depending on the
parameter regime. We show that in some parameter regimes the end state of the
system is stochastic. From a genetics perspective, we study the impact of the
population dynamics on the lineages of HIV samples taken after an escape
mutation occurs. We show that the lineages go through severe bottlenecks and
that the lineage distribution can be characterized by a Kingman coalescent.

an inherently complete sample from an all-sky compilation (excluding a narrow

  The strategy is based on selecting candidate VHE blazars from a GeV-detected
blazar sample, namely the LAT-bright-AGN-sample (LBAS) of the Fermi Gamma-ray
Space Telescope (FGST). The intrinsic spectra in the VHE regime is estimated
based on the extrapolation of the GeV spectra measured with FGST. This is
corrected for the unavoidable extinction due to the Extragalactic Background
Light (EBL) in the UV to mid-IR. The resulting observable spectra ranked by the
integrated flux is used to extract candidates for observations in the VHE
regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The predictions
are cross-checked using the sample of known VHE blazars.

General Relativity is proposed. It assigns the coarse--grained expansion, shear
and vorticity to finite-size comoving domains of fluid in a covariant,
coordinate-independent manner. The coarse--grained quantities are all
quasi-local functionals, depending only on the geometry of the boundary of the
considered domain. They can be thought of as relativistic generalizations of
simple volume averages of local quantities in a flat space. The procedure is
based on the isometric embedding theorem for S^2 surfaces and thus requires the
boundary of the domain in question to have spherical topology and positive
scalar curvature. We prove that in the limit of infinitesimally small volume
the proposed quantities reproduce the local expansion, shear and vorticity. In
case of irrotational flow we derive the time evolution for the coarse-grained
quantities and show that its structure is very similar to the evolution
equation for their local counterparts. Additional terms appearing in it may
serve as a measure of the backreacton of small-scale inhomogeneities of the
flow on the large-scale motion of the fluid inside the domain and therefore the
result may be interesting in the context of the cosmological backreaction
problem. We also consider the application of the proposed coarse-graining
procedure to a number of known exact solutions of Einstein equations with dust

70% of our universe's energy density is in so called ""Dark Energy"" (DE).
Observations show that DE has negative effective pressure and therefore unlike
conventional energy sources accelerates the cosmic expansion instead of
decelerating it. DE is highly uniform and has become a dominant component only
recently.
  The simplest candidate for DE is the time-independent cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Although successful in fitting available data, the cosmological
constant model has a number of theoretical shortcomings and because of that
alternative models of DE are considered. In one such scenario a cosmological
scalar field that slowly rolls down its potential acts like a time-dependent
cosmological constant.

method is hampered by the fact that these stars are very faint at optical
wavelengths where the most high-precision spectrometers operate. We investigate
the precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low mass
stars in the near infrared (nIR) Y-, J-, and H-bands, and we compare it to the
precision achievable in the optical. For early-M stars, radial velocity
measurements in the nIR offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison to
optical measurements. Although they emit more flux in the nIR, the richness of
spectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. We find that
nIR measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars of
spectral type ~M4, and from there the nIR gains in precision towards cooler
objects. We studied potential calibration strategies in the nIR finding that a
stable spectrograph with a ThAr calibration can offer enough wavelength
stability for m/s precision. Furthermore, we simulate the wavelength-dependent
influence of activity (cool spots) on radial velocity measurements from optical
to nIR wavelengths. Our spot simulations reveal that the radial velocity jitter
does not decrease as dramatically towards longer wavelengths as often thought.
The jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spot
temperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. Forthcoming nIR
spectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage in
mid- and late-M stars. Activity will remain an issue, but simultaneous
observations at optical and nIR wavelengths can provide strong constraints on
spot properties in active stars.

to test whether recently merged haloes exhibit stronger large-scale clustering
than other haloes of the same mass. This effect could help to understand the
very strong clustering of quasars at high redshift. However, we find no
statistically significant excess bias for recently merged haloes over the
redshift range 2 < z < 5, with the most massive haloes showing an excess of at
most ~5%. We also consider galaxies extracted from a semianalytic model built
on the Millennium Simulation. At fixed stellar mass, we find an excess bias of
~ 20-30% for recently merged objects, decreasing with increasing stellar mass.
The fact that recently-merged galaxies are found in systematically more massive
haloes than other galaxies of the same stellar mass accounts for about half of
this signal, and perhaps more for high-mass galaxies. The weak merger bias of
massive systems suggests that objects of merger-driven nature, such as quasars,
do not cluster significantly differently than other objects of the same
characteristic mass. We discuss the implications of these results for the
interpretation of clustering data with respect to quasar duty cycles,
visibility times, and evolution in the black hole-host mass relation.

Our disks evolve subject to viscous transport of angular momentum and
photoevaporation, while planets undergo Type II migration. We use a Monte Carlo

We find that relatively simple models can reproduce both the observed radial
distribution of extra-solar giant planets, and the lifetimes and accretion
histories of protoplanetary disks. The use of state-of-the-art photoevaporation
models results in a degree of coupling between planet formation and disk
clearing, which has not been found previously. Some accretion across planetary
orbits is necessary if planets are to survive at radii <~1.5AU, and if planets
of Jupiter mass or greater are to survive in our models they must be able to
form at late times, when the disk surface density in the formation region is
low. Our model forms two different types of ""transitional"" disks, embedded
planets and clearing disks, which show markedly different properties. We find
that the observable properties of these systems are broadly consistent with
current observations, and highlight useful observational diagnostics. We
predict that young transition disks are more likely to contain embedded giant
planets, while older transition disks are more likely to be undergoing disk
clearing.

carried-out at the recently commissioned 2m telescope in IUCAA Girawali
Observatory, India. This AGN-like source is known to feature three sets of
emission lines at zem = 0.6972, 0.7020 and 0.7128. Different scenarios such as
a recoiling black hole after asymmetric emission of gravitational waves, binary
black holes and possible merging systems are proposed for this object. We test
these scenarios by comparing our spectra with that from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS), obtained 4 years prior to our observations. Comparing the
redshifts of [OIII]4960,5008 we put a 3 sigma limit on the relative
acceleration to be less than 32 km s^-1 yr^-1 between different emitting
regions. Using the 2D spectra obtained at different position angles we show
that the [OIII]5008 line from the zem = 0.7128 component is extended beyond the
spectral point spread function. We infer the linear extent of this line
emitting region is ~8 kpc. We also find a tentative evidence for an offset
between the centroid of the [OIII]5008 line at zem = 0.7128 and the QSO trace
when the slit is aligned at a position angle of 299 degrees. This corresponds
to the zem = 0.7128 system being at an impact parameter of ~1 kpc with respect
to the zem = 0.6972 in the north west direction. Based on our observations we
conclude that the binary black hole model is most unlikely. The spatial extent
and the sizes are consistent with both black hole recoil and merging scenarios.

unparticles (being bound states of fundamental fermions) are protected from
radiative corrections. Further, coupling of unparticles to the standard model

$M_F$, making the unparticle dark energy model free of most of the problems

distance estimate via the Flux-weighted Gravity--Luminosity Relationship
(FGLR). This result is based on an FGLR calibration that is continually being

variation ranging from 0.01 to 0.16 mag however, demonstrating the importance
of accurate individual reddening measurements for stellar distance indicators
in galaxies with evident signatures of interstellar absorption. The large
distance modulus found is in good agreement with recent work on eclipsing
binaries, planetary nebulae, long period variables, RR Lyrae stars, and also
with HST observations of Cepheids, if reasonable reddening assumptions are made
for the Cepheids. Since distances based on the tip of the red giant branch

HST ACS V- and I-band images of outer regions of M 33 to determine a TRGB

0.3 $Z_\odot$ in the outskirts at a distance of one isophotal radius. The

reproduce mass and width of the $\phi(1020)$, but come out reasonably close to

candidates for observed resonances, as well other ones that should exist

the disks are well modeled by a single dust temperature, possibly indicative of
a ring-like structure. However, a single dust temperature does not match the
data for other disks in the sample, implying a distribution of temperatures

transverse component of nuclear polarization. In a system repeatedly swept

when the channel is highly decohered. Two critical points corresponding to two
values of the entanglement angle are found in the presence of correlated noise.
Within the range of these limits of entanglement angle, the game is follower
advantage game. In case of depolarizing channel, the payoffs of the two firms
are strongly influenced by the memory parameter. The presence of quantum memory
ensures the existence of Nash equilibrium for the entire range of decoherence
and entanglement parameters for both the channels. A local maximum in the
payoffs is observed which vanishes as the channel correlation increases.
Moreover, under the influence of depolarizing channel, the game is always a
leader advantage game. Furthermore, it is seen that phase damping channel does

total mass $2 M_\odot < M < 15 M_\odot$. For eccentricities $e_0 \gtrsim 0.1$,
the loss in matched filter signal-to-noise ratio due to eccentricity can be
significant and so templates which include eccentric effects will be required

lowest significance sources (~4.6 sigma under an exposure of about 371 ks).
This leads to a caveat in multi-wavelength study although the source was
identified in optical as a Seyfert 1. The currently increased INTEGRAL data
stimulate us to investigate the reality of this source. We analyze all
available observations carried out by INTEGRAL and Swift on IGR J19405-3016. We
find that IGR J19405-3016 has a detection significance of ~ 9.4 sigma in the
20-60 keV band during the observational period between March 2003 and March
2008. Thus confirms a real source detection reported previously. The source
position and error location are therefore updated. The source is found to be
constant over years at the hard X-rays. Over the three XRT observations, the
source flux varied by up to 39% from the average, and the spectrum is generally
soft. The combined XRT/ISGRI spectrum is well fitted with a simple power law
model (photon index 2.11+-0.03). Such a photon index is well consistent with
the mean value 1.98 (dispersion 0.27) as obtained from Swift/BAT AGN samples at
14-195 keV. The spectral slope of IGR J19405-3016 is larger than the average
spectral slope found by Molina et al. (2009). A similar discrepancy is found
with the results of Beckmann et al. (2009) regarding Seyfert 1 AGNs. A possible
explanation of this simple spectral description may be that the low level of
the column density allows for the `true' spectrum to appear at soft X-rays as
well.

quantum system (in particular, between the actual evolution of an open system
and the ideal target operation on the corresponding closed system) is important
in quantum control, especially in control of quantum information processing.
Motivated by this problem, we develop a measure for evaluating the distance
between unitary evolution operators of a composite quantum system that consists
of a sub-system of interest (e.g., a quantum information processor) and
environment. The main characteristic of this measure is the invariance with
respect to the effect of the evolution operator on the environment, which
follows from an equivalence relation that exists between unitary operators
acting on the composite system, when the effect on only the sub-system of
interest is considered. The invariance to the environment's transformation
makes it possible to quantitatively compare the evolution of an open quantum
system and its closed counterpart. The distance measure also determines the
fidelity bounds of a general quantum channel (a completely positive and
trace-preserving map acting on the sub-system of interest) with respect to a
unitary target transformation. This measure is also independent of the initial
state of the system and straightforward to numerically calculate. As an
example, the measure is used in numerical simulations to evaluate fidelities of
optimally controlled quantum gate operations (for one- and two-qubit systems),
in the presence of a decohering environment. This example illustrates the
utility of this measure for optimal control of quantum operations in the
realistic case of open-system dynamics.

is also established. A deeper understanding of OMP may benefit the analysis of
greedy algorithms in general. To demonstrate this, we also briefly revisit the
analysis of the Regularized OMP (ROMP) algorithm.

based on the Location Aided Routing (LAR). EELAR makes significant reduction in
the energy consumption of the mobile nodes batteries by limiting the area of
discovering a new route to a smaller zone. Thus, control packets overhead is
significantly reduced. In EELAR a reference wireless base station is used and
the network's circular area centered at the base station is divided into six
equal sub-areas. At route discovery instead of flooding control packets to the
whole network area, they are flooded to only the sub-area of the destination
mobile node. The base station stores locations of the mobile nodes in a
position table. To show the efficiency of the proposed protocol we present
simulations using NS-2. Simulation results show that EELAR protocol makes an
improvement in control packet overhead and delivery ratio compared to AODV,

introducing a feedback transmission scheme as an inner code. In this paper,
this process is investigated for the case when a linear feedback scheme is
implemented as an inner code and, in particular, over an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with noisy feedback. To begin, we look to derive
an optimal linear feedback scheme by optimizing over the received
signal-to-noise ratio. From this optimization, an asymptotically optimal linear
feedback scheme is produced and compared to other well-known schemes. Then, the
linear feedback scheme is implemented as an inner code to a concatenated code
over the AWGN channel with noisy feedback. This code shows improvements not
only in error exponent bounds, but also in bit-error-rate and frame-error-rate.
It is also shown that the if the concatenated code has total blocklength L and
the inner code has blocklength, N, the inner code blocklength should scale as N
= O(C/R), where C is the capacity of the channel and R is the rate of the
concatenated code. Simulations with low density parity check (LDPC) and turbo

regime. In all environments, S0 galaxies show a faster evolution than
elliptical galaxies. For the cluster galaxies a slight radial dependence of the
evolution out to one virial radius is found. Dividing the samples with respect

models, based on the Jacobian matrix of a manipulator and only the rigidity of
the actuators, whenever its geometry is optimised. In many works, these
simplified models are used to propose optimal design of robots. However, the
elasticity of the drive system is often negligible in comparison with the
elasticity of the elements, especially in applications where high dynamic
performances are needed. Therefore, the use of such a simplified model may lead
to the creation of robots with long legs, which will be submitted to large
bending and twisting deformations. This paper presents an example of
manipulator for which it is preferable to use a complete stiffness or vibration
model to obtain the most suitable design and shows that the use of simplified
models can lead to mechanisms with poorer rigidity.

work studies the internal topological structure of bounded plane regions, which
could consist of multiple pieces and/or have holes and islands to any finite

closed under set operations and can closely approximate most plane regions

the galaxy from the nebular [OII] emission. Using a detailed gravitational lens

intrinsically L* galaxy has a stellar mass of M*=7+/-2x10^8Mo, a dynamical mass
of Mdyn=3+/-1x10^9csc^2(i)Mo (within of 2kpc) and a star-formation rate of
42+/-8Mo/yr. The source-plane UV/optical morphology of this galaxy is dominated
by five discrete star-forming regions. Exploiting the dynamical information we
derive masses for individual star-forming regions of Mcl~10^(8-9)Mo with sizes
of ~200pc. We find that, at a fixed size, the star-formation rate density
within these HII regions is approximately two orders of magnitude greater than
those observed in local spiral/starburst galaxies, but consistent with the most
massive HII regions in the local Universe such as 30Dor. Finally, we compare
the spatially resolved nebular emission line velocity with the Ly-alpha and
UV-ISM lines and find that this galaxy is surrounded by a galactic scale
outflow in which the Ly-alpha appears redshifted by ~150km/s and the UV-ISM
lines blue-shifted by -200km/s from the (systemic) nebular emission. The
velocity structure of the outflow mirrors that of the nebular emission
suggesting the outflow is young (~15Myr), and has yet to burst out of the

undergoing its first major epoch of mass assembly.

caustic, which represents the merging of the planetary and central caustics at
the position when the projected separation of a host star and a bounded planet
is s~1. One of the resonant caustic lensing events, OGLE-2005-BLG-169, was a
caustic-crossing high-magnification event with $A_{max} \sim$ 800 and the
source star was much smaller than the caustic, nevertheless the perturbation
was not obviously apparent on the light curve of the event. In this paper, we
investigate the perturbation pattern of the resonant caustic to understand why
the perturbations induced by the caustic do not leave strong traces on the
light curves of high-magnification events despite a small source/caustic size
ratio. From this study, we find that the regions with
small-magnification-excess around the center of the resonant caustic are rather
widely formed, and the event passing the small-excess region produces a
high-magnification event with a weak perturbation that is small relative to the
amplification caused by the star and thus does not noticeably appear on the
light curve of the event. We also find that the positive excess of the inside
edge of the resonant caustic and the negative excess inside the caustic become
stronger and wider as $q$ increases, and thus the resonant caustic-crossing
high-magnification events with the weak perturbation occur in the range of $q
\leqslant 10^{-4}$. We determine the probability of the occurrence of events
with the small excess $|\epsilon| \leqslant 3 %$ in high-magnification events
induced by a resonant caustic. As a result, we find that for the Earth-mass
planets with a separation of ~ 2.5 AU, the resonant caustic high-magnification
events with the weak perturbation can occur with a significant frequency.

density) is chaotic. This ""chaoticity"" would imply irregular coherent
oscillations of the whole society, that may eventually lead to a sudden jump
into an absorbing state, if present.
  However, simulations on regular one-dimensional lattices show a different
scenario: local patches may oscillate following the mean-field description, but
these oscillations are not correlated spatially, so the average magnetization
fluctuates around zero (average opinion near one half). The system is chaotic,
but in a microscopic sense where local fluctuations tend to compensate each
other.
  By varying the long-range rewiring of links, we trigger a small-world effect.
We observe a bifurcation diagram for the magnetization, with period doubling
cascades ending in a chaotic phase. As far as we know, this is the first
observation of a small-world induced bifurcation diagram.
  The social implications of this transition are also interesting. In the
presence of strong ""anticonformistic"" (or ""antinorm"") behavior, efforts for
promoting social homogenization may trigger violent oscillations.

fluctuations are self-averaging, i.e. that they are statistically similar in
different regions of the given sample volume. By using the scale-length method,
we test whether this assumption is satisfied in several samples of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release Six. We find that the probability density
function (PDF) of conditional fluctuations, filtered on large enough spatial
scales (i.e., r>30 Mpc/h), shows relevant systematic variations in different
sub-volumes of the survey. Instead for scales r<30 Mpc/h the PDF is
statistically stable, and its first moment presents scaling behavior with a
negative exponent around one. Thus while up to 30 Mpc/h galaxy structures have
well-defined power-law correlations, on larger scales it is not possible to
consider whole sample average quantities as meaningful and useful statistical
descriptors. This situation is due to the fact that galaxy structures
correspond to density fluctuations which are too large in amplitude and too
extended in space to be self-averaging on such large scales inside the sample
volumes: galaxy distribution is inhomogeneous up to the largest scales, i.e. r
~ 100 Mpc/h, probed by the SDSS samples. We show that cosmological corrections,
as K-corrections and standard evolutionary corrections, do not qualitatively
change the relevant behaviors. Finally we show that the large amplitude galaxy
fluctuations observed in the SDSS samples are at odds with the predictions of
the standard LCDM model of structure formation.(Abridged version).

commonsense knowledge. Recently, Goyal and Egenhofer proposed a formal model,
known as Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC), for representing direction
relations between connected plane regions. CDC is perhaps the most expressive
qualitative calculus for directional information, and has attracted increasing
interest from areas such as artificial intelligence, geographical information
science, and image retrieval. Given a network of CDC constraints, the
consistency problem is deciding if the network is realizable by connected
regions in the real plane. This paper provides a cubic algorithm for checking
consistency of basic CDC constraint networks, and proves that reasoning with
CDC is in general an NP-Complete problem. For a consistent network of basic CDC
constraints, our algorithm also returns a 'canonical' solution in cubic time.
This cubic algorithm is also adapted to cope with cardinal directions between
possibly disconnected regions, in which case currently the best algorithm is of
time complexity O(n^5).

depends on the magnetic field assumed along the electron beam propagation
direction. For small magnetic fields the electron distribution function becomes
broad in the direction perpendicular to the beam propagation due to the Weibel
instability and the return current is formed by the electrons in a broad and
shifted bulk of the distribution. On the other hand, for stronger magnetic
fields the distribution is more extended in the beam-propagation direction and
the return current is formed by the electrons in the extended distribution
tail. In all cases, the anisotropy of the electron distribution decreases
rapidly due to fast collisionless processes. However, the magnetic field
reduces this anisotropy decrease. The X-ray directivity shows the same trend
and it is always closer to the isotropic case than that in a simple beaming

this note is to give a new, geometric construction of $\cM_{0,2n}^{GIT}$, the
GIT compacification of $\cM_{0,2n}$, in terms of linear systems on $\PP^{2n-2}$
that contract all the rational normal curves passing by the points of a
projective base. These linear systems are a projective analogue of the
forgetful maps between $\bar{\cM}_{0,2n+1}$ and $\bar{\cM}_{0,2n}$. The
construction is performed via a study of the so-called $\textit{contraction}$
maps from the Knudsen-Mumford compactification $\bar{\cM}_{0,2n}$ to
$\cM_{0,2n}^{GIT}$ and of the canonical forgetful maps. As a side result we
also find a linear system on $\bar{\cM}_{0,2n}$ whose associated map is the
contraction map $c_{2n}$.

well (QW) is investigated. The QSD emerge from the ridged geometry of the QW
boundary. Ridges impose additional boundary conditions on the electron wave
function and some quantum states become forbidden. State density reduces in all
energy bands, including conduction band (CB). Hence, electrons, rejected from
the filled bands, must occupy quantum states in the empty bands due to Pauli
Exclusion principle. Both the electron concentration in CB and Fermi energy
increases as in the case of donor doping. Since quantum state density is
reduced, the ridged quantum well (RQW) exhibits quantum properties at widths
approaching 200 nm. Wide RQW can be used to improve photon confinement in
QW-based optoelectronics devices. Reduction in the state density increases the
carrier mobility and makes the ballistic transport regime more pronounced in
the semiconductor QW devices. Furthermore, the QSD doping does not introduce
scattering centers and can be used for power electronics.

beating of modes, effect of noise, unresolved frequencies or rotational

masses of 0.645, 0.650 and 0.680 M_Sun. The 3 `favoured' models have M_H

Low-energy electrons emitting at low frequencies suffer less from energy losses

threefold: Firstly, LOFAR will map the structure of weak magnetic fields in the
outer regions and halos of galaxies and in the Milky Way. Polarized emission is
an excellent tracer of past interactions with other galaxies and with the
interstellar medium. Secondly, high-resolution polarization observations are
needed at high frequencies with the EVLA and SKA to trace the structure of
magnetic fields in the disks and central regions of galaxies in unprecedented
detail. The SKA can also detect polarized emission from distant, unresolved
galaxies. Thirdly, Faraday rotation measures (RM) are signatures of regular
magnetic fields generated by the dynamo mechanism. All-sky surveys of Faraday
rotation measures (RM) towards polarized background sources will be used to
model the structure and strength of the regular magnetic fields in the Milky
Way, the interstellar medium of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. This
will open a new era in the observation of cosmic magnetic fields. ""Key Science""

  Checking","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model checking is a widespread automatic formal analysis that has been
successful in discovering flaws in security protocols. However existing
possibilities for state space explosion still hinder analyses of complex
protocols and protocol configurations. Message Inspection, is a technique that
delimits the branching of the state space due to the intruder model without
excluding possible attacks. In a preliminary simulation, the intruder model
tags the eavesdropped messages with specific metadata that enable validation of
feasibility of possible attack actions. The Message Inspection algorithm then
decides based on these metadata, which attacks will certainly fail according to
known security principles. Thus, it is a priori known that i.e. an encryption
scheme attack cannot succeed if the intruder does not posses the right key in
his knowledge. The simulation terminates with a report of the attack actions
that can be safely removed, resulting in a model with a reduced state space.

phase oscillators on a general network. Here we distinguish the ability of such
a system to self-synchronise from the stability of this behaviour. While
self-synchronisation is a consequence of genuine non-perturbative dynamics, the
stability in dynamical systems is usually accessible by fluctuations about a
fixed point, here taken to be the synchronised solution. We examine this
problem in terms of modes of the graph Laplacian, by which the absolute
Lyapunov stability of the synchronised fixed point is readily demonstrated.
Departures from stability are seen to arise at the next order in fluctuations
where the dynamical equations resemble those for species population models, the
logistic and Lotka-Volterra equations. Methods from these systems are exploited
to analytically derive new critical couplings signalling deviation from
classical stability. We observe in some cases an intermediate regime of
behaviour, between incoherence and synchronisation, where system wide periodic
behaviours are exhibited. We discuss these results in light of simulations.

however, omits the very neutron-rich and heavy nuclei which dominate the
nuclear composition during the last phase of the collapse before neutrino
trapping. Assuming that the composition is given by Nuclear Statistical

derived from individual rates for roughly 2700 individual nuclei. For those
nuclei which dominate in the early stage of the collapse, the individual rates
are derived within the framework of microscopic models, while for the nuclei

They require the bare minimum of data; only one data vector is needed from each
population. Theoretical and numerical aspects of performance are explored,
paying particular attention to the impacts of correlation and heterogeneity
among data components. On the theoretical side, it is shown that our truncated,
thresholded, nearest-neighbor classifier enjoys the same classification
boundary as more conventional, nonrobust approaches, which require finite
moments in order to achieve good performance. In particular, the greater
robustness of our approach does not come at the price of reduced effectiveness.
Moreover, when both training sample sizes equal 1, our new method can have
performance equal to that of optimal classifiers that require independent and
identically distributed data with known marginal distributions; yet, our
classifier does not itself need conditions of this type.

the Sun, the solar outer shape is distorted in latitude. In this paper, we
analyze the consequences of a temporal change in this figure on the luminosity.
To do so, we use the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) as an indicator of
luminosity. Considering that most of the authors have explained the largest
part of the TSI modulation with magnetic network (spots and faculae) but not
the whole, we could set constraints on radius and effective temperature
variations (dR, dT). However computations show that the amplitude of solar
irradiance modulation is very sensitive to photospheric temperature variations.
In order to understand discrepancies between our best fit and recent
observations of Livingston et al. (2005), showing no effective surface
temperature variation during the solar cycle, we investigated small effective
temperature variation in irradiance modeling. We emphasized a phase-shift
(correlated or anticorrelated radius and irradiance variations) in the (dR,
dT)-parameter plane. We further obtained an upper limit on the amplitude of
cyclic solar radius variations, deduced from the gravitational energy
variations. Our estimate is consistent with both observations of the
helioseismic radius through the analysis of f-mode frequencies and observations
of the basal photospheric temperature at Kitt Peak. Finally, we suggest a
mechanism to explain faint changes in the solar shape due to variation of
magnetic pressure which modifies the granules size. This mechanism is supported
by our estimate of the asphericity-luminosity parameter, which implies an
effectiveness of convective heat transfer only in very outer layers of the Sun.

stability of these inequalities with respect to perturbation of the measure is
obtained. The extent of the perturbation is measured using several different
distances between perturbed and original measure, such as a one-sided
$L^\infty$ bound on the ratio between their densities, Wasserstein distances,
and Kullback--Leibler divergence. In particular, an extension of the

and the dependence on the perturbation parameter is improved from linear to
logarithmic. Second, the equivalence of Transport-Entropy inequalities with
different cost-functions is verified, by obtaining a reverse Jensen type
inequality. The main tool used is a previous precise result on the equivalence
between concentration and isoperimetric inequalities in the described setting.

and the quantum gravity problems within a single comprehensive framework. We
show that in quantum theories of gravity in which the zero-point energy density
of the gravitational field is well-defined, the cosmological constant and
zero-point energy problems solve each other by mutual cancellation between the
cosmological constant and the matter and gravitational field zero-point energy
densities. Because of this cancellation, regulation of the matter field
zero-point energy density is not needed, and thus does not cause any trace
anomaly to arise. We exhibit our results in two theories of gravity that are
well-defined quantum-mechanically. Both of these theories are locally conformal
invariant, quantum Einstein gravity in two dimensions and Weyl-tensor-based
quantum conformal gravity in four dimensions (a fourth-order derivative quantum
theory of the type that Bender and Mannheim have recently shown to be
ghost-free and unitary). Central to our approach is the requirement that any
and all departures of the geometry from Minkowski are to be brought about by
quantum mechanics alone. Consequently, there have to be no fundamental
classical fields, and all mass scales have to be generated by dynamical
condensates. In such a situation the trace of the matter field energy-momentum
tensor is zero, a constraint that obliges its cosmological constant and
zero-point contributions to cancel each other identically, no matter how large
they might be. Quantization of the gravitational field is caused by its
coupling to quantized matter fields, with the gravitational field not needing
any independent quantization of its own. With there being no a priori classical
curvature, one does not have to make it compatible with quantization.

  electron-acoustic waves with non-thermal electrons","15 pages include 8 figures",,,,"nlin.PS nlin.SI physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A rigorous theoretical investigation has been made on electron acoustic wave
propagating in unmagnetized collisionless plasma consisting of a cold electron
fluid, non-thermal hot electrons and stationary ions. Based on the
pseudo-potential approach, large amplitude potential structures and the
existence of solitary waves are discussed. The reductive perturbation method
has been employed to derive the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for small but
finite amplitude electrostatic waves. An algebraic method with computerized
symbolic computation, which greatly exceeds the applicability of the existing
tanh, extended tanh methods in obtaining a series of exact solutions of the KdV
equation. Numerical studies have been made using plasma parameters close to
those values corresponding to the dayside auroral zone reveals different
solutions i.e., bell-shaped solitary pulses, rational pulses and solutions with
singularity at a finite points which called blowup solutions in addition to the
propagation of an explosive pulses. The result of the present investigation may
be applicable to some plasma environments, such as terrestrial magnetosphere.
