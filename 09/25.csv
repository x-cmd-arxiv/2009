algorithms is that they are lightweight in the sense that, for an input of size
$n$, they use only ${n}$ bits of disk working space while all previous
approaches use $\Th{n \log n}$ bits of disk working space. Moreover, our
algorithms access disk data only via sequential scans, thus they take full
advantage of modern disk features that make sequential disk accesses much
faster than random accesses.
  We also present a scan-based algorithm for inverting the BWT that uses
$\Th{n}$ bits of working space, and a lightweight {\em internal-memory}
algorithm for computing the BWT which is the fastest in the literature when the
available working space is $\os{n}$ bits.
  Finally, we prove {\em lower} bounds on the complexity of computing and
inverting the BWT via sequential scans in terms of the classic product:
internal-memory space $\times$ number of passes over the disk data.

monotone submodular function subject to 1 matroid and k linear constraints, for
any constant k and epsilon>0. (2) We present a result on minimax packing

T_{q} on q vertices. Maker and Breaker then alternately take turns at claiming

\textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a
class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on
trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial
detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection
probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on
synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and
on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power

a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare
rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance
centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are
equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show
that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources

geometries which may be associated to the gravitational field and thus its

prominent local density peak with an overdensity of greater than 5, which is 8'
(15 comoving Mpc) away from B3 J2330+3927. In this peak, we discovered a
candidate 100 kpc RQLAB. The existence of both types of Lya nebulae in the same
large-scale structure suggests that giant Lya nebulae need special large-scale
environments to form. On smaller scales, however, the location of B3 J2330+3927
is not a significant local density peak in this structure, in contrast to the
RQLAB. There are two possible interpretations of the difference of the local
environments of these two Lya nebulae. Firstly, RQLAB may need a prominent
(delta ~ 5) density peak of galaxies to form through intense star-bursts due to
frequent galaxy interactions/mergers and/or continuous gas accretion in an
overdense environment. On the other hand, Lya halo around HzRG may not always
need a prominent density peak to form if the surrounding Lya halo is mainly
powered by its radio and AGN activities. Alternatively, both RQLAB and Lya halo
around HzRG may need prominent density peaks to form but we could not
completely trace the density of galaxies because we missed evolved and dusty
galaxies in this survey.

compare stars that are born inside the galaxy with those that are born outside
the galaxy and are accreted into the centre of the galaxy. Stars that originate
outside of the bulge are accreted into it early in its formation within 3 Gyrs
so that these stars have high [alpha/Fe] as well as having a high total energy
reflecting their accretion to the centre of the galaxy. Therefore, higher total
energy is a good indicator for finding accreted stars. The bulges of the
simulated galaxies formed through multiple mergers separated by about a Gyr.
Since [alpha/Fe] is sensitive to the first few Gyrs of star formation history,
stars that formed during mergers at different epochs show different [alpha/Fe].
We show that the [Mg/Fe] against star formation time relation can be very
useful to identify a multiple merger bulge formation scenario, provided there
is sufficiently good age information available. Our simulations also show that
stars formed during one of the merger events retain a systematically prograde
rotation at the final time. This demonstrates that the orbit of the ancient
merger that helped to form the bulge could still remain in the kinematics of
bulge stars.

dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to
the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the
system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of
this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic
spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe.
By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of
the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state.
This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak
measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time.
Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can
drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary
unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master
equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the
presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this
formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of
state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak

results here reported have shown that this material is very easily polarisable

polarization of Eu0.6Y0.4MnO3 under an external magnetic field yields a value
with the same order of magnitude of the remanent polarization determined from

the appearance of massless poles which account for it. They are identified by a
spectral analysis of the anomaly graph and are usually interpreted as being of
an infrared origin. Recent investigations show that their presence is not just
confined in the infrared, but that they appear in the effective action under
the most general kinematical conditions, even if they decouple in the infrared.
Further studies reveal that they are responsible for the non-unitary behaviour
of these theories in the ultraviolet (UV) region. We extend this analysis to
the case of the conformal anomaly, showing that the effective action describing
the interaction of gauge fields with gravity is characterized by anomaly poles
that give the entire anomaly and are decoupled in the infrared (IR), in
complete analogy with the chiral case. This complements a related analysis by
Giannotti and Mottola on the trace anomaly in gravity, in which an anomaly pole
has been identified in the corresponding correlator using dispersion theory in
the IR. Our extension is based on an exact computation of the off-shell
correlation function involving an energy-momentum tensor and two vector
currents (the gauge-gauge-graviton vertex) which is responsible for the
appearance of the anomaly.

giant extrasolar planets around the 118 target stars from the VLT NACO H and Ks
band planet search (Masciadri et al. 2005), the VLT and MMT Simultaneous
Differential Imaging (SDI) survey (Biller et al. 2007), and the Gemini Deep

giant extrasolar planets. Our analysis is extended to include the planet
luminosity models of Fortney et al. (2008), as well as the correlation between
stellar mass and frequency of giant planets found by Johnson et al. (2007).
Doubling the sample size of FGKM stars strengthens our conclusions: a model for
extrasolar giant planets with power-laws for mass and semi-major axis as giving
by Cumming et al. (2008) cannot, with 95% confidence, have planets beyond 65
AU, compared to the value of 94 AU reported in Nielsen et al. (2008), using the
models of Baraffe et al. (2003). When the Johnson et al. (2007) correction for
stellar mass (which gives fewer Jupiter-mass companions to M stars with respect
to solar-type stars) is applied, however, this limit moves out to 82 AU. For
the relatively new Fortney et al. (2008) models, which predict fainter planets

type 1 AGN SEDs, in particular the mid-IR spectral index, can be used to
constrain the radial dust cloud distribution power-law index 'a', while other

important additional information for modeling when interpreted simultaneously
with the SED. Although type 2 AGN can, in principle, be used to constrain model
parameters as well, obscuration effects make the analysis more ambiguous. We
propose a simple, interferometry-based method to distinguish between ""compact''

lines in low-resolution spectra taken on the Hale telescope at Palomar, and the
Nordic Optical Telescope and the William Herschel Telescope on La Palma.
  The ultra-compact binary nature of SDSS J090221.35+381941.9 was confirmed
using phase-resolved spectroscopy at the Keck-I telescope. From the
characteristic radial velocity `S-wave' observed in the helium emission lines
we measure an orbital period of 48.31 +/- 0.08 min. The continuum emission can
be described with a blackbody or a helium white dwarf atmosphere of T_eff ~
15,000K, in agreement with theoretical cooling models for relatively massive
accretors and/or donors. The absence in the spectrum of broad helium absorption
lines from the accreting white dwarf suggests that the accreting white dwarf
cannot be much hotter than 15,000K, or that an additional component such as the
accretion disk contributes substantially to the optical flux.
  Two of the candidate systems, SDSS J152509.57+360054.5 and SDSS
J172102.48+273301.2, do show helium absorption in the blue part of their
spectra in addition to the characteristic helium emission lines. This, in
combination with the high effective temperatures of ~18,000K and ~16,000K
suggests both two be at orbital periods below ~40min. The third candidate, SDSS
J164228.06+193410.0, exhibits remarkably strong helium emission on top of a
relatively cool (T_eff~12,000K) continuum, indicating an orbital period above
~50min.

s_{vel} is the one-dimensional velocity dispersion, f is the growth rate, and
b_{pk}(k) and b_{vel}(k) are k-dependent linear spatial and velocity bias
factors. For peaks, the value of s_{vel} depends upon the functional form of
b_{vel}. The peaks model is remarkable because it has unbiased velocities --
peak motions are driven by dark matter flows -- but, in order to achieve this,
b_{vel} is k-dependent. We speculate that this is true in general: k-dependence
of the spatial bias will lead to k-dependence of b_{vel} even if the biased
tracers flow with the dark matter. Because of the k-dependence of the linear
bias parameters, standard manipulations applied to the peak model will lead to
k-dependent estimates of the growth factor that could erroneously be
interpreted as a signature of modified dark energy or gravity. We use the
Fisher formalism to show that the constraint on the growth rate f is degraded
by a factor of two if one allows for a k-dependent velocity bias of the peak
type. We discuss a simple estimate of nonlinear evolution and illustrate the
effect of the peak bias on the redshift space multipoles. For k < 0.1 h/Mpc,
the peak bias is deterministic but k-dependent, so the configuration space bias
is stochastic and scale dependent, both in real and redshift space. We provide
expressions for this stochasticity and its evolution (abridged).

can construct a new theory of the sort envisioned by several of QM's founders:
a Theory of Exclusively Local Beables (TELB). In particular, the usual quantum
mechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)
is not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has
an associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of
additional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,
in ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some
interesting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave
theories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically
viable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration
space) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing
corresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.
That is the theory's \emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue. Its
vices include the fact that it only reproduces the empirical predictions of the
ordinary pilot-wave theory (equivalent, of course, to the predictions of
ordinary quantum theory) for spinless non-relativistic particles, and only then
for wave functions that are everywhere analytic. The goal is thus not to
recommend the TELB proposed here as a replacement for ordinary pilot-wave
theory (or ordinary quantum theory), but is rather to illustrate (with a crude
first stab) that it might be possible to construct a plausible, empirically
viable TELB, and to recommend this as an interesting and perhaps-fruitful
program for future research.

substrate covered with a fluid monolayer of adsorbed chain molecules. Previous
studies of bare surfaces showed that the atomic scale deviations from a sphere
that are present on any tip constructed from discrete atoms lead to significant
deviations from continuum theory and dramatic variability in friction forces.
Introducing an adsorbed monolayer leads to larger deviations from continuum
theory, but decreases the variations between tips with different atomic
structure. Although the film is fluid, it remains in the contact and behaves
qualitatively like a thin elastic coating except for certain tips at high
loads. Measures of the contact area based on the moments or outer limits of the
pressure distribution and on counting contacting atoms are compared. The number
of tip atoms making contact in a time interval grows as a power of the interval
when the film is present and logarithmically with the interval for bare
surfaces. Friction is measured by displacing the tip at a constant velocity or
pulling the tip with a spring. Both static and kinetic friction rise linearly
with load at small loads. Transitions in the state of the film lead to
nonlinear behavior at large loads. The friction is less clearly correlated with
contact area than load.

developed to calculate self-consistent electron density in equilibrium and at
finite bias voltage (as a prerequisite to obtain conductance or current-voltage

electrodes where only a few hundred atoms are typically simulated. Here we
introduce combination of two numerically efficient algorithms which make it

  Monticello, Illinois",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A simple line network model is proposed to study the downlink cellular
network. Without base station cooperation, the system is interference-limited.
The interference limitation is overcome when the base stations are allowed to
jointly encode the user signals, but the capacity-achieving dirty paper coding
scheme can be too complex for practical implementation. A new linear precoding
technique called soft interference nulling (SIN) is proposed, which performs at
least as well as zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming under full network coordination.
Unlike ZF, SIN allows the possibility of but over-penalizes interference. The
SIN precoder is computed by solving a convex optimization problem, and the
formulation is extended to multiple-antenna channels. SIN can be applied when
only a limited number of base stations cooperate; it is shown that SIN under
partial network coordination can outperform full network coordination ZF at
moderate SNRs.

inconspicuous data over a public communication channel in such a way that no
one, aside from the sender and the intended receiver, can even detect the
presence of the secret message. In this paper, we provide a new
provably-secure, private-key steganographic encryption protocol secure in the
framework of Hopper et al. We first present a ""one-time stegosystem"" that
allows two parties to transmit messages of length at most that of the shared
key with information-theoretic security guarantees. The employment of a
pseudorandom generator (PRG) permits secure transmission of longer messages in
the same way that such a generator allows the use of one-time pad encryption
for messages longer than the key in symmetric encryption. The advantage of our
construction, compared to all previous work is randomness efficiency: in the
information theoretic setting our protocol embeds a message of length n bits
using a shared secret key of length (1+o(1))n bits while achieving security
2^{-n/log^{O(1)}n}; simply put this gives a rate of key over message that is 1
as n tends to infinity (the previous best result achieved a constant rate
greater than 1 regardless of the security offered). In this sense, our protocol
is the first truly randomness efficient steganographic system. Furthermore, in
our protocol, we can permit a portion of the shared secret key to be public
while retaining precisely n private key bits. In this setting, by separating
the public and the private randomness of the shared key, we achieve security of
2^{-n}. Our result comes as an effect of the application of randomness
extractors to stegosystem design. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first time extractors have been applied in steganography.

We observed many standard stars around the celestial equator observed by SAAO
astronomers. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, photometric zero points,
and time variation of photometric zero points of each night were determined.
Secondary extinction coefficients and photometric zero points were very stable,
while primary extinction coefficients showed a distinct seasonal variation. We
also determined the transformation coefficients for each filter. For B, V, R,
and I filters, the transformation to the SAAO standard system could be achieved
with a straight line or a combination of two straight lines. However, in the
case of the U filter and Fairchild 486 CCD combination, a significant
non-linear correction term - related to the size of Balmer jump or the strength
of the Balmer lines - of up to 0.08 mags was required. We found that our data
matched well the SAAO photometry in V, B-V, V-I, and R-I. But in U-B, the
difference in zero point was about 3.6 mmag and the scatter was about 0.02 mag.
We attribute the relatively large scatter in U-B to the larger error in U of
the SAAO photometry. We confirm the mostly small differences between the SAAO
standard UBVRI system and the Landolt standard system. We also attempted to
interpret the seasonal variation of the atmospheric extinction coefficients in
the context of scattering sources in the earth's atmosphere.

information in communication networks, it is highly susceptible to errors
caused by various sources. Due to error propagation, errors greatly deteriorate
the throughput of network coding and seriously undermine both reliability and
security of data. Hence error control for network coding is vital. Recently,
constant-dimension codes (CDCs), especially K\""otter-Kschischang (KK) codes,
have been proposed for error control in random linear network coding. KK codes
can also be constructed from Gabidulin codes, an important class of rank metric
codes. Rank metric decoders have been recently proposed for both Gabidulin and
KK codes, but they have high computational complexities. Furthermore, it is not
clear whether such decoders are feasible and suitable for hardware
implementations. In this paper, we reduce the complexities of rank metric
decoders and propose novel decoder architectures for both codes. The synthesis
results of our decoder architectures for Gabidulin and KK codes with limited
error-correcting capabilities over small fields show that our architectures not
only are affordable, but also achieve high throughput.

atmosphere is non-rotating and is modelled as a 1-D open flux tube expanding
super-radially from the stellar photosphere to the planet. An electron beam is
assumed to be generated from the reconnection site of the planet's
magnetosphere. The effects of the electron beam are then implemented in our
simulation as dissipation of the beam momentum and energy at the base of the
corona where the Coulomb collisions become effective. When the sufficient
energy is supplied by the electron beam, a warm region forms in the
chromosphere. This warm region greatly enhances the radiative fluxes
corresponding to the temperature of the chromosphere and transition region. The
warm region can also intermittently contribute to the radiative flux associated
with the coronal temperature due to the thermal instability. However, owing to

noncommutative analogues of the momentum map, Poincar$\acute{e}$-Cartan form

structure on the (skew) tensor product of two symplectic superalgebras (needed
in the description of interaction between systems) is shown to exist if and
only if either both system superalgebras are supercommutative or both
non-supercommutative with a `quantum symplectic structure' characterized by a
\emph{universal} Planck type constant; the presence of such a universal
constant is, therefore, \emph{dictated} by the formalism. This provides proper

of size n can be evaluated with O(sqrt(n)log(n)/log log(n)) many quantum
queries in the bounded-error setting [FGG08, ACRSZ07, RS08b, Rei09]. In
particular, this gives an upper bound on the approximate polynomial degree of

bound on quantum query complexity [BBCMW01].
  These results essentially answer in the affirmative a conjecture of O'Donnell

that agrees in sign with a function on the Boolean cube--of every formula of
size n is O(sqrt(n)).
  In this note, we show that sign degree is super-multiplicative under function
composition. Combining this result with the above mentioned upper bounds on the
quantum query complexity of formulas allows the removal of logarithmic factors
to show that the sign degree of every size n formula is at most sqrt(n).

resistivity switching and its relaxation in a multiferroic insulator La2NiMnO6.
At a fixed base temperature (Tb), the dc resistivity switches abruptly from a
high to a low value, which is manifested as an upward jump in the dc current
density (J) when the electric field (E) exceeds a threshold value Eth. The
fractional change in the resistance is as much as 70 % at room temperature for
Eth = 95 V/cm. The Eth increases with lowering Tb and follows the relation
Eth(Tb) = Eth(0)exp[-Tb/T0], as similar to the behavior found in charge density
wave systems. It is shown that the abrupt jump in J vanishes under pulsed
electric fields if the period between pulses is long enough. Surprisingly, a
step-like increase in J also occurs at a fixed dc electric field (Ec) and T =
Tb, above a threshold waiting time (tth). The tth decreases with increasing Ec
and Tb. Simultaneous measurement of surface temperature during the J-E sweep
and temporal studies suggest that conductive channels are created in an
insulating matrix due to the local self heating, and the coalescence of these
channels above a threshold E- field or time causes the observed anomalies in J.
However, the dissipated Joule power (P = Ith2R) at the transition from high to
low resistive state in the sample decreases with lowering temperature, which
suggests that the Joule heating is the consequence of transition from the high
to low resistance state rather than itself a driving force of the non linear
electrical transport. In addition, non linear J-E characteristics is also found
even with a pulsed voltage sweep, which suggests that intrinsic mechanisms
other than self heating is still active in this material.

energetic arguments. Distinguishing between the low-energy part of the
excitation spectrum, below a microscopic energy-scale, and the high-energy
regime enables one to define a crossover number of particles that is shown to
diverge in the small quench limit. Another crossover number is proposed based
on the fidelity between the initial and final ground-states. Both criteria can
be computed using ground-state techniques that work for larger system sizes
than full spectrum diagonalization. As examples, two models are studied: one
with free bosons in an harmonic trap which frequency is quenched, and the
one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, that is known to be non-integrable and for
which recent studies have uncovered remarkable non-equilibrium behaviors. The
diagonal weights of the time-averaged density-matrix are computed and
observables obtained from this diagonal ensemble are compared with the ones
from statistical ensembles. It is argued that the ""thermalized"" regime of the
Bose-Hubbard model, previously observed in the small quench regime, experiences
strong finite size effects that render difficult a thorough comparison with
statistical ensembles. In addition, we show that the non-thermalized regime,
emerging on finite size systems and for large interaction quenches, is not
related to the existence of an equilibrium quantum critical point but to the
high energy structure of the energy spectrum in the atomic limit. Its features
are reminiscent of the quench from the non-interacting limit to the atomic
limit.

effective positive energy density. This leads in particular to a significant
enhancement of the orbital velocities around galaxies at large distances
compared with the Newtonian case, before dropping to zero as the geometry
merges with a Milne-like cosmology. Besides these ``harmonic'' solutions, there
is another class of solutions which is more similar to Einstein gravity. Thus
the IKKT model provides an accessible candidate for a quantum theory of

monolayer of horizontally vibrated grains at high packing fractions. This
motion exhibits two transitions. The first transition separates a continuous
motion regime at comparatively low packing fractions and large dragging force
from an intermittent motion one at high packing fraction and low dragging
force. Associated to these different motions, we observe a transition from a
linear rheology to a stiffer response. We thereby call ""fluidisation"" this
first transition. A second transition is observed within the intermittent
regime, when the intruder's motion is made of intermittent bursts separated by
long waiting times. We observe a peak in the relative fluctuations of the
intruder's displacements and a critical scaling of the burst amplitudes
distributions. This transition occurs at the jamming point characterized in a
previous study and defined as the point where the static pressure (i.e. the
pressure measured in the absence of vibration) vanishes. Investigating the
motion of the surrounding grains, we show that below the fluidisation
transition, there is a permanent wake of free volume behind the intruder. This
transition is marked by the evolution of the reorganization patterns around the
intruder, which evolve from compact aggregates in the flowing regime to
long-range branched shapes in the intermittent regime, suggesting an increasing
role of the stress fluctuations. Remarkably, the distributions of the kinetic
energy of these reorganization patterns also exhibits a critical scaling at the
jamming transition.

sequentially consistent. However, most modern multiprocessors depend on store
buffering for efficiency, and provide native sequential consistency only at a
substantial performance penalty. To regain sequential consistency, a programmer
has to follow an appropriate programming discipline. However, na\""ive
disciplines, such as protecting all shared accesses with locks, are not
flexible enough for building high-performance multiprocessor software.
  We present a new discipline for concurrent programming under TSO (total store
order, with store buffer forwarding). It does not depend on concurrency
primitives, such as locks. Instead, threads use ghost operations to acquire and
release ownership of memory addresses. A thread can write to an address only if
no other thread owns it, and can read from an address only if it owns it or it
is shared and the thread has flushed its store buffer since it last wrote to an
address it did not own. This discipline covers both coarse-grained concurrency
(where data is protected by locks) as well as fine-grained concurrency (where
atomic operations race to memory).
  We formalize this discipline in Isabelle/HOL, and prove that if every
execution of a program in a system without store buffers follows the
discipline, then every execution of the program with store buffers is
sequentially consistent. Thus, we can show sequential consistency under TSO by
ordinary assertional reasoning about the program, without having to consider
store buffers at all.

partons inside unpolarized hadrons that can arise in the presence of nonzero

polarized gluons produce specific azimuthal dependences of the two jets that in

at the angular deviation from the back-to-back situation, rather they enter jet

u,v,b,y images of the Galactic globular cluster Omega Cen. Optical data were
supplemented with new multiband near-infrared (NIR) photometry (350 J,H,K_s
images). The final optical-NIR catalog covers a region of more than 20*20
arcmin squared across the cluster center. We use different optical-NIR
color-color planes together with proper motion data available in the literature
to identify candidate cluster red giant (RG) stars. By adopting different
Stroemgren metallicity indices we estimate the photometric metallicity for
~4,000 RGs, the largest sample ever collected. The metallicity distributions
show multiple peaks
([Fe/H]_phot=-1.73+/-0.08,-1.29+/-0.03,-1.05+/-0.02,-0.80+/-0.04,-0.42+/-0.12
and -0.07+/-0.08 dex) and a sharp cut-off in the metal-poor tail
([Fe/H]_phot<=-2 dex) that agree quite well with spectroscopic measurements. We
identify four distinct sub-populations,namely metal-poor (MP,[Fe/H]<=-1.49),
metal-intermediate (MI,-1.49<[Fe/H]<=-0.93), metal-rich
(MR,-0.95<[Fe/H]<=-0.15) and solar metallicity (SM,[Fe/H]~0). The last group
includes only a small fraction of stars (~8+/-5%) and should be confirmed
spectroscopically. Moreover, using the difference in metallicity based on
different photometric indices, we find that the 19+/-1% of RGs are candidate
CN-strong stars. This fraction agrees quite well with recent spectroscopic
estimates and could imply a large fraction of binary stars. The Stroemgren
metallicity indices display a robust correlation with alpha-elements
([Ca+Si/H]) when moving from the metal-intermediate to the metal-rich regime
([Fe/H]>-1.7 dex).

previous results which have pointed out, for some specific problems, a depth
separation between the one-way model and the quantum circuit model. Since
one-way model has the same computational power as unbounded quantum fan-out
circuits, the quantum Fourier transform can be approximated in constant depth
in the one-way model, and thus the factorisation can be done by a polytime
probabilistic classical algorithm which has access to a constant-depth one-way

that this extra power is reduced to the capability to perform unbounded

in the zCOSMOS 10k sample, for which both accurate galaxy classifications and a
detailed description of the local density field are available.
  The global LF exhibits a brightening of ~0.7 mag in M* from z~0.2 to z~0.9.
At low z, late types dominate at faint magnitudes, while the bright end is
populated mainly by early types. At higher z, late-type galaxies evolve
significantly and, at z~1, the contribution from the various types to the
bright end of the LF is comparable. The evolution for early types is in both
luminosity and normalization. A similar behaviour is exhibited by late types,
but with an opposite trend for the normalization. Studying the role of the
environment, we find that the global LF of galaxies in overdense regions has
always a brighter M* and a flatter slope. In low density environments, the main
contribution to the LF is from blue galaxies, while for high density
environments there is an important contribution from red galaxies to the bright
end. The differences between the global LF in the two environments are not due
to only a difference in the relative numbers of red and blue galaxies, but also
to their relative luminosity distributions: the value of M* for both types in
underdense regions is always fainter than in overdense environments.
  The ""specular"" evolution of late- and early-type galaxies is consistent with
a scenario where a part of blue galaxies is transformed in red galaxies with
increasing cosmic time, without significant changes in the fraction of
intermediate-type galaxies. The bulk of this tranformation in overdense regions
probably happened before z~1, while it is still ongoing at lower z in
underdense environments.

sites and are distributed mainly in the Galactic plane. We intend to
investigate the possible contribution of the forthcoming ESA Planck mission to
the science of UCHII regions by evaluating the possibility of detecting UCHIIs
that are bright in the radio regime. We performed new 7 mm observations of a
sample of UCHII regions. For each source in our sample, the free-free radio
spectrum has been modeled. Along with far-IR measurements, our spectra allow us
to estimate the flux densities of the sources in the millimeter and
sub-millimeter bands. The possibility of Planck detecting the selected sources
can be assessed by comparing the estimated flux densities to the expected
sensitivity in each Planck channel. We conclude that, in the case of the
present sample, located close to the Galactic center, Planck will have a very
low detection rate. In contrast, assuming that our sample is representative of
the whole UCHII-region population, we derive a very high probability of
detecting this kind of source with Planck if located instead close to the
anticenter.

radiative transfer modeling using CMFGEN and the 2-D Busche & Hillier codes.

blueshift, and extension, definitively showing that the IRC+10420 outflow is

pole to equator (8-16), where the redshifted light is substantially diminished.

and a host graph G on n vertices, does G contain a subgraph that is isomorphic
to H? Eppstein [SODA 95, J'GAA 99] gives the first linear time algorithm for
subgraph isomorphism for a fixed-size pattern, say of order k, and arbitrary
planar host graph, improving upon the O(n^\sqrt{k})-time algorithm when using
the ``Color-coding'' technique of Alon et al [J'ACM 95]. Eppstein's algorithm
runs in time k^O(k) n, that is, the dependency on k is superexponential. We
solve an open problem posed in Eppstein's paper and improve the running time to
2^O(k) n, that is, single exponential in k while keeping the term in n linear.
Next to deciding subgraph isomorphism, we can construct a solution and
enumerate all solutions in the same asymptotic running time. We may list w
subgraphs with an additive term O(w k) in the running time of our algorithm. We
introduce the technique of ""embedded dynamic programming"" on a suitably
structured graph decomposition, which exploits the topology of the underlying
embeddings of the subgraph pattern (rather than of the host graph). To achieve
our results, we give an upper bound on the number of partial solutions in each
dynamic programming step as a function of pattern size--as it turns out, for
the planar subgraph isomorphism problem, that function is single exponential in
the number of vertices in the pattern.

Kobayashi Maskawa mixing are analyzed in a class of intersecting D-brane
configurations with Standard Model gauge symmetry. The relevant mass matrices
are constructed taking into account the constraints imposed by extra abelian
symmetries and anomaly cancelation conditions. Possible mass generating
mechanisms including perturbative as well as non-perturbative effects are
discussed and specific patterns of mass textures are found characterized by the
hierarchies of the scales where the various sources contribute. It is argued
that the Cholesky decomposition of the mass matrices is the most appropriate
way to determine the properties of these fermion mass patterns, while the
associated triangular mass matrix form provides a unified description of all
phenomenologically equivalent symmetric and non-symmetric mass matrices. An
elegant analytic formula is derived for the Cholesky triangular form of the
mass matrices where the entries are given as simple functions of the mass
eigenstates and the diagonalizing transformation entries. Finally, motivated by
the possibility of vanishing zero Yukawa mass entries in several D-brane and
F-theory constructions due to the geometry of the internal space, we analyse in
detail all possible texture-zeroes mass matrices within the proposed new
context. These new texture-zeroes are compared to those existing in the
literature while D-brane inspired cases are worked out in detail.

empirical principle that structured natural proteins possess a unique three
dimensional structure. In particular, the human chemokine lymphotactin protein
(Ltn) exists in two distinct conformations (one monomeric and one dimeric)
under physiological conditions. In this work we use a Ca Go-model to show how
this very peculiar behavior can be reproduced. From the study of the
thermodynamics and of the kinetics we characterize the interconversion
mechanism. In particular, this takes place through the docking of the two
chains living in a third monomeric, partially unfolded, state which shows a
residual structure involving a set of local contacts common to the two native
conformations. The main feature of two-fold proteins appears to be the sharing
of a common set of local contacts between the two distinct folds as confirmed
by the study of two designed two-fold proteins. Metamorphic proteins may be
more common than expected.

time series of receptor occupancy. The increased accuracy stems from solely
considering the unoccupied time intervals - disregarding the occupied time
intervals as these do not contain any information about the external particle

perturbations of the density field may contain a degree of non-Gaussianity
which would influence the subsequent evolution of cosmic structures at large
scales. In order to study their impact, we use a set of three cosmological
DM-only simulations starting from initial conditions with different levels of
non-Gaussianity: f_NL=0,+/-100. More specifically, we focus on the distribution
of galaxy clusters at different redshifts and, using suitable scaling
relations, we determine their X-ray and SZ signals. Our analysis allows us to
estimate the differences in the logN-logS and logN-logY due to the different
initial conditions and to predict the cluster counts at different redshifts
expected for future surveys (eROSITA and SPT). We also use a second set of
simulations assuming a different cosmological scenario to estimate how the
dependence on f_NL is degenerate with respect to other parameters. Our results
indicate that the effects introduced by a realistic amount of primordial
non-Gaussianity are small when compared to the ones connected with current
uncertainties in cosmological parameters, particularly with sigma_8. However,
if future surveys will be associated with optical follow-up campaigns to
determine the cluster redshift, an analysis of the samples at z>1 can provide
significant constraints on f_NL. In particular we predict that the SPT cluster
survey will be able to detect ~1000 clusters at z>1 for the Gaussian case, with
a difference of 15-20 per cent associated to f_NL=+/-100.

explanation for the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion that does not
require dark energy. In the simplest class of inhomogeneous models, we live
within a large, spherically symmetric void. Several studies have shown that
such a model can be made consistent with many observations, in particular the
redshift--luminosity distance relation for type Ia supernovae, provided that
the void is of Gpc size and that we live close to the center. Such a scenario
challenges the Copernican principle that we do not occupy a special place in
the universe. We use the first-year Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II supernova
search data set as well as the Constitution supernova data set to put
constraints on the observer position in void models, using the fact that
off-center observers will observe an anisotropic universe. We first show that a
spherically symmetric void can give good fits to the supernova data for an
on-center observer, but that the two data sets prefer very different voids. We
then continue to show that the observer can be displaced at least fifteen
percent of the void scale radius from the center and still give an acceptable
fit to the supernova data. When combined with the observed dipole anisotropy of
the cosmic microwave background however, we find that the data compells the

on these results, we conclude that considerable fine-tuning of our position
within the void is needed to fit the supernova data, strongly disfavouring the
model from a Copernican principle point of view.

ramifications in applications ranging from predicting disease spread to
optimizing resource allocation. Because of its relevance and availability,
written correspondence provides a powerful proxy for studying human activity.
One school of thought is that human correspondence is driven by responses to
received correspondence, a view that requires distinct response mechanism to
explain e-mail and letter correspondence observations. Here, we demonstrate
that, like e-mail correspondence, the letter correspondence patterns of 16
writers, performers, politicians, and scientists are well-described by the
circadian cycle, task repetition and changing communication needs. We confirm
the universality of these mechanisms by properly rescaling letter and e-mail
correspondence statistics to reveal their underlying similarity.

multiplicative group of $D$. In this paper we study locally nilpotent maximal
subgroups of $D^*$. We give some conditions that influence the existence of
locally nilpotent maximal subgroups in division ring with infinite center.
Also, it is shown that if $M$ is a locally nilpotent maximal subgroup that is
algebraic over $F$, then either it is the multiplicative group of some maximal
subfield of $D$ or it is center by locally finite. If, in addition we assume
that $F$ is finite and $M$ is nilpotent, then the second case cannot occur,
i.e. $M$ is the multiplicative group of some maximal subfield of $D$.

groups to giant isolated ellipticals (or fossil groups). To test this
evolutionary scenario, we investigated the environment of 4 galaxy pairs
composed of a giant elliptical galaxy and its spiral companion. The pairs are
very similar from the optical and dynamical point of view, but have very
different X-ray properties. The faint galaxy population around the pairs was
observed with VIMOS on the VLT. These observations show that the presence of
extended diffuse X-ray emission from an IGM is not necessarily connected to the
presence of a numerous faint galaxy population. The study of luminosity
functions (LFs) indicate that our X-ray luminous pairs are more dynamically
evolved than a sample of poor groups with comparable X-ray luminosities from
the literature. However, our X-ray faint pairs resemble the LF of those X-ray
bright groups and may represent a phase in the dynamical evolution of these
groups, where the recent or ongoing interaction, in which the pair E is
involved, has destroyed or at least decreased the luminosity of the IGM. The
X-ray faint groups' LF is also consitent with their evolution into a fossil
group.
