symmetries is often one of the few pieces of information we have at our
disposal. Gauging (part of) such global symmetries can then lead to interesting
new theories, which are usually still quite mysterious. In this work, we
describe a set of tools that can be used to explore the superconformal phases
of these theories. In particular, we describe the contribution of such
non-Lagrangian sectors to the NSVZ beta-function, and elucidate the counting of
marginal deformations. We apply our techniques to N=1 theories obtained by mass
deformations of the N=2 conformal theories recently found by Gaiotto. Because
the basic building block of these theories is a triskelion, or trivalent
vertex, we dub them ""Sicilian gauge theories."" We identify these N=1 theories
as compactifications of the six-dimensional A_N (2,0) theory on Riemann
surfaces with punctures and SU(2) Wilson lines. These theories include the
holographic duals of the N=1 supergravity solutions found by Maldacena and
Nunez.

consequence of such a duality is that particles described by QED carry magnetic
as well as electric charges. The proposal requires a vanishing zero bare
fermion mass in both theories; Dirac mass terms are incompatible with the
conservation of magnetic charge much as Majorana masses spoil the conservation
of electric charge. The physical spectrum comprises photons and massless
spin-1/2 particles carrying equal or opposite electric and magnetic charges.
The four particle states described by the Dirac fermion correspond to the four
possible charge assignments of elementary dyons. This scale invariant spectrum

favorable locations for impurities, leading to a degree of spatial segregation

(DMAs) using a well-tested computer code. This grid of models covers most of
the expected combinations of stellar parameters, which are made up of the
stellar temperature, the stellar luminosity, the stellar mass, the abundance of
condensible carbon, and the velocity amplitude of the pulsation. The resultant
mass-loss rates and wind speeds are clearly affected by the choice of stellar
temperature, mass, luminosity and the abundance of available carbon. In certain
parts of the parameter space there is also an inevitable mass-loss threshold,
below which a dust-driven wind is not possible. Contrary to some previous
studies, we find a strong dependence on the abundance of free carbon, which
turns out to be a critical parameter. Furthermore, we have found that the dust
grains that form in the atmosphere may grow too large for the commonly used
small particle approximation of the dust opacity to be strictly valid. This may
have some bearing on the wind properties, although further study of this
problem is needed before quantitative conclusions can be drawn. The wind
properties show relatively simple dependences on stellar parameters above the
mass-loss threshold, while the threshold itself is of a more complicated
nature. Hence, we chose not to derive any simplistic mass-loss formula, but
rather provide a mass-loss prescription in the form of an easy-to-use FORTRAN
routine. Since this mass-loss routine is based on data coming from an
essentially self-consistent model of mass loss, it may therefore serve as a
better mass-loss prescription for stellar evolution calculations than empirical
formulae. Furthermore, we conclude that there are still some issues that need
to be investigated, such as the role of grain-sizes.

sources of plasma from moons such as Enceladus (Saturn) and Io (Jupiter). We
use a scaled form of Euler potentials for the Jovian magnetodisc field (Caudal,
1986). In this formalism, the magnetic field is assumed to be azimuthally
symmetric about the planet's axis of rotation, and plasma temperature is
constant along a field line. We perturb the dipole potential by using
simplified distributions of plasma pressure and angular velocity for both
planets, based on observations by Cassini (Saturn) and Voyager (Jupiter). Our
results quantify the degree of radial `stretching' exerted on the dipolar field
lines through the plasma's rotational motion and pressure. A simplified version
of the field model, the `homogeneous disc', can be used to easily estimate the
distance of transition in the outer magnetosphere between pressure-dominated
and centrifugally-dominated disc structure. We comment on the degree of
equatorial confinement as represented by the scale height associated with disc
ions of varying mass and temperature. For Saturn, we identify the principal
forces which contribute to the magnetodisc current and make comparisons between
the field structure predicted by the model and magnetic field measurements from
Cassini. For Jupiter, we reproduce Caudal's original calculation in order to
validate our model implementation. We also show that compared to Saturn, where
plasma pressure gradient is, on average, weaker than centrifugal force, the
outer plasmadisc of Jupiter is clearly a pressure-dominated structure.

in limited regions of parameter space. Even in the first year of LHC running,
observable signals in multi-muon plus jets channel (without cutting on missing
E_T) can occur for interesting ranges of parameters. The highly motivated
Yukawa unified SUSY models-- where the dark matter is expected to be of mixed

(Loxodonta africana). In order to investigate allometric patterns in
proboscideans and terrestrial mammals with parasagittal limb kinematics, the
computed slopes (slenderness exponents) are compared with published values for
mammals and studied within a framework of theoretical models of long bone
scaling under gravity and muscle forces. Limb bone allometry in E. maximus and
the Elephantidae are congruent with adaptation to bending and/or torsion
induced by muscular forces during fast locomotion, as in other mammals, whereas
limb bones in L. africana appear adapted for coping with the compressive forces
of gravity. Consequently, hindlimb bones are expected to be more compliant than
forelimb bones in accordance with in vivo studies on elephant locomotory
kinetics and kinematics, and the resultant negative limb compliance gradient in
extinct and extant elephants, which contrasts to other mammals, suggests an
important locomotory constraint preventing achievement of a full-body aerial
phase during locomotion. Differences in ecology may be responsible for the
subtle differences observed between African and Asian elephant locomotion, and
the more pronounced differences in allometric and mechanical patterns
established in this study.

resolution that makes it possible to trace the dynamics of the flow to a
projected distance of only 10 AU from the source. As noted by previous studies,
the redshifted flow is much slower than its fainter blueshifted counterpart.
Our observations clearly show that both the radial velocities and the emission
line widths are larger closer to the source on both sides of the jet. The line
widths are 20% - 30% of the jet velocity on both sides of the flow,
significantly larger than would be produced by a divergent constant velocity
flow. The observed line widths could arise from a layered velocity structure in
the jet or from magnetic waves. A bright knot in the redshifted jet has no
concomitant increase in line width, implying that it is not heated by a bow
shock. Alternate heating mechanisms include planar shocks, ambipolar diffusion
and magnetic reconnection.

that even after collapse of the wave function, the information previously

unusual 2-stage nature, consisting of a microscopic entity or rhodopsin
molecule which is not affected by the environment, contained within a

deflected by not only intergalactic magnetic field but also Galactic magnetic
field (GMF). These magnetic fields can weaken the positive correlation between
the arrival directions of HECRs and the positions of their sources. In order to
explore the effect of GMF on the expected correlation, we simulate the arrival
distribution of protons with the energy above $6 \times 10^{19}$ eV taking
several GMF models into account, and then test the correlation between the
protons and their sources assumed in the simulation. The dependence of the
correlation signals on GMF models are also investigated. The correlation can be
observed by accumulating $\sim 200$ protons in a half hemisphere. Typical
angular scale at which the positive signal of the correlation is maximized
depends on the spiral component of GMF models. That angular scale is $\sim 5^o$
for bisymmetric spiral (BS) GMF models and $\sim 7^o$ for axisymmetric spiral
(AS) GMF models if the number density of HECR sources, $n_s$, is $\sim 10^{-4}$
Mpc$^{-3}$. An additional vertical (dipole) component of GMF affects these
angular scale by $0.5^o$ - $1^o$. The difference between the correlation signal
for the BS models and that for the AS models is prominent in the northern sky.
Significance of the positive correlation depends on source distribution. The
probability that the number of simulated HECR events correlating with sources
is smaller than the number of random events correlating with the same sources
by chance is much less than $10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\sigma$) in almost all the source
distributions with $n_s = 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ under 200 protons detection, but
$\sim 10\%$ of source distributions predicts the chance probability more than
$10^{-3}$ in the AS GMF model. In addition, we also briefly discuss the effect
of GMF for heavy-nuclei dominated composition.

the U.S. will soon seriously lag that on the ESO VLT as measured by funds
available. It called for a significant infusion of public funds for AO
development and implementation so that when combined with private funds, the
U.S. astronomical community as a whole would be able to take full advantage of
AO systems on both public and private telescopes. In 2006 I estimated that the
total amount of public (NSF) funds that would be available in 2009 for AO
related non-science activities would be about $6M.
  This article updates the analysis done in my previous article. I show that
for 2009 the funds for AO related non-science activities are about $7M in spite
of the termination of the AODP program. Federal stimulus funds (ARRA) to the
NSF and its grant programs account for a not insignificant part of this $7M. I
make the probably optimistic prediction that in 2010 there will be just over
$6M in NSF funds available for AO related non-science work.

development and implementation since the predictions made in 2006. If private

preselection protocol which produces genuine macroscopic superpositions and
entanglement, thus eliminating postselection and dark counts. Such
superpositions are usually difficult to generate. Their study paves the way for
testing the quantum nature of biological organisms such as plants, viruses and
human brain. Our results find application in creating quantum superpositions of
living organisms and their manipulation.

motion (with a period of 11.113d) and the long-term, overall brightness
variation (with a period of 416.9d) of this strongly interacting Be + G
semi-detached binary. It is shown that this long-term variation must be due to
attenuation of the total light by some variable circumbinary material. We
derived the binary mass ratio $M_{\rm G}/M_{\rm B}$ = 0.17\p0.03 based on the
assumption that the G-type secondary fills its Roche lobe and rotates
synchronously. Using this value of the mass ratio as well as the radial
velocities of the G-star, we obtained a consistent light curve model and
improved estimates of the stellar masses, radii, luminosities and effective
temperatures. We demonstrate that the observed lines of the B-type primary may
not be of photospheric origin. We also discover rapid and periodic light
changes visible in the high-quality residual CoRoT light curves. AU Mon is put
into perspective by a comparison with known binaries exhibiting long-term

of a star cluster on its mass may be the interplay between stellar feedback and
the binding energy of the cluster-forming molecular cloud core. Given these
results, it would follow that an integrated galactic initial mass function

Photometric errors and completeness are estimated by means of artificial source
Monte Carlo simulations. Dust extinction is estimated by considering F160W
NICMOS observations of the central regions of the galaxies, augmenting our
wavelength coverage. In all galaxies we identify star clusters with a wide
range of ages, from young (age < 8 Myr) blue clusters, with typical mass of
10^3 Msun to older (age > 100-250 Myr), more massive, red clusters. Some of the
latter might likely evolve into objects similar to the Milky Way's globular
clusters. We compute the specific frequencies for the older clusters with
respect to the galaxy and bulge luminosities. Specific frequencies relative to
the galaxy light appear consistent with the globular cluster specific
frequencies of early-type spirals. We compare the specific frequencies relative
to the bulge light with the globular cluster specific frequencies of dwarf
galaxies, which have a surface-brightness profile that is similar to that of
the pseudo-bulges in our sample. The specific frequencies we derive for our
sample galaxies are higher than those of the dwarf galaxies, supporting an
evolutionary scenario in which some of the dwarf galaxies might be the remnants
of harassed late-type spiral galaxies which hosted a pseudo-bulge.

are detected from the majority of stars and about 40 percent of the outflows

a globular cluster. Outflow speeds and line strengths do not depend on

rotating RHB stars in the field. About 0.1-0.2 M_sun will be lost on the RHB

means of classical kinetic equations whose applicability to processes in the

vertex contribution to the CP-violating parameter. At high temperatures it is a
few times larger than in vacuum and asymptotically reaches the vacuum value as
the temperature decreases. Contrary to the results obtained earlier in the
framework of thermal field theory, the corrections are only linear in the
particle number densities. An important feature of the Kadanoff-Baym formalism
is that it is free of the double-counting problem, i.e. no need for real
intermediate state subtraction arises. In particular, this means that the
structure of the equations automatically ensures that the asymmetry vanishes in
equilibrium. These results give a first glimpse into a number of new and

the standard method for estimating pulsar ages is to infer an age from the rate
of spin-down. While the generic spin-down age may give realistic estimates for
normal pulsars, it can fail for pulsars with very short periods. Details of the
spin-up process during the low mass X-ray binary phase pose additional
constraints on the period (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that may consequently
affect the age estimate. Here, we propose a new recipe to estimate millisecond
pulsar (MSP) ages that parametrically incorporates constraints arising from
binary evolution and limiting physics. We show that the standard method can be
improved by this approach to achieve age estimates closer to the true age
whilst the standard spin-down age may over- or under-estimate the age of the
pulsar by more than a factor of ~10 in the millisecond regime. We use this
approach to analyze the population on a broader scale. For instance, in order
to understand the dominant energy loss mechanism after the onset of radio
emission, we test for a range of plausible braking indices. We find that a
braking index of n=3 is consistent with the observed MSP population. We
demonstrate the existence and quantify the potential contributions of two main
sources of age corruption: the previously known ""age bias"" due to secular
acceleration and ""age contamination"" driven by sub-Eddington progenitor
accretion rates. We explicitly show that descendants of LMXBs that have
accreted at very low rates will exhibit ages that appear older than the age of
the Galaxy. We further elaborate on this technique, the implications and
potential solutions it offers regarding MSP evolution, the underlying age

TrES-1 and TrES-2, obtained over a period of three to four years, in order to
search for variabilities in observed mid-transit times and to set limits for

observed transits of TrES-1 and TrES-2 over several years. Based on these new
data and previously published work, we studied the observed light curves and
searched for variations in the difference between observed and calculated
(based on a fixed ephemeris) transit times. To model possible transit timing
variations, we used polynomials of different orders, simulated O-C diagrams
corresponding to a perturbing third mass and sinusoidal fits. For each model we
calculated the chi-squared residuals and the False Alarm Probability (FAP). For
TrES-1 we can exclude planetary companions (>1 M_earth) in the 3:2 and 2:1 MMRs
having high FAPs based on our transit observations from ground. Additionally,
the presence of a light time effect caused by e. g. a 0.09 M_sun mass star at a
distance of 7.8 AU is possible. As for TrES-2, we found a better ephemeris of
Tc = 2,453,957.63512(28) + 2.4706101(18) x Epoch and a good fit for a sine
function with a period of 0.2 days, compatible with a moon around TrES-2 and an
amplitude of 57 s, but it was not a uniquely low chi-squared value that would
indicate a clear signal. In both cases, TrES-1 and TrES-2, we were able to put
upper limits on the presence of additional perturbers masses. We also conclude
that any sinusoidal variations that might be indicative of exomoons need to be
confirmed with higher statistical significance by further observations, noting
that TrES-2 is in the field-of-view of the Kepler Space Telescope.

for physical properties such as star formation rates and stellar, gas and halo

convergence in the turbulent energy densities and stresses as the resolution
increases, contrary to results for zero net flux, unstratified boxes. The ratio
of total stress to midplane pressure has a mean of ~0.01, although there can be
significant fluctuations on long (>~50 orbit) timescales. We find that the time
averaged stresses are largely insensitive to both the radial or vertical aspect
ratio of our simulation domain. For simulations with explicit dissipation, we
find that stratification extends the range of Reynolds and magnetic Prandtl

of the blazar GLF that predict higher relative contributions of high-redshift

and in frequency coverage. The primary elements of the Expanded Very Large

coverage from 1 to 50 GHz, new local oscillator, intermediate frequency, and
wide bandwidth data transmission systems to carry signals with 16 GHz total
bandwidth from each antenna, and a new digital correlator with the capability
to process this bandwidth with an unprecedented number of frequency channels
for an imaging array. Also included are a new monitor and control system and

This requires an estimate of their impact on all measurement foreseen at the
LHC. Conversely it provides new means of studying MPI at the LHC. In this paper
we examine the role of MPI at the LHC, with the design energy of 14 TeV, in - Z
production in association with four jets, - W\pm W\pm in association with zero
or two jets. -W+ W- in association with two jets. In all cases the vector
bosons are assumed to decay leptonically.
  The MPI contribution to Z+4j is dominated by events with two jets with
balancing transverse momentum. It is possible to achieve a good signal to
background ratio, close to 20%, for MPI compared to Single Interaction
processes by selecting events with two jets with large separation in the
transverse plane. The corresponding statistical significance for a luminosity
of 1 inverse fb is about 6.9 for the mu+mu- channel alone.
  The final state channel in which only two same-sign high transverse momentum
charged leptons are required and additional hard jets are vetoed is dominated
by MPI, with an expected yield of 2500 events with the full LHC luminosity.

shapes that emerge from nanometric to macroscopic scales. Natural or
manufactured materials (sandstones, sedimentary rocks and cement), colloidal
solutions (proteins and DNA), biological cells, tissues and organs (lungs,
kidneys and placenta), they all present irregularly shaped ""scenes"" for a
fundamental transport ""performance"", that is, diffusion. Here, the geometrical
complexity, entangled with the stochastic character of diffusive motion,
results in numerous fascinating and sometimes unexpected effects like diffusion
screening or localization. These effects control many diffusion-mediated
processes that play an important role in heterogeneous catalysis, biochemical
mechanisms, electrochemistry, growth phenomena, oil recovery, or building
industry. In spite of a long and rich history of academic and industrial
research in this field, it is striking to see how little we know about
diffusion in complex geometries, especially the one which occurs in three
dimensions.
  We present our recent results on restricted diffusion. We look into the role
of geometrical complexity at different levels, from boundary microroughness to
hierarchical structure and connectivity of the whole diffusion-confining
domain. We develop a new approach which consists in combining fast random walk
algorithms with spectral tools. The main focus is on studying diffusion in
model complex geometries (von Koch boundaries, Kitaoka acinus, etc.), as well
as on developing and testing spectral methods. We aim at extending this
knowledge and at applying the accomplished arsenal of theoretical and numerical
tools to structures found in nature and industry.

contained up to 30000 dark matter haloes capable of forming stars by molecular
hydrogen cooling. These minihaloes were strongly clustered and feedback may
have severely limited the actual number of Population III stars that formed. By
the present day, the remnants of the first stars would be strongly concentrated
to the centre of the main halo. If a second generation of long-lived stars
formed near the first (the first star relics), we would expect to find half of
them within 30kpc/h of the galactic centre and a significant fraction in
satellites where they may be singled out by their anomalous metallicity
patterns. The first halo in which gas could cool by atomic hydrogen line
radiation formed at z=25; by z=10, the number of such first galaxies had
increased to ~300. Feedback might have decreased the number of first galaxies
at the time they undergo significant star formation, but not the number that
survive to the present because near neighbours merge. Half of all the ""first
galaxies"" that form before z=10 merge with the main halo before z~3 and most
lose a significant fraction of their mass. However, today there should still be
more than 20 remnants orbiting within the central ~30kpc/h of the Milky Way.
These satellites have circular velocities of a few kilometers per second or
more, comparable to those of known Milky Way dwarfs. They are a promising
hunting ground for the remnants of the earliest epoch of star formation.

source coding, FPQ produces a greater number of possible quantization rates and

planets, we have constructed a coupled period-mass function through the
non-parametric approach. This analytic expression of the coupled period-mass
function has been obtained for the first time in this field. Moreover, due to a
moderate period-mass correlation, the shapes of mass/period functions vary as a
function of period/mass. These results of mass and period functions give way to
two important implications: (1) the deficit of massive close-in planets is
confirmed, and (2) the more massive planets have larger ranges of possible
semi-major axes. These interesting statistical results will provide important
clues into the theories of planetary formation.

often referred to as hybrid linear modeling). We translate some important
instances of multi-manifold modeling to hybrid linear modeling in embedded
spaces, without explicitly performing the embedding but applying the kernel
trick. The resulting algorithm, Kernel Spectral Curvature Clustering, uses
kernels at two levels - both as an implicit embedding method to linearize
nonflat manifolds and as a principled method to convert a multiway affinity

the distribution of $\delta_v(t)$ exhibits an exponential tail. The variation
of $\delta_v(t)$ with time is found to be driven by the fluctuations of the
large-scale mean flow velocity and the local horizontal velocities close to the
plate can be used as an instant measure of this variation. It is further found
that in the present parameter range of the experiment the mean velocity profile
measured in the laboratory frame can be brought into coincidence with the
theoretical Prandtl-Blasius laminar BL profile, if it is resampled relative to
the time-dependent frame of $\delta_v(t)$.

portion of the Sgr tidal debris stream. The distribution of velocities in the
Galactic standard of rest frame (V_GSR) of the 26 RRLs in the region is not
consistent with a smooth halo population. Upon comparison with the Sgr
disruption models of Law et al (2005), a prominent group of five stars having
highly negative radial velocities (V_GSR ~ -175 kms-1) is consistent with
predictions for old trailing debris when the Galactic halo is modeled as
oblate. The observations also require that the recent trailing debris stream
has a broader spread perpendicular to the Sgr plane than predicted by the
models. We have also investigated the possible association of the Virgo Stellar
Stream (VSS) with Sgr debris by comparing radial velocities for RRLs in the
region with the same models, finding similarities in the velocity-position
trends. As suggested by our earlier work, the stars in the VSS region with
large negative V_GSR values are likely to be old leading Sgr debris, but we
find that while old trailing Sgr debris may well make a contribution at
positive V_GSR values, it is unlikely to fully account for the VSS feature.
Overall we find that further modeling is needed, as trailing arm data generally
favors oblate models while leading arm data favors prolate models, with no
single potential fitting all the observed data.

stable and decay with time. For modes of sufficiently large spherical harmonic
degree $l$ the dimensionless growth rate scales as $\sqrt{l/\Gamma}$, where
$\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the shell. The instability commences at the
contact interface separating the shocked eject a and shocked ambient gas and
propagates to the shocks. The reverse shock front responds promptly to the in
stability and exhibits rapidly growing distortions at early times. Propagation
to the forward shock is slower, and it is anticipated that the region near the
contact will become fully turbulent before the instability is communicated to
the forward shock. The non-universality of the Blandford-McKee blast wave
solution suggests that turbulence generated by the instability in the shocked

that the instability may affect the emission from the shocked ejecta in the

on transitions. They define quantitative languages L that assign to each word w
a real number L(w). The value of an infinite word w is computed as the maximal
value of all runs over w, and the value of a run as the maximum, limsup,
liminf, limit average, or discounted sum of the transition weights. We
introduce probabilistic weighted automata, in which the transitions are chosen
in a randomized (rather than nondeterministic) fashion. Under almost-sure
semantics (resp. positive semantics), the value of a word w is the largest real
v such that the runs over w have value at least v with probability 1 (resp.
positive probability).
  We study the classical questions of automata theory for probabilistic
weighted automata: emptiness and universality, expressiveness, and closure
under various operations on languages. For quantitative languages, emptiness
and universality are defined as whether the value of some (resp. every) word
exceeds a given threshold. We prove some of these questions to be decidable,
and others undecidable. Regarding expressive power, we show that probabilities
allow us to define a wide variety of new classes of quantitative languages,
except for discounted-sum automata, where probabilistic choice is no more
expressive than nondeterminism. Finally, we give an almost complete picture of
the closure of various classes of probabilistic weighted automata for the
following pointwise operations on quantitative languages: max, min, sum, and

making use of their system-specific-relationship (SSR), is generally referred
as the indirect measurement. Naturally the SSR may stand for a simple
data-translation process in a given case, but a set of equations, or even a
cascade of different such processes, in some other case. Further, though the
measurements are a priori ensured to be accurate, there is no definite method
for examining whether the result obtained at the end of an SSR, specifically a
cascade of SSRs, is really representative as the measured Xi-values.
  Of Course, it was recently shown that the uncertainty (ed) in the estimate
(yd) of a specified Yd is given by a specified linear combination of
corresponding measurement-uncertainties (uis). Here, further insight into this
principle is provided by its application to the cases represented by
cascade-SSRs. It is exemplified how the different stage-wise uncertainties
(Ied, IIed, ... ed), that is to say the requirements for the evaluation to be
successful, could even a priori be predicted. The theoretical tools (SSRs) have
resemblance with the real world measuring devices (MDs), and hence are referred
as also the data transformation scales (DTSs). However, non-uniform behavior
appears to be the feature of the DTSs rather than of the MDs.

$^{55}$Mn NMR in the temperature range 80K - 900K of ODM

established in the Paramagnetic (PM) phase for $T<700$K, induce a genuine
spin-glass state, which for $T<T_c$ consolidates with the Ferromagnetic (FM)
state into a single thermodynamic phase. Comparative NMR experiments on
La$_{0.77}$Ca$_{0.23}$MnO$_3$, La$_{0.59}$Ca$_{0.41}$MnO$_3$, and
La$_{0.70}$Sr$_{0.30}$MnO$_3$ demonstrate the dominant role of lattice
distortions, which appear to control (i) the stability of the spin glass phase
component and (ii) the kind (1st or 2nd order) of the PM-FM phase transition.
The experimental results are in agreement with the predictions of the
compressible random bond - random field Ising model, where consideration of a
strain field induced by lattice distortions, is shown to invoke at $T_c$ a
discontinuous (1st order like) change of both the FM and the ""glassy""

there is something wrong in the theory. Glaciations and deglaciations drive
changes of the sea level. Changes in the speed of Earths rotation during
glacial- interglacial transitions produce fracturing of the Earths crust and
major earthquakes along the fractures. The intensity of this process is as
higher as faster is the change of the sea level and as higher is its amplitude.
Much higher dimensions of this process may be caused by eruptive increasing of

noncommutative space-time is the apparent loss of Lorentz invariance that has
been addressed in different ways in the literature. One recently developed
approach is to eliminate the Lorentz violating effects by integrating over the
parameter of noncommutativity. Fundamental properties of such theories are
investigated in this thesis. Another issue addressed is model building, which
is difficult in the noncommutative setting due to severe restrictions on the
possible gauge symmetries imposed by the noncommutativity of the space-time.
Possible ways to relieve these restrictions are investigated and applied and a
noncommutative version of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is
presented. While putting the results obtained in the three original
publications into their proper context, the introductory part of this thesis
aims to provide an overview of the present situation in the field.

into dynamical models. The phase space dimension is typically much larger than
the number of ensemble members which leads to inaccurate results in the

to spurious long range correlations which can be eliminated by
Schur-product-based localization techniques. In this paper, we propose a new
technique for implementing such localization techniques within the class of
ensemble transform/square root Kalman filters. Our approach relies on a
continuous embedding of the Kalman filter update for the ensemble members,
i.e., we state an ordinary differential equation (ODE) whose solutions, over a
unit time interval, are equivalent to the Kalman filter update. The ODE
formulation forms a gradient system with the observations as a cost functional.
Besides localization, the new ODE ensemble formulation should also find useful
applications in the context of nonlinear observation operators and observations
arriving continuously in time.

was relatively low. Some episodes of very fast variability were detected in the
optical bands. The X-ray spectra are well fitted by a power law with photon
index of about 2 and photoelectric absorption exceeding the Galactic value.
However, when taking into account the presence of a molecular cloud on the line
of sight, the data are best fitted by a double power law, implying a concave
X-ray spectrum. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) built with
simultaneous radio-to-X-ray data at the epochs of the XMM-Newton observations
suggest that the peak of the synchrotron emission lies in the near-IR band, and
show a prominent UV excess, besides a slight soft-X-ray excess. A comparison
with the SEDs corresponding to previous observations with X-ray satellites
shows that the X-ray spectrum is extremely variable. We ascribe the UV excess
to thermal emission from the accretion disc, and the other broad-band spectral
features to the presence of two synchrotron components, with their related SSC
emission. We fit the thermal emission with a black body law and the non-thermal
components by means of a helical jet model. The fit indicates a disc

calculated for a $\Lambda$ hyperon using the SU(3) extension of in-medium

interactions arise from kaon-exchange and from two-pion-exchange with a

QCD vacuum, might be created during relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These
domains are predicted to lead to charge separation of quarks along the orbital
momentum of the system created in non-central collisions. To study this effect,
we investigate a three particle mixed harmonics azimuthal correlator which is a
\P-even observable, but directly sensitive to the charge separation effect. We
report measurements of this observable using the STAR detector in Au+Au and
Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 and 62~GeV. The results are presented
as a function of collision centrality, particle separation in rapidity, and
particle transverse momentum. A signal consistent with several of the
theoretical expectations is detected in all four data sets. We compare our
results to the predictions of existing event generators, and discuss in detail
possible contributions from other effects that are not related to parity
violation.

terms of an initial hyperkahler structure is presented. The equations to solve
are non linear in general, but become linear when the objects describing the
metric depend on only one complex coordinate of the hyperkahler 4-dimensional
space and its complex conjugated. This situation in particular gives a dual
description of D6-branes wrapping a complex 1-cycle inside the hyperkahler
space, which was studied by Fayyazuddin. The present work generalize the
construction given by him. But the explicit solutions we present correspond to
the non linear problem. This is a non linear equation with respect to two
variables which, with the help of some specific anzatz, is reduced to a non
linear equation with a single variable solvable in terms of elliptic functions.
In these terms we construct an infinite family of non compact Calabi-Yau
metrics.

candidate massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and ultra compact (UC) HII
regions from a sample of ~2000 MSX and 2MASS colour selected sources. Aims: To
search for H2O masers towards a large sample of young high mass stars and to
investigate the statistical correlation of H2O masers with the earliest stages
of massive star formation. Methods: We have used the Mopra Radio telescope to
make position-switched observations towards ~500 UCHII regions and MYSOs
candidates identified from the RMS survey and located between 190\degr < l <
30\degr. These observations have a 4$\sigma$ sensitivity of ~1 Jy and a
velocity resolution of ~0.4 km/s.} Results: We have detected 163 H2O masers,
approximately 75% of which were previously unknown. Comparing the maser
velocities with the velocities of the RMS sources, determined from 13CO
observations, we have identified 135 RMS-H2O maser associations, which
corresponds to a detection rate of ~27%. Taking into account the differences in
sensitivity and source selection we find our detection rate is in general
agreement with previously reported surveys. Conclusions: We find similar
detection rates for UCHII regions and MYSOs candidates, suggesting that the
conditions needed for maser activity are equally likely in these two stages of
the star formation process. Looking at the detection rate as a function of
distance from the Galactic centre we find it significantly enhanced within the
solar circle, peaking at ~37% between 6-7 kpc, which is consistent with
previous surveys of UC HII regions, possibly indicating the presence of a high
proportion of more luminous YSOs and HII regions.

starbursts and modestly starforming galaxies, but the relation between
starforming activity and PAH luminosity is still a matter of debate. The
different correlation degrees could be caused by the variety of optical and
far-infrared sample selection criteria. In order to obtain a census of the
typical properties of PAH emitting galaxies, we here study moderately distant
galaxies which have been selected by their PAH emission. Combining the ISOCAM
Parallel Survey at 6.7 micron with 2MASS we have colour-selected a sample of
120 candidates for strong PAH emission. We obtained optical and mid-infrared
spectra of 75 and 19 sources, respectively, and analysed IRAS-ADDSCANs and
available Spitzer 3.6-160 micron photometry. The Spitzer spectra exhibit clear
PAH features and corroborate that our photometric selection criteria trace the
PAH emission of galaxies fairly well. The optical spectra show emission lines,
at median redshift z~0.1, as well as Hdelta and CaII absorption, indicating
ongoing starformation as well as post-starbursts. The mid- and far-infrared
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) provide evidence for a broad range of
far-infrared (FIR) luminosities, but in general the dust is colder than for
starburst galaxies like M82. For most galaxies the monocromatic luminosity
peaks at about equal height at optical, 6.7 micron (PAH) and FIR wavelengths.
In about 15% of the sources the FIR luminosity exceeds the optical and PAH
energy output by about a factor 5-10 despite the cool dust temperature; in
these galaxies a large dust mass of 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun is inferred.

far coronal streamers (observed directly only from the space or stratosphere)
emit only in discrete regions of the visible spectrum like resonance
fluorescence of molecules and ions in comets. We found that interaction of the
coronal streamers with the dust corona can produce molecules and radicals,
which are known to cause the resonance fluorescence in comets.

of electrons between localized scattering potentials mediates long range forces

backscattering. We find that the long range forces between scatterers exhibit
the universal power law decay of the Casimir force in one dimension, with
prefactors that control the sign and strength of the interaction. These
prefactors are nonuniversal and depend on the symmetry and degree of
localization of the scattering potentials. We find that local potentials
inevitably lead to a coupled valley scattering problem, though by contrast
non-local potentials lead to two decoupled single-valley problems in a

potentials is characterized by the appearance of spatially periodic modulations
