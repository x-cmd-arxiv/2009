proposed by the authors is fully compatible with the cartography of the solar
system. First, this proposal posits that the phenomenon is an apparent
acceleration, not a real one, caused by a progressive desynchronization of the
astronomical and the atomic clock-times, after they had been synchronized at a
previous instant. The desynchronization could be caused by a coupling between
the background gravitation and the quantum vacuum. Therefore, the standard
argument for the incompatibility of the Pioneer acceleration and the values of
the planets' orbits radii cannot be applied. Second, this proposal gives
exactly the same results for radar ranging observations as standard physics.
Hence, it cannot be in conflict with the very precise cartography of the solar
system determined by NASA's Viking mission. Otherwise stated, while this
proposal predicts apparent changes in the velocities of the spaceships and in
the frequencies of Doppler observations, as really observed, it does not affect
the values of the distances in any way whatsoever. Note that an acceleration
between the astronomical and the atomic clock-times ({\it i. e.} a progressive
desynchronization) can not be discarded a priori as long as we will lack a
theory of quantum gravity.

explicable in terms of simple geometrical foreshortening. However, the
centre-to-limb visibility variation is much larger than that predicted by
foreshortening. Sunspot visibility is also known to be affected by the Wilson
effect: the apparent dish shape of the sunspot photosphere caused by the
temperature-dependent variation of the geometrical position of the tau=1 layer.
In this article we investigate the role of the Wilson effect on the sunspot
appearance distributions, deducing a mean depth for the umbral tau=1 layer of
500 to 1500 km. This is based on the comparison of observations of sunspot
longitude distribution and Monte Carlo simulations of sunspot appearance using

quadratic grand-canonical Hamiltonian shows that only pairs of distinct and
identical quasimomenta are coupled. Solving the corresponding Bogoliubov-de
Gennes equations we see that each pair of distinct quasimomenta gives raise to
doublets in the excitation energy spectrum and that the quasimomenta of the
zero-energy mode and of the occupied state in the condensates are identical.
The dynamical and energetic stabilities of the condensates are determined by
studying the behavior of the elementary excitations in the control parameters

Domain walls extend throughout the sample thickness in the direction of

structure becomes more intertwined and fine due to a decrease of the
orthorhombic distortion. This results in the energy landscape with maze-like

illuminating prehistorical events and serving as null models in genome scans

spectrum of genetic variants within and between populations. For candidate
models we numerically compute the expected spectrum using a diffusion
approximation to the one-locus two-allele Wright-Fisher process, involving up
to three simultaneous populations. Our approach is a composite likelihood
scheme, since linkage between neutral loci alters the variance but not the
expectation of the frequency spectrum. We thus use bootstraps incorporating
linkage to estimate uncertainties for parameters and significance values for
hypothesis tests. Our method can also incorporate selection on single sites,
predicting the joint distribution of selected alleles among populations
experiencing a bevy of evolutionary forces, including expansions, contractions,
migrations, and admixture. As applications, we model human expansion out of
Africa and the settlement of the New World, using 5 Mb of noncoding DNA
resequenced in 68 individuals from 4 populations (YRI, CHB, CEU, and MXL) by
the Environmental Genome Project. We also combine our demographic model with a
previously estimated distribution of selective effects among newly arising
amino acid mutations to accurately predict the frequency spectrum of
nonsynonymous variants across three continental populations (YRI, CHB, CEU).

formation is also taken into account in our model and is parametrized by the
frequency of explosions and modulations of activity. The numerical model
includes a magnetohydrodynamical dynamo driven by cosmic rays that is injected
into the interstellar medium by randomly exploding supernovae. In the model, we
also include essential elements such as vertical gravity of the disk,
differential rotation approximated by the shearing box, and resistivity leading
to magnetic reconnection. We find that even slow galactic rotation with a low
shearing rate amplifies the magnetic field, and that rapid rotation with a low
value of the shear enhances the efficiency of the dynamo. Our simulations have
shown that a high amount of magnetic energy leaves the simulation box becoming
an efficient source of intergalactic magnetic fields.

has been used as an automated segmentation method to transfer tumor/organ

computational time of DIR is insufficient for online ART. In this work, this
issue is addressed by using computer graphics processing units (GPUs). A
grey-scale based DIR algorithm called demons and five of its variants were
implemented on GPUs using the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
programming environment. The spatial accuracy of these algorithms was evaluated
over five sets of pulmonary 4DCT images with an average size of 256x256x100 and
more than 1,100 expert-determined landmark point pairs each. For all the

required around 7 to 11 seconds to yield an average 3D error ranging from 1.5

  Methods: The basic equations relating to VLBI astrometry are reviewed,

core-shifts, based on both observations and theoretical considerations of jet
conditions, is incorporated.
  Results: It is shown that, in the presence of core-shifts, phase and
group-delay astrometry measurements yield different positions. For a core
displacement from the jet base parametrized by Delta x (lambda) = k lambda^beta
group delays measure a ``reduced'' core-shift of (1-beta) Delta x (lambda). For
the astrophysically-significant case of beta = 1, group delays measure no shift
at all, giving the position of the jet base. At 8.4 GHz an estimated typical
offset between phase and group-delay positions of ~170 uas is smaller than the
current ~250 uas precision of group-delay positions of the sources used to
define the ICRF; however, this effect must be taken into account for future
measurements planned with improved accuracy when comparing with optical

understanding of the formation, structure and evolution of both the Sun and our
solar system. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which
the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this
review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric
composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of
nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D),
time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted
for departures from LTE whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive
and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly
noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new
solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal
consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with
values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the
solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find
a satisfactory resolution.

approximately thirty years ago. It has turned out to be an unusually fruitful
idea, crossing boundaries between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology.
An axion with mass of order $10^{-5}$ eV (with large uncertainties) is one of
the leading candidates for the dark matter of the universe. It was found
recently that dark matter axions thermalize and form a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC). Because they form a BEC, axions differ from ordinary cold dark matter
(CDM) in the non-linear regime of structure formation and upon entering the
horizon. Axion BEC provides a mechanism for the production of net overall
rotation in dark matter halos, and for the alignment of cosmic microwave
anisotropy multipoles. Because there is evidence for these phenomena,
unexplained with ordinary CDM, an argument can be made that the dark matter is
axions.

functional theory (TDDFT). Raman scattering cross sections are computed using a
formalism that employs analytical derivatives of frequency-dependent electronic
polarizabilities, which treats both off-resonant and resonant enhancement
within the same scheme. In the off-resonant regime, Raman scattering into
molecular vibrational modes is enhanced by one order of magnitude and shows
pronounced dependence on the orientation and the local symmetry of the
molecule. Additional strong enhancement of the order of $10^2$ arises from
resonant transitions to mixed metal--molecular electronic states. The Raman
enhancement is analyzed using Raman excitation profiles (REPs) for the range of
excitation energies $1.6-3.0$ eV, in which isolated benzenethiol does not have
electronic transitions. The computed vibrational frequency shifts and relative
Raman scattering cross sections of the metal--molecular complexes are in good
agreement with experimental data on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)
for benzenethiol adsorbed on silver surfaces. Characterization and
understanding of these effects, associated with chemical enhancement mechanism,
may be used to improve the detection sensitivity in molecular Raman scattering.

show that PTAs are also sensitive to mergers of supermassive black holes. While
these mergers occur on a timescale too short to be resolvable by a PTA, they
generate a change of metric due to non-linear gravitational-wave memory which
persists for the duration of the experiment and could be detected. We develop
the theory of the single-source detection by PTAs, and derive the sensitivity
of PTAs to the gravitational-wave memory jumps. We show that mergers of
$10^8M_{\odot}$ black holes are $2-\sigma$-detectable (in a direction,
polarization, and time-dependent way) out to co-moving distances of $\sim 1$
billion light years. Modern prediction for black-hole merger rates imply
marginal to modest chance of an individual jump detection by currently
developed PTAs. The sensitivity is expected to be somewhat higher for
futuristic PTA experiments with SKA.

objects in these three regions are similar in shape, suggesting, on average,
similar disk structures. When normalized to the same stellar luminosity, the
medians follow each other closely, implying comparable mid-infrared excess
emission from the circumstellar disks. We use the spectral index between 13 and
31 micron and the equivalent width of the 10 micron silicate emission feature
to identify objects whose disk configuration departs from that of a continuous,
optically thick accretion disk. Transitional disks, whose steep 13-31 micron
spectral slope and near-IR flux deficit reveal inner disk clearing, occur with
about the same frequency of a few percent in all three regions. Objects with
unusually large 10 micron equivalent widths are more common (20-30%); they
could reveal the presence of disk gaps filled with optically thin dust. Based
on their medians and fraction of evolved disks, T Tauri stars in Taurus and
Chamaeleon I are very alike. Disk evolution sets in early, since already the
youngest region, the Ophiuchus core (L1688), has more settled disks with larger
grains. Our results indicate that protoplanetary disks show clear signs of dust

adiabatic cooling after the initial shock breakout. This rapid decline and
upturn is reminiscent of the Type IIb SN 1993J on day six after the explosion.
Optical/near-IR spectra taken around the peak reveal prominent H-alpha, HeI,

series of separable terms, but this fact is only useful if the expansion can be
truncated at low order. The separable expansion provides an attractive
organizational scheme that incorporates the two body bound state in the leading

is of key importance for the study of planet formation and especially for the
transport of H2O and organic molecules to the surfaces of rocky
planets/satellites. Recent Spitzer observations have shown that the
mid-infrared spectra of protoplanetary disks are covered in emission lines due
to water and other molecules. Here, we present a non-LTE 2D radiative transfer
model of water lines in the 10-36 mum range that can be used to constrain the
abundance structure of water vapor, given an observed spectrum, and show that
an assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) does not accurately
estimate the physical conditions of the water vapor emission zones. By applying
the model to published Spitzer spectra we find that: 1) most water lines are
subthermally excited, 2) the gas-to-dust ratio must be one to two orders of
magnitude higher than the canonical interstellar medium ratio of 100-200, and
3) the gas temperature must be higher than the dust temperature, and 4) the
water vapor abundance in the disk surface must be truncated beyond ~ 1 AU. A
low efficiency of water formation below ~ 300 K may naturally result in a lower
water abundance beyond a certain radius. However, we find that chemistry, may
not be sufficient to produce an abundance drop of many orders of magnitude and
speculate that the depletion may also be caused by vertical turbulent diffusion
of water vapor from the superheated surface to regions below the snow line,
where the water can freeze out and be transported to the midplane as part of
the general dust settling. Such a vertical cold finger effect is likely to be
efficient due to the lack of a replenishment mechanism of large, water-ice
coated dust grains to the disk surface.

receptor (ER) isoforms in the rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Previous
phylogenetic analysis indicates that a whole genome duplication prior to the
divergence of ray-finned fish led to two distinct ER beta isoforms, ER beta 1
and ER beta 2, and the recent whole genome duplication in the ancestral
salmonid created two ER alpha isoforms, ER alpha 1 and ER alpha 2. The
objective of our computational studies is to provide insight into the
underlying evolutionary pressures on these isoforms. For the ER alpha subtype
our results show that E2 binds preferentially to ER alpha 1 over ER alpha 2.
Tests of lineage specific dN/dS ratios indicate that the ligand binding domain
of the ER alpha 2 gene is evolving under relaxed selection relative to all
other ER alpha genes. Comparison with the highly conserved DNA binding domain
suggests that ER alpha 2 may be undergoing neofunctionalization possibly by
binding to another ligand. By contrast, both ER beta 1 and ER beta 2 bind
similarly to E2 and the best fitting model of selection indicates that the
ligand binding domain of all ER beta genes are evolving under the same level of
purifying selection, comparable to ER alpha 1.

significant probability, generate nonclassical correlations that violate a Bell
inequality. For n parties using a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, this
probability of violation rapidly tends to unity as the number of parties

are metal-poor, with [Fe/H] < -2.5, and were selected from our ongoing survey
of extremely metal-poor dwarf candidates from the Sloan Digital SkySurvey
(SDSS). The carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances rely on molecular lines
which form in the outer layers of the stellar atmosphere. It is known that
convection in metal-poor stars induces very low temperatures which are not
predicted by `classical' 1D stellar atmospheres. To obtain the correct
temperature structure, one needs full 3D hydrodynamical models. Using CO5BOLD
3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres and the Linfor3D line formation code,
molecular lines of CH, NH, OH and C2 were computed, and 3D carbon, nitrogen and
oxygen abundances were determined. The resulting carbon abundances were
compared to abundances derived using atomic CI lines in 1D LTE and NLTE. There
is not a good agreement between the carbon abundances determined from C2 bands
and from the CH band, and molecular lines do not agree with the atomic CI
lines. Although this may be partly due to uncertainties in the transition
probabilities of the molecular bands it certainly has to do with the
temperature structure of the outer layers of the adopted model atmosphere. We
explore the influence of the 3D model properties on the molecular abundance
determination. In particular, the choice of the number of opacity bins used in
the model calculations and its subsequent effects on the temperature structure
and molecular line formation is discussed. (Abridged)

tradeoff for both FDD and TDD systems, when both receiver and transmitter
knowledge about the channel is noisy and potentially mismatched. For FDD
systems, we first extend the achievable tradeoff region for 1.5 rounds of
message passing to get higher diversity compared to the best known scheme, in
the regime of higher multiplexing gains. We then break the mold of all current
channel state based protocols by using multiple rounds of conferencing to
extract more bits about the actual channel. This iterative refinement of the
channel increases the diversity order with every round of communication. The
protocols are on-demand in nature, using high powers for training and feedback
only when the channel is in poor states. The key result is that the diversity
multiplexing tradeoff with perfect training and K levels of perfect feedback
can be achieved, even when there are errors in training the receiver and errors
in the feedback link, with a multi-round protocol which has K rounds of
training and K-1 rounds of binary feedback. The above result can be viewed as a
generalization of Zheng and Tse, and Aggarwal and Sabharwal, where the result
was shown to hold for K=1 and K=2 respectively. For TDD systems, we also
develop new achievable strategies with multiple rounds of communication between
the transmitter and the receiver, which use the reciprocity of the forward and
the feedback channel. The multi-round TDD protocol achieves a
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff which uniformly dominates its FDD counterparts,
where no channel reciprocity is available.

characterized by the appearance of a zone of rapid modulated oscillations. An
asymptotic description of these oscillations is given, for short times, by the
one-phase solution to the CH equation, where the branch points of the
corresponding elliptic curve depend on the physical coordinates via the Whitham
equations. We present a conjecture for the phase of the asymptotic solution. A
numerical study of this limit for smooth hump-like initial data provides strong
evidence for the validity of this conjecture. We present a quantitative
numerical comparison between the CH and the asymptotic solution. The dependence
on the small dispersion parameter $\epsilon$ is studied in the interior and at
the boundaries of the Whitham zone. In the interior of the zone, the difference
between CH and asymptotic solution is of the order $\epsilon$, at the trailing
edge of the order $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ and at the leading edge of the order
$\epsilon^{1/3}$. For the latter we present a multiscale expansion which
describes the amplitude of the oscillations in terms of the Hastings-McLeod
solution of the Painlev\'e II equation. We show numerically that this

dimensions and dual resonance models in D' dimensions, where D' may differ from
D. Dual resonance models, pioneered by Veneziano, were forerunners of string
theory. The analog of scattering amplitudes are called Mellin amplitudes; they
depend on complex variables which substitute for the Mandelstam variables on
which scattering amplitudes depend. The Mellin amplitudes satisfy exact duality
- i.e. meromorphy with simple poles in single variables, and crossing symmetry
- and an appropriate form of factorization which is implied by operator product
expansions (OPE). Duality is a D-independent property. The positions of the
leading poles are given by the dimensions of fields in the OPE; their residues
depend on D and determine satellites. Dimensional reduction and induction D
goes to D-1 and D+1 are discussed. Dimensional reduction leads to the
appearence of Anti de Sitter space.

Muon Detector Network on December 14, 2006. An intense geomagnetic storm is
also recorded during this FD with the peak Kp index of 8+. By using the
""two-dimensional map"" of the cosmic ray intensity produced after removing the
contribution from the diurnal anisotropy, we succeed in extracting clear
signatures of the precursor. A striking feature of this event is that a weak
loss-cone signature is first recorded more than a day prior to the Storm Sudden
Commencement (SSC) onset. This suggests that the loss-cone precursor appeared
only 7 hours after the Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) eruption from the Sun, when
the Interplanetary (IP) shock driven by the Interplanetary Coronal Mass
Ejection (ICME) located at 0.4 AU from the Sun. We find the precursor being
successively observed with multiple detectors in the network according to the
Earth's spin and confirmed that the precursor continuously exists in space. The
long lead time (15.6 hours) of this precursor which is almost twice the typical
value indicates that the IMF was more quiet in this event than a typical power
spectrum assumed for the IMF turbulence. The amplitude (-6.45 %) of the
loss-cone anisotropy at the SSC onset is more than twice the FD size,
indicating that the maximum intensity depression behind the IP shock is much
larger than the FD size recorded at the Earth in this event. We also find the
excess intensity from the sunward IMF direction clearly observed during ~10
hours preceding the SSC onset. It is shown that this excess intensity is
consistent with the measurement of the particles accelerated by the head-on
collisions with the approaching shock. This is the first detailed observation
of the precursor due to the shock reflected particles with muon detectors.

the Tibet Air Shower (AS) experiment still awaits theoretical interpretation.
The observed global feature of the anisotropy is well reproduced by a
superposition of the bi-directional and uni-directional flows (BDF and UDF,
respectively) of GCRs. If the orientation of the deduced BDF represents the
orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field (LISMF), as indicated by
best-fitting a model to the data, the UDF deviating from the BDF orientation
implies a significant contribution from the streaming perpendicular to the
LISMF. This perpendicular streaming is probably due to the drift anisotropy,
because the contribution from the perpendicular diffusion is expected to be
much smaller than the drift effect. The large amplitude deduced for the UDF
indicates a large spatial gradient of the GCR density. We suggest that such a
density gradient can be expected at the heliosphere sitting close to the
boundary of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC), if the LIC is expanding. The
spatial distribution of GCR density in the LIC reaches a stationary state
because of the balance between the inward cross-field diffusion and the
adiabatic cooling due to the expansion. We derive the steady-state distribution
of GCR density in the LIC based on radial transport of GCRs in a spherical LIC
expanding at a constant rate. By comparing the expected gradient with the
observation by Tibet experiment, we estimate the perpendicular diffusion
coefficient of multi-TeV GCRs in the local interstellar space.
