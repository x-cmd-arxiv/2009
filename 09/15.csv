technique to newly-released 1.1micron Y-band images from WFC3 on HST. By
comparing these images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field with the ACS z'-band
(0.85micron), we identify objects with red colours, (z'-Y)_AB>1.3), consistent
with the Ly-alpha forest absorption at z~6.7-8.8. We identify 12 of these
z'-drops down to a limiting magnitude Y_AB<28.5 (equivalent to a star formation
rate of 1.3M_sun/yr at z=7.1), which are undetected in the other ACS filters.
We use the WFC3 J-band image to eliminate contaminant low mass Galactic stars,
which typically have redder colours than z~7 galaxies. One of our z'-drops is a
probably a T-dwarf star. The z~7 z'-drops have much bluer spectral slopes than
Lyman-break galaxies at lower redshift. Our brightest z'-drop is not present in
the NICMOS J-band image of the same field taken 5 years before, and is a
possible transient object. From the 10 remaining z~7 candidates we determine a
lower limit on the star formation rate density of 0.0017M_sun/yr/Mpc^3 for a
Salpeter initial mass function, which rises to 0.0025-0.0034M_sun/yr/Mpc^3
after correction for luminosity bias. The star formation rate density is a
factor of ~10 less than that at z=3-4, and is about half the value at z~6.
While based on a single deep field, our results suggest that this star
formation rate density would produce insufficient Lyman continuum photons to
reionize the Universe unless the escape fraction of these photons is extremely
high (f_esc>0.5), and the clumping factor of the Universe is low. Even then, we
need to invoke a large contribution from galaxies below our detection limit.
The apparent shortfall in ionizing photons might be alleviated if stellar
populations at high redshift are low metallicity or have a top-heavy IMF.

performed full SED fitting to the optical+infrared photometry of all
high-redshift galaxy candidates detected at greater than 5-sigma in at least
one of the WFC3/IR broad-band filters. After rejection of contaminants, the
result is a sample of 49 galaxies with primary redshift solutions z > 5.9. Our
sample, selected without recourse to specific colour cuts, re-selects all but
the faintest one of the 16 z-drops selected by Oesch et al. (2009), recovers
all 5 of the Y-drops reported by Bouwens et al. (2009), and adds a further 29
galaxy candidates, of which 12 lie beyond z = 6.3, and 4 lie beyond z = 7. We
also present confidence intervals on our photometric redshift estimates, and
caution that acceptable low-redshift (z < 2) solutions exist for 28 out of the
37 galaxies at z > 6.3, and for all 8 galaxy candidates at z > 7.5.
Nevertheless, the very highest redshift candidates appear to be strongly
clustered in the field. We derive new estimates of the ultraviolet galaxy
luminosity function at z = 7 and z = 8. Where our results are most robust, at a
characteristic luminosity M(1500) ~ -19.5 (AB), we find that the comoving
number density of galaxies declines by a factor of ~ 2.5 between z = 6 and z =

difficult for the observed population of high-redshift star-forming galaxies to
achieve reionisation by z ~ 6 without a significant contribution from galaxies
well below the detection limits, plus alterations in the escape fraction of
ionising photons and/or continued vigorous star formation at z > 15.

  spectral filter","42 pages, 9 figures",,"10.1063/1.3266948",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the scale-locality of subgrid-scale (SGS) energy flux and
inter-band energy transfers defined by the sharp spectral filter. We show by
rigorous bounds, physical arguments and numerical simulations that the spectral
SGS flux is dominated by local triadic interactions in an extended turbulent
inertial-range. Inter-band energy transfers are also shown to be dominated by
local triads if the spectral bands have constant width on a logarithmic scale.
We disprove in particular an alternative picture of ``local transfer by
nonlocal triads,'' with the advecting wavenumber mode at the energy peak.
Although such triads have the largest transfer rates of all {\it individual}
wavenumber triads, we show rigorously that, due to their restricted number,
they make an asymptotically negligible contribution to energy flux and
log-banded energy transfers at high wavenumbers in the inertial-range. We show
that it is only the aggregate effect of a geometrically increasing number of
local wavenumber triads which can sustain an energy cascade to small scales.
Furthermore, non-local triads are argued to contribute even less to the
space-average energy flux than is implied by our rigorous bounds, because of
additional cancellations from scale-decorrelation effects. We can thus recover
the -4/3 scaling of nonlocal contributions to spectral energy flux predicted by
Kraichnan's ALHDIA and TFM closures. We support our results with numerical data
from a $512^3$ pseudospectral simulation of isotropic turbulence with
phase-shift dealiasing. We conclude that the sharp spectral filter has a firm
theoretical basis for use in large-eddy simulation (LES) modeling of turbulent
flows.

to have been observed by the LAT, which detected several hundred photons during
the prompt phase. With a redshift of z = 1.822, this burst is among the most
luminous detected by Fermi. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a
significant power-law component in the LAT data that is distinct from the usual
Band model emission that is seen in the sub-MeV energy range. This power-law
component appears to extrapolate from the GeV range to the lowest energies and
is more intense than the Band component both below $\sim$ 50 keV and above 100
MeV. The Band component undergoes substantial spectral evolution over the
entire course of the burst, while the photon index of the power-law component
remains constant for most of the prompt phase, then hardens significantly
towards the end. After the prompt phase, power-law emission persists in the LAT
data as late as 1 ks post-trigger, with its flux declining as $t^{-1.5}$. The
LAT detected a photon with the highest energy so far measured from a GRB,
$33.4_{-3.5}^{+2.7}$ GeV. This event arrived 82 seconds after the GBM trigger
and $\sim$ 50 seconds after the prompt phase emission had ended in the GBM
band. We discuss the implications of these results for models of GRB emission

at the level of <=100 micro-arcseconds a number of effects are limiting the
accuracy. Most important are the imperfectly subtracted seeing halos of
neighboring stars, residual image distortions and unrecognized confusion of the
target source with fainter sources in the background. Further contributors to
the error budget are the uncertainty in estimating the point spread function,
the signal-to-noise ratio induced statistical uncertainty, coordinate
transformation errors, the chromaticity of refraction in Earth's atmosphere,
the post adaptive optics differential tilt jitter and anisoplanatism. For stars
as bright as mK=14, residual image distortions limit the astrometry, for
fainter stars the limitation is set by the seeing halos of the surrounding
stars. In order to improve the astrometry substantially at the current
generation of telescopes, an adaptive optics system with high performance and
weak seeing halos over a relatively small field (r<=3"") is suited best.
Furthermore, techniques to estimate or reconstruct the seeing halo could be
promising.

bundle tips. In mean field, we determine the bundle size distribution to be
broad for bundle sizes smaller than a characteristic bundle size above which
the distribution decays exponentially. Two-dimensional simulations
incorporating both bundling and cross-linking measure a bundle size
distribution that agrees qualitatively with mean field. The simulations also
demonstrate a nonmonotonicity in the radial extent of the dendritic region as a
function of capping protein concentration, as was observed in experiments, due
to the interplay between percolation and the ratcheting of growing filaments
off a spherical obstacle.

pair production at hadron colliders without color exchange between the squarks.
This can give rise to events where little or no energy is deposited in the
detector between the squark decay products. We discuss the potential for
detection of such rapidity gap events at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our
numerical analysis is divided into two parts. First, we evaluate in a
simplified framework the rapidity gap signal at the parton level. The second
part covers an analysis with full event simulation using PYTHIA as well as
Herwig++, but without detector simulation. We analyze the transverse energy
deposited between the jets from squark decay, as well as the probability of
finding a third jet in between the two hardest jets. For the mSUGRA benchmark
point SPS1a we find statistically significant evidence for a color singlet
exchange contribution. The systematical differences between current versions of
PYTHIA and HERWIG++ are larger than the physical effect from color singlet
exchange; however, these systematic differences could be reduced by tuning both
Monte Carlo generators on normal QCD di--jet data.

described by the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, an important step is the
construction, from the wave function, of a probability distribution answering
various questions of physical interest, such as the probability of the system
entering a given region of configuration space at any stage in its entire
history. A standard but heuristic procedure is to use the flux of (components
of) the wave function in a WKB approximation. This gives sensible semiclassical
results but lacks an underlying operator formalism. In this paper, we address
the issue of constructing probability distributions linked to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation using the decoherent histories approach to quantum
theory. We show that the appropriate class operators (the generalization of
strings of projectors) in quantum cosmology are readily constructed using a
complex potential. We derive the class operator for entering or not entering
one or more regions in configuration space. They commute with the Hamiltonian,
have a sensible classical limit and are closely related to intersection number
operators. We show that oscillatory WKB solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation give approximate decoherence of histories, as do superpositions of WKB
solutions, as long as the regions of configuration space are sufficiently
large. The corresponding probabilities coincide, in a semiclassical
approximation, with standard heuristic procedures. In brief, we exhibit the
well-defined operator formalism underlying the usual heuristic interpretational
methods in quantum cosmology.

produced by a grid is experimentally investigated. Experiments have been
performed in a channel mounted in the large-scale 'Coriolis' rotating platform,
and measurements have been carried out in the planes normal and parallel to the
rotation axis using particle image velocimetry. After a short period of about
0.4 tank rotation where the energy decays as $t^{-6/5}$, as in classical
isotropic turbulence, the energy follows a shallower decay law compatible with
$t^{-3/5}$, as dimensionally expected for energy transfers governed by the
linear timescale $\Omega^{-1}$. The crossover occurs at a Rossby number $Ro
\simeq 0.25$, without noticeable dependence with the grid Rossby number. After
this transition, anisotropy develops in the form of vertical layers where the
initial vertical velocity remains trapped. These layers of nearly constant
vertical velocity become thinner as they are advected and stretched by the
large-scale horizontal flow, producing significant horizontal gradient of
vertical velocity which eventually become unstable. After the $Ro \simeq 0.25$
transition, the vertical vorticity field first develops a cyclone-anticyclone
asymmetry, reproducing the growth law of the vorticity skewness, $S_\omega(t)
\simeq (\Omega t)^{0.7}$, reported by Morize, Moisy & Rabaud [{\it Phys.
Fluids} {\bf 17} (9), 095105 (2005)]. At larger time, however, the vorticity
skewness decreases and eventually returns to zero. The present results indicate
that the shear instability of the vertical layers contribute significantly to
the re-symmetrisation of the vertical vorticity at large time, by re-injecting
vorticity fluctuations of random sign at small scales. These results emphasize
the importance of the initial conditions in the decay of rotating turbulence.

groups. These observations imply a highly directional beam of light and jet of
particles, with initial collimation factors in excess of 10,000, velocities in
excess of 0.95 c, as an impulsive event involving up to 0.00001 solar masses,
which interacts with circumstellar material. The jet and beam coincide with the
194 degree angle of the bipolarity on the sky, and are oriented at 75 degrees
to the line of sight to the Earth. By day 30 the collimation of the jet
decreases, and its velocity declines to ~0.5 c. These observations and the
resulting kinematic solution can be understood in terms of pulsar emission from
polarization currents, induced by the periodically modulated electromagnetic
field beyond the pulsar light cylinder, which are thus modulated at up to many
times the speed of light. With plasma available at many times the light
cylinder radius, as would be the case for a spinning neutron star formed at the
center of its progenitor, pulsed emission is directed close to the rotation
axis, eviscerating this progenitor, and continuing for months to years, until
very little circumpulsar material remains. This model provides a candidate for
the central engine of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) mechanism, both long and short,

the interface. Our main result is that the limiting process is a semimartingale

the interface, so that the limiting diffusion is not necessarily reversible. We
also exhibit an explicit way of identifying its parameters in terms of the

Demonstrations that a hidden-variable program necessarily requires outcomes of

called ""no-go theorems"". The Bell theorem excludes local hidden variable
theories. The Kochen-Specker theorem excludes noncontextual hidden variable
theories. In local hidden-variable theories faster-that-light-influences are

some fundamental quantum characteristics must be behind better-than-classical
performance of information processing tasks. This chapter aims at establishing
connections between certain quantum information protocols and foundational
issues in quantum theory. After a brief discusion of the most common

Zwanziger's horizon function, the ghost dressing function and Kugo's functions
$u$ and $w$. We agree with this result as far as bare quantities are
considered. However, assuming the validity of the horizon gap equation, we
argue that the solution $w(0)=0$ is not acceptable since it would lead to a
vanishing renormalised ghost dressing function. On the contrary, when the
cut-off goes to infinity, $u(0) \to \infty$, $w(0) \to -\infty$ such that
$u(0)+w(0) \to -1$. Furthermore $w$ and $u$ are not multiplicatively
renormalisable. Relaxing the gap equation allows $w(0)=0$ with $u(0) \to -1$.
In both cases the bare ghost dressing function, $F(0,\Lambda)$, goes
logarithmically to infinity at infinite cut-off. We show that, although the
lattice results provide bare results not so different from the $F(0,\Lambda)=3$
solution, this is an accident due to the fact that the lattice cut-offs lie in
the range 1-3 GeV$^{-1}$. We show that the renormalised ghost dressing function
should be finite and non-zero at zero momentum and can be reliably estimated on
the lattice up to powers of the lattice spacing ; from published data on a
$80^4$ lattice at $\beta=5.7$ we obtain $F_R(0,\mu=1.5$ GeV)$\simeq 2.2$.

tails by Kuepper, Macleod & Heggie (2008) we investigate a more comprehensive
set of N-body models of star clusters on orbits about a Milky-Way-like
potential. We find that the predicted epicyclic overdensities arise in any
tidal tail no matter which orbit the cluster follows as long as the cluster
lives long enough for the overdensities to build up.
  The distance of the overdensities along the tidal tail from the cluster
centre depends for circular orbits only on the mass of the cluster and the
strength of the tidal field, and therefore decreases monotonically with time,
while for eccentric orbits the orbital motion influences the distance, causing
a periodic compression and stretching of the tails and making the distance
oscillate with time. We provide an approximation for estimating the distance of
the overdensities in this case.
  We describe an additional type of overdensity which arises in extended tidal
tails of clusters on eccentric orbits, when the acceleration of the tidal field
on the stellar stream is no longer homogeneous. Moreover, we conclude that a
pericentre passage or a disk shock is not the direct origin of an overdensity
within a tidal tail. Escape due to such tidal perturbations does not take place
immediately after the perturbation but is rather delayed and spread over the
orbit of the cluster. All observable overdensities are therefore of the
mentioned two types. In particular, we note that substructured tidal tails do
not imply the existence of dark-matter sub-structures in the haloes of
galaxies.

of finding the optimal input covariance matrix that achieves secrecy capacity
subject to a power constraint, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem
that is in general difficult to solve. Existing results for this problem
address the case in which the transmitter and the legitimate receiver have two
antennas each and the eavesdropper has one antenna. For the general cases, it
has been shown that the optimal input covariance matrix has low rank when the
difference between the Grams of the eavesdropper and the legitimate receiver
channel matrices is indefinite or semi-definite, while it may have low rank or
full rank when the difference is positive definite. In this paper, the
aforementioned non-convex optimization problem is investigated. In particular,
for the multiple-input single-output (MISO) wiretap channel, the optimal input
covariance matrix is obtained in closed form. For general cases, we derive the
necessary conditions for the optimal input covariance matrix consisting of a
set of equations. For the case in which the transmitter has two antennas, the
derived necessary conditions can result in a closed form solution; For the case
in which the difference between the Grams is indefinite and has all negative
eigenvalues except one positive eigenvalue, the optimal input covariance matrix
has rank one and can be obtained in closed form; For other cases, the solution
is proved to be a fixed point of a mapping from a convex set to itself and an
iterative procedure is provided to search for it. Numerical results are
presented to illustrate the proposed theoretical findings.

biochemical building blocks, many biochemical systems require high sensitivity
to small molecular differences. The first and most common model used to explain
this high specificity is kinetic proofreading, which has been extended to a
variety of systems from detection of DNA mismatch to cell signaling processes.
While the specification properties of the kinetic proofreading model are well
known and were studied in various contexts, very little is known about its
temporal behavior. In this work, we study the dynamical properties of discrete
stochastic two branch kinetic proofreading schemes. Using the Laplace transform
of the corresponding chemical master equation, we obtain an analytical solution
for the completion time distribution. In particular we provide expressions for
the specificity and the mean and the variance of the process completion times.
We also show that, for a wide range of parameters a process distinguishing

process. Our results allow for the systematic study of the interplay between
specificity and completion times as well as testing the validity of the kinetic

exponential decay, leveling off towards its quiescent level. The exponential
decay timescale is ~4 days and the quiescent flux corresponds to a luminosity
of 3x10^32 (d/7.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. This together with the relation between
quiescent X-ray luminosity and orbital period reported in the literature
suggests that H1743-322 has an orbital period longer than ~10 hours. Both the
radio and X-ray light curve show evidence for flares. The radio - X-ray
correlation can be well described by a power-law with index ~0.18. This is much
lower than the index of 0.6-0.7 found for the decay of several black hole
transients before. The radio spectral index measured during one of the radio
flares while the source is in the low-hard state, is -0.5+-0.15, which
indicates that the radio emission is optically thin. This is unlike what has
been found before in black hole sources in the low-hard state. We attribute the
radio flares and the low index for the radio - X-ray correlation to the
presence of shocks downstream the jet flow, triggered by ejection events
earlier in the outburst. We find no evidence for a change in X-ray power law
spectral index during the decay, although the relatively high extinction of N_H

It is generally thought to begin as a subsonic deflagration, but this may
transition into a supersonic detonation (the DDT). We argue that this
transition leads to a breakout shock, which would provide the first unambiguous
evidence that DDTs occur. Its main features are a hard X-ray flash (~20 keV)
lasting ~0.01 s with a total radiated energy of ~10^{40} ergs, followed by a
cooling tail. This creates a distinct feature in the visual light curve, which
is separate from the nickel decay. This cooling tail has a maximum absolute
visual magnitude of M_V = -9 to -10 at approximately 1 day, which depends most
sensitively on the white dwarf radius at the time of the DDT. As the thermal
diffusion wave moves in, the composition of these surface layers may be
imprinted as spectral features, which would help to discern between SN Ia
progenitor models. Since this feature should accompany every SNe Ia, future
deep surveys (e.g., m=24) will see it out to a distance of approximately 80
Mpc, giving a maximum rate of ~60/yr. Archival data sets can also be used to
study the early rise dictated by the shock heating (at about 20 days before
maximum B-band light). A similar and slightly brighter event may also accompany
core bounce during the accretion induced collapse to a neutron star, but with a

understanding how the merging environment affects the cluster constituents.
Here, temperature maps are presented along with the Chandra X-ray images. A
dichotomy is found in the sample in that there exists a subsample of cold front
clusters which are clearly mergers based on their X-ray morphologies, and a
second subsample which harbor cold fronts, but have surprisingly relaxed X-ray
morphologies, and minimal evidence for merger activity at other wavelengths.
For this second subsample, the existence of a cold front provides the sole
evidence for merger activity at X-ray wavelengths. We discuss how cold fronts
can provide additional information which may be used to constrain merger
histories, and also the possibility of using cold fronts to distinguish major
and minor mergers.

ratio may be higher in our 24um-bright sample of DOGs than in SMGs and other
Spitzer-selected sources. Although larger sample sizes are needed to provide a
definitive conclusion, the data are consistent with an evolutionary trend in
which the formation of massive galaxies at z~2 involves a sub-millimeter

turbulence stirs particles, but can also seed collapse by clumping them. While
the feedback of solids on gas triggers vertical shear instabilities that
obstruct self-gravity, this same feedback triggers streaming instabilities that
strongly concentrate particles. Numerical simulations find that solids 10-100
cm in size gravitationally collapse in turbulent disks. We outline areas for
progress, including the possibility that still smaller objects self-gravitate.

SUSY left-right symmetric and Pati-Salam models and show how the various scales
appearing in these models have to be chosen in order to achieve unification. We
find that unification in the considered models occurs typically at scales below
M^{min}_{B violation} = 10^16 GeV, implying potential conflicts with the
non-observation of proton decay. We emphasize that extending the particle
content of a model in order to push the GUT scale higher or to achieve
unification in the first place will very often lead to non-perturbative
evolution. We generalize this observation to arbitrary extensions of the
Standard Model and of the MSSM and show that the requirement of perturbativity
up to M^{min}_{B violation}, if considered a valid guideline for model
building, severely limits the particle content of any such model, especially in
the supersymmetric case. However, we also discuss several mechanisms to
circumvent perturbativity and proton decay issues, for example in certain
classes of extra dimensional models.

ratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV
ratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted
to redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts. The star formation
history (SFH) is identified as the main driver of this departure. We have also
derived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction of
the dust mass contributed by PAHs, the fraction of the dust mass heated by very
intense starlight and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains.
The dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale-length being constant
from Sb to Sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale-length). Many
S0/a-Sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions.
The PAH abundance increases with metallicity for 12+\log(O/H)<9, and at larger
metallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the SFH being a
plausible underlying driver for this behavior. The dust-to-gas ratio is also
well correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentric
radius.

(Marois et al. 2008) and Fomalhaut (Kalas et al. 2008) present a new challenge
for planet formation theorists. Our goal is to figure out which of three giant
planet formation mechanisms--core accretion (with or without migration),
scattering from the inner disk, or gravitational instability--could be
responsible for Fomalhaut b, HR 8799 b, c and d, and similar planets discovered
in the future. This paper presents the results of numerical experiments
comparing the long-period planet formation efficiency of each possible
mechanism in model A star, G star and M star disks.
  First, a simple core accretion simulation shows that planet cores forming
beyond 35 AU cannot reach critical mass, even under the most favorable
conditions one can construct. Second, a set of N-body simulations demonstrates
that planet-planet scattering does not create stable, wide-orbit systems such
as HR 8799. Finally, a linear stability analysis verifies previous work showing
that global spiral instabilities naturally arise in high-mass disks. We
conclude that massive gas giants on stable orbits with semimajor axes greater
than 35 AU form by gravitational instability in the disk. We recommend that
observers examine the planet detection rate as a function of stellar age,
controlling for planet dimming with time. If planet detection rate is found to
be independent of stellar age, it would confirm our prediction that
gravitational instability is the dominant mode of producing detectable planets
on wide orbits. We also predict that the occurrence ratio of long-period to
short-period gas giants should be highest for M dwarfs due to the inefficiency
of core accretion and the expected small fragment mass in their disks.

can survive at LHC energy in models with a larger saturation scale. We show
that both shadowing and saturation effects are important at LHC in p+A

crucial in order to understand the underlying dynamics of heavy ion collisions.

abundance determinations predicts the base of the solar convective envelope to
be located at $R_{\rm CZ}= 0.724{\rm R_\odot}$ and a surface helium mass
fraction of $Y_{\rm surf}=0.231$. These results are in conflict with

change needed is $\sim 5%$. The required change at the base of the convective
envelope is about half the value estimated previously. We also present the

Detection of the presence of a spin-1/2 system in a given spin state by a
freely-moving two-state observer illustrates the features of the model and the
nonperturbative computational methodology. With the help of perturbation theory
the model is applied to a calculation of the quintessential ""nonlocal"" quantum

understood if the variable optical continuum emission is generated in the

ejection of knots of high-energy electrons that are accelerated in the jet flow

frequencies from radio to X-ray bands. In this scenario, the beamed optical
continuum emission from the jet and counterjet ionizes a gas in a

two outflowing conical regions with broad emission lines (in addition to the
conventional broad line region around the central nucleus).

Frequency spectra of electron spin noise are studied as a function of electron
density, magnetic field, temperature, probe laser wavelength and intensity, and
interaction volume. Electron spin lifetimes $\tau_s$ are inferred from the
width of the spin noise spectra, and are compared with direct measurements of
$\tau_s$ using conventional Hanle effect methods. Both methods reveal a strong

on the nominally `non-perturbative' spin noise measurements. As a function of
temperature, the spin noise power increases approximately linearly from 1.5 K
to 30 K, as expected for degenerate electrons obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics,
but with an additional zero-temperature offset. Finally, as the cross-sectional
area of the probe laser shrinks and fewer electrons are probed, the measured
Faraday rotation fluctuations due to electron spin noise are shown to increase,
as expected.

one parameter, the ratio between total genetic map length ($G$) and physical
map length ($P$), measured in centiMorgans per Megabase (cM/Mb). The value of
this parameter varies greatly between species, but the cause for these
differences is not entirely clear. A constraining factor of overall $RR$ in a
species, which may cause increased $RR$ for smaller chromosomes, is the
requirement of at least one chiasma per chromosome (or chromosome-arm) per
meiosis. In the present study, we quantify the relative excess of recombination
events on smaller chromosomes by a linear regression model, which relates the
genetic length of chromosomes to their physical length. We find for several
species that the two-parameter regression, $G= G_0 + k \cdot P$ provides a
better characterization of the relationship between genetic and physical map
length than the one-parameter regression that runs through the origin. A
non-zero intercept ($G_0$) indicates a relative excess of recombination on
smaller chromosomes in a genome. Given $G_0$, the parameter $k$ predicts the
increase of genetic map length over the increase of physical map length. The
observed values of $G_0$ have a similar magnitude for diverse species, whereas
$k$ varies by two orders of magnitude. The implications of this strategy for

of the chiral QCD Lagrangian, once embedded in a non-trivial spacetime, gives
rise to a cosmological vacuum energy density which can be can be presented
entirely in terms of QCD parameters and the Hubble constant $H$ as
$\rho_\Lambda \simeq H \cdot m_q\la\bar{q}q\ra /m_{\eta'} \sim (4.3\cdot
10^{-3} \text{eV})^4$. In this work we focus on the dynamics of the ghost
fields that are essential ingredients of the aforementioned Lagrangian. In
particular, we argue that the Veneziano ghost, being unphysical in the usual
Minkowski QFT, becomes a physical degree of freedom if the universe is
expanding. As an immediate consequence, all relevant effects are naturally very
small as they are proportional to the rate of expansion $H/ \Lqcd \sim
10^{-41}$. The co-existence of these two drastically different scales ($\Lqcd
\sim 100 $ MeV and $H \sim 10^{-33}$ eV) is a direct consequence of the
auxiliary conditions on the physical Hilbert space that are necessary to keep
the theory unitary. The exact cancellation taking place in Minkowski space due
to this auxiliary condition is slightly violated when the system is upgraded to
an expanding background. Nevertheless, this ""tiny"" effect is in fact the
driving force accelerating the universe today. We also derive the time
dependent equation of state $w(t)$ for the dark energy component which tracks
the dynamics of the Veneziano ghost in a FLRW universe. Finally, we comment on
how the same physical phenomena can be recovered in Witten's approach to the
U(1) problem when the ghost degree of freedom is not even present in the

used genotype-based tests for case-control genetic analysis, one is a
Cochran-Armitage trend test (CAT test at $x=0.5$, or CAT0.5) and another
(called MAX2) is the maximization of two chi-square test results: one from the
two-by-two genotype count table that combines the baseline homozygotes and
heterozygotes, and another from the table that combines heterozygotes with risk
homozygotes. CAT0.5 is more suitable for multiplicative disease models and MAX2
is better for dominant/recessive models.
  Methods: We define the CAT0.5-MAX2 phase diagram on the disease model space
such that regions where MAX2 is more powerful than CAT0.5 are separated from
regions where the CAT0.5 is more powerful, and the task is to choose the
appropriate parameterization to make the separation possible.
  Results: We find that using the difference of allele frequencies ($\delta_p$)
and the difference of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium coefficients
($\delta_\epsilon$) can separate the two phases well, and the phase boundaries
are determined by the angle $tan^{-1}(\delta_p/\delta_\epsilon)$, which is an
improvement over the disease model selection using $\delta_\epsilon$ only.
  Conclusions: We argue that phase diagrams similar to the one for CAT0.5-MAX2
have graphical appeals in understanding power performance of various tests,
clarifying simulation schemes, summarizing case-control datasets, and guessing
the possible mode of inheritance.

core-collapse supernovae to SNIa samples. We generate 1000 SNIa mock flux data
for each of the LSST filters based on existing design parameters, then use a
Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis to fit for the redshift, apparent
magnitude, stretch factor and the phase of the SNIa. We find that the model
fitting works adequately well when the true SNe redshift is below 0.5, while at
$z < 0.2$ the accuracy of the photometric data is almost comparable with
spectroscopic measurements of the same sample. We discuss the contamination of
Type Ib/c (SNIb/c) and Type II supernova (SNII) on the SNIa data set. We find
it is easy to distinguish the SNII through the large $\chi^2$ mismatch when
fitting to photometric data with Ia light curves. This is not the case for
SNIb/c. We implement a statistical method based on the Bayesian estimation in
order to statistically reduce the contamination from SNIb/c for cosmological
parameter measurements from the whole SNe sample. The proposed statistical
method also evaluate the fraction of the SNIa in the total SNe data set, which
provides a valuable guide to establish the degree of contamination.

wavelength of the resulting pattern; MD and continuum simulations both yield
wavelengths in accord with previous experimental results. The value of the
critical acceleration for ordered standing waves is approximately 10% higher in
molecular dynamics simulations than in the continuum simulations, and the
amplitude of the waves differs significantly between the models. The delay in
the onset of order in molecular dynamics simulations and the amplitude of noise
below this onset are consistent with the presence of fluctuations which are
absent in the continuum theory. The strength of the noise obtained by fit to
Swift-Hohenberg theory is orders of magnitude larger than the thermal noise in
fluid convection experiments, and is comparable to the noise found in
experiments with oscillated granular layers and in recent fluid experiments on
fluids near the critical point. Good agreement is found between the mean field
value of onset from the Swift-Hohenberg fit and the onset in continuum
simulations. Patterns are compared in cells oscillated at two different

expectation values. Possible effects of these fluctuations on the reheating
process after inflation are discussed. After determining the correlation length
of the fluctuations in two different models, corresponding to the decay in the
parametric resonance regime and in the perturbation theory, it is found that
these fluctuations should be taken into account in the final thermalization
process, in the back-reaction effects and when the formation of primordial
black holes is considered. In both models, by comparing quantum and thermal
fluctuations with each other it is observed that very quick thermalization
after the complete inflaton decay is not always possible even when the
interaction rates are large. On the other hand, when the back-reaction effects
are included during the preheating stage, the coherence of the inflaton
oscillations is shown to be lost because of the fluctuations in \chi^2.
Finally, we note that a large fluctuation in the energy density may cause a
black hole to form and we determine the fraction of total energy density that
goes into such primordial black holes in the model of preheating we consider.

the thickness of the viscous layer, the amplitude of the buffer layer, and the

research efforts: macroscopic properties, such as the frictional drag
experienced by a flow past a wall, and the turbulent spectrum. The turbulent
spectrum may be said to represent the fabric of a turbulent state; in practice
it is a power law of exponent \alpha (the ""spectral exponent"") that gives the
revolving velocity of a turbulent fluctuation (or ""eddy"") of size s as a
function of s. The link, if any, between macroscopic properties and the
turbulent spectrum remains missing. Might it be found by contrasting the
frictional drag in flows with differing types of spectra? Here we perform
unprecedented measurements of the frictional drag in soap-film flows, where the
spectral exponent \alpha = 3 and compare the results with the frictional drag
in pipe flows, where the spectral exponent \alpha = 5/3. For moderate values of
the Reynolds number Re (a measure of the strength of the turbulence), we find
that in soap-film flows the frictional drag scales as Re^{-1/2}, whereas in
pipe flows the frictional drag scales as Re^{-1/4} . Each of these scalings may
be predicted from the attendant value of \alpha by using a new theory, in which
the frictional drag is explicitly linked to the turbulent spectrum. Our work
indicates that in turbulence, as in continuous phase transitions, macroscopic
properties are governed by the spectral structure of the fluctuations.

rooted trees such that ancestry queries between any two nodes in a tree can be
answered merely by looking at their corresponding labels. The quality of an
ancestry labeling scheme is measured by its label size, that is the maximal
number of bits in a label of a tree node.
  In addition to its theoretical appeal, the design of efficient ancestry
labeling schemes is motivated by applications in web search engines. For this
purpose, even small improvements in the label size are important. In fact, the
literature about this topic is interested in the exact label size rather than
just its order of magnitude. As a result, following the proposal of a simple
interval-based ancestry scheme with label size $2\log_2 n$ bits (Kannan et al.,
STOC '88), a considerable amount of work was devoted to improve the bound on
the size of a label. The current state of the art upper bound is $\log_2 n +
O(\sqrt{\log n})$ bits (Abiteboul et al., SODA '02) which is still far from the
known $\log_2 n + \Omega(\log\log n)$ bits lower bound (Alstrup et al., SODA
'03).
  In this paper we close the gap between the known lower and upper bounds, by
constructing an ancestry labeling scheme with label size $\log_2 n + O(\log\log
n)$ bits. In addition to the optimal label size, our scheme assigns the labels
in linear time and can support any ancestry query in constant time.

result if these are supposed to be the most relaxed systems, and has
implications in the relaxation time scales of HI disks and the nature of the
most frequent perturbing mechanisms in galaxies. Our sample likely exhibits the
lowest HI asymmetry level in the local Universe. We found that other field
samples present an excess of ~ 20% more asymmetric HI profiles than that in
CIG. Still a small percentage of galaxies in our sample present large
asymmetries. Follow-up high resolution VLA maps give insight into the origin of
such asymmetries.

assumed to be roughly 0.5 Msun. As a consequence, WDs of lower masses are
usually identified as He-core remnants. However, when the initial mass of the
progenitor star is in between 1.8 and 3 Msun, which corresponds to the so
called red giant (RGB) phase transition, the mass of the H-exhausted core at
the tip of the RGB is 0.3 < M_H/Msun < 0.5. Prompted by this well known result
of stellar evolution theory, we investigate the possibility to form C-O WDs
with mass M < 0.5 Msun. The pre-WD evolution of stars with initial mass of
about 2.3 Msun, undergoing anomalous mass-loss episodes during the RGB phase
and leading to the formation of WDs with He-rich or CO-rich cores have been
computed. The cooling sequences of the resulting WDs are also described. We
show that the minimum mass for a C-O WD is about 0.33 Msun, so that both He and
C-O core WDs can exist in the mass range 0.33-0.5 Msun. The models computed for
the present paper provide the theoretical tools to indentify the observational
counterpart of very low mass remnants with a C-O core among those commonly
ascribed to the He-core WD population in the progressively growing sample of
observed WDs of low mass. Moreover, we show that the central He-burning phase
of the stripped progeny of the 2.3 Msun star lasts longer and longer as the
total mass decreases. In particular, the M= 0.33 Msun model takes about 800 Myr
to exhausts its central helium, which is more than three time longer than the
value of the standard 2.3 Msun star: it is, by far, the longest core-He burning
lifetime. Finally, we find the occurrence of gravonuclear instabilities during
the He-burning shell phase.

smaller) than those of other cavities, then there is a photon bound state above
(or below) the energy band of the coupled cavity array. However, if two
cavities in the array have tunable frequencies, then there exist both bound
states and resonant states. When the frequencies of the two cavities are chosen
to be much larger than those of other cavities and the hopping couplings
between any two nearest-neighbor cavities are weak, a single photon with a
resonant wave vector can be trapped in the region between the two
frequency-tunable cavities. In this case, a quantum supercavity can be formed
by these two frequency-tunable cavities. We also study how to apply this photon
transport control to an array of coupled superconducting transmission line
resonators.

processing abilities of individuals often saturate. People, therefore, have to
select which elements of their environment they are focusing on, and which are
ignored. Moreover, recent work shows that individuals are naturally attracted
by what other people are interested in. This imitative behaviour gives rise to
various herding phenomena, such as the spread of ideas or the outbreak of
commercial trends, turning the understanding of collective attention an
important issue of our society. In this article, we propose an individual-based
model of collective attention. In a situation where a group of people is facing
a steady flow of novel information, the model naturally reproduces the
log-normal distribution of the attention each news item receives, in agreement
with empirical observations. Furthermore, the model predicts that the
popularity of a news item strongly depends on the number of concurrent news
appearing at approximately the same moment. We confirmed this prediction by
means of empirical data extracted from the website digg.com. This result can be
interpreted from the point of view of competition between the news for the
limited attention capacity of individuals. The proposed model, therefore,
provides new elements to better understand the dynamics of collective attention
in an information-rich world.

complete set of orthonormal functions on the 3-sphere is spanned by the Wigner

invariant under deck transformations and with domain the manifold. We prove

tool to study with accuracy nearby galaxies kinematics. Recent observations
also gives a new 2D vision of high redshift galaxies kinematics. This work
mostly relies on the kinematical sample of galaxies GHASP. This control sample,
composed of 203 local spiral and irregular galaxies in low density environments
observed with Fabry-Perot techniques in the Ha line (6563 A), is by now the
largest sample of Fabry-Perot data. After a revue on Fabry-Perot interferometry
and a presentation of new data reduction procedures, my implications on both
3D-NTT Fabry-Perot instrument and the wide field spectrograph project (WFSpec)
for galaxy evolution study with the european ELT are developed. The second
section is dedicated to GHASP data. This sample have been fully reduced and
analysed using new methods. The kinematical analysis of 2D kinematical maps has
been undertaken with the study of the dark matter distribution, the rotation
curves shape, bar signatures and the ionized gas velocity dispersion. In a
third section, this local reference sample is used as a zero point for high
redshift galaxies kinematical studies. The GHASP sample is projected at high
redshift (z=1.7) in order to disentangle evolution effects from distance biases
in high redshift galaxies kinematical data observed with SINFONI, OSIRIS and
GIRAFFE. The kinematical analysis of new SINFONI high redshift observations is
also presented and high redshift data found in the literature are compared with
GHASP projected sample, suggesting some evolution of the galaxy dynamical

This scenario is motivated by
the observational indications that the equation of state of dark energy across

still far from being conclusive. As a theoretical setup we introduce a no-go
theorem existing in quintom cosmology, and based on it we discuss the
conditions for the equation of state of dark energy realizing the quintom
scenario. The simplest quintom model can be achieved by introducing two scalar
fields with one being quintessence and the other phantom. Based on the
double-field quintom model we perform a detailed analysis of dark energy
perturbations and we discuss their effects on current observations. This type
of scenarios usually suffer from a manifest problem due to the existence of a
ghost degree of freedom, and thus we review various alternative realizations of
the quintom paradigm. The developments in particle physics and string theory
provide potential clues indicating that a quintom scenario may be obtained from
scalar systems with higher derivative terms, as well as from non-scalar
systems. Additionally, we construct a quintom realization in the framework of
braneworld cosmology, where the cosmic acceleration and the phantom divide
crossing result from the combined effects of the field evolution on the brane
and the competition between four and five dimensional gravity. Finally, we
study the outsets and fates of a universe in quintom cosmology. In a scenario
with null energy condition violation one may obtain a bouncing solution at
early times and therefore avoid the Big Bang singularity. Furthermore, if this
occurs periodically, we obtain a realization of an oscillating universe.
Lastly, we comment on several open issues in quintom cosmology and their
connection to future investigations.

which a noiseless unidirectional link connects one encoder to the other. Having
a constant capacity, the additional link provides partial cooperation between
the encoders. It is shown that the available cooperation can dramatically
increase the sum-capacity of the channel. This fact is proved based on
comparison of proposed lower and upper bounds on the sum-capacity. Partitioning
the data into three independent messages, namely private, common, and
cooperative ones, the transmission strategy used to obtain the lower bound
enjoys a simple type of Han-Kobayashi scheme together with a cooperative
communication scheme. A Genie-aided upper bound is developed which incorporates
the capacity of the cooperative link. Other upper bounds are based on the
sum-capacity of the Cognitive Radio Channel and cut-set bounds. For the strong
interference regime, the achievablity scheme is simplified to employ common
and/or cooperative messages but not the private one. Through a careful analysis
it is shown that the gap between these bounds is at most one and two bits per
real dimension for strong and weak interference regimes, respectively.
Moreover, the Generalized Degrees-of-Freedom of the channel is characterized.

deconvolution using a Bernoulli-Gaussian model. To tackle such a deconvolution
problem in a blind and unsupervised context, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) framework is usually adopted, and the chosen sampling scheme is most
often the Gibbs sampler. However, such a sampling scheme fails to explore the
state space efficiently. Our first alternative, the $K$-tuple Gibbs sampler, is
simply a grouped Gibbs sampler. The second one, called partially marginalized
sampler, is obtained by integrating the Gaussian amplitudes out of the target
distribution. While the mathematical validity of the first scheme is obvious as
a particular instance of the Gibbs sampler, a more detailed analysis is
provided to prove the validity of the second scheme.
  For both methods, optimized implementations are proposed in terms of
computation and storage cost. Finally, simulation results validate both schemes
as more efficient in terms of convergence time compared with the plain Gibbs
sampler. Benchmark sequence simulations show that the partially marginalized
sampler takes fewer iterations to converge than the $K$-tuple Gibbs sampler.
However, its computation load per iteration grows almost quadratically with
respect to the data length, while it only grows linearly for the $K$-tuple
Gibbs sampler.

from the Crab (which is among the 20 sources studied here) and an empty
location in a crowded field to derive an estimation of the systematic errors.

them on the Crab spectrum. Our SPI flux measurements also agree well with those
by Bouchet et al. (2008). All 20 sources in our sample are detected

eight sources, at 600-1000 keV we detect two sources. Our spectra agree well

dominant above the cutoff energy of the thermal Comptonization component. In
two of these cases, our study provides the first indication of such emission.

are extremely scarce and are - according to hierarchical structure formation -
only forming now (z < 1). The forthcoming deep HI SKA Pathfinders surveys will
uncover many more of them. This will lead to a better understanding of their
evolution and frequency, and the shape of the bright end of the HI mass
function.
  The recently discovered galaxy HIZOA J0836-43 is one of the most HI-rich
galaxies (M(HI)=7.5 x 10^10Msun - and the nearest of its kind. As such it is an
ideal local probe of these elusive galaxies. Results from a detailed
investigation in the near- (IRSF) and far-infrared (Spitzer) of this local
HI-massive galaxy are presented. Unlike other giant HI galaxies, it is not of
low surface brightness. The galaxy is found to be a luminous starbursting
galaxy at an unexpected early stage of stellar mass building, more typical of
star-forming galaxies at higher redshift (z~0.7). With regard to its
environment, hence possible clues to its formation, the near infrared imaging
survey finds HIZOAJ0836-43 to lie in a region underdense in L* galaxies -
consistent with the observation that HI-massive galaxies are preferentially
found in low density regions - in the presence, however, of an uncommonly large
number of low stellar mass galaxies.

needles is studied using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, multiple
histogram reweighting, and finite size scaling. The transition is shown to be
of the Kosterlitz-Thouless type, via a direct measurement of the critical
exponents eta and beta, of the susceptibility and order parameter,
respectively. At the transition, eta=1/4 and beta=1/8 are observed, in
excellent agreement with Kosterlitz-Thouless theory. Also the shift in the
chemical potential of the nematic susceptibility maximum with system size is in
good agreement with theoretical expectations. Some evidence of singular
behavior in the density fluctuations is observed, but no divergence, consistent
with a negative specific heat critical exponent. At the transition, a scaling
analysis assuming a conventional critical point also gives reasonable results.
However, the apparent critical exponent beta_eff obtained in this case is not
consistent with theoretical predictions.

the Universe can stay at the stable state past eternally and may undergo a
series of infinite, nonsingular oscillations. Once the parameter of the

coincides with the unstable one, and the Universe enters an inflationary era.

a paradigmatic model in Loop Quantum Cosmology. In spite of the prominent role
that the model has played in the development of this branch of physics, there
still remain some aspects of its quantization which deserve a more detailed
discussion. These aspects include the kinematical resolution of the
cosmological singularity, the precise relation between the solutions of the
densitized and non-densitized versions of the quantum Hamiltonian constraint,
the possibility of identifying superselection sectors which are as simple as
possible, and a clear comprehension of the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) limit
associated with the theory in those sectors. We propose an alternative operator
to represent the Hamiltonian constraint which is specially suitable to deal
with these issues in a satisfactory way. In particular, with our constraint
operator, the singularity decouples in the kinematical Hilbert space and can be
removed already at this level. Thanks to this fact, we can densitize the
quantum Hamiltonian constraint in a rigorous manner. Besides, together with the
physical observables, this constraint superselects simple sectors for the
universe volume, with a support contained in a single semiaxis of the real line
and for which the basic functions that encode the information about the
geometry possess optimal physical properties. Namely, they provide a
no-boundary description around the cosmological singularity and admit a
well-defined WDW limit in terms of standing waves. Both properties explain the
presence of a generic quantum bounce replacing the singularity at a fundamental
level, in contrast with previous studies where the bounce was proved in
concrete regimes and focusing on states with a marked semiclassical behavior.

highsensitivity gamma-ray and cosmic-ray detector that builds on the experience
and technology of the Milagro observatory. Like Milagro, HAWC utilizes the
water Cherenkov technique to measure extensive air showers. Instead of a pond
filled with water (as in Milagro) an array of closely packed water tanks is
used. The event direction will be reconstructed using the times when the PMTs
in each tank are triggered. Therefore, the timing calibration will be crucial
for reaching an angular resolution as low as 0.25 degrees.We propose to use a
laser calibration system, patterned after the calibration system in Milagro.
Like Milagro, the HAWC optical calibration system will use ~1 ns laser light
pulses. Unlike Milagro, the PMTs are optically isolated and require their own
optical fiber calibration. For HAWC the laser light pulses will be directed
through a series of optical fan-outs and fibers to illuminate the PMTs in
approximately one half of the tanks on any given pulse. Time slewing
corrections will be made using neutraldensity filters to control the light
intensity over 4 orders of magnitude. This system is envisioned to run
continuously at a low rate and will be controlled remotely. In this paper, we
present the design of the calibration system and first measurements of its
performance.

  atmospheres","Paper presented at IAU General Assembly Joint Discussion 10 ""3D views
  on cool stellar atmospheres: theory meets observation""; reference added",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theoretical prediction of micro- and macroturbulence (xi_mic and xi_mac)
as a function of stellar parameters can be useful for spectroscopic work based
on 1D model atmospheres in cases where an empirical determination of xi_mic is
impossible due to a lack of suitable lines and/or macroturbulence and
rotational line broadening are difficult to separate. In an effort to exploit
the CIFIST 3D model atmosphere grid for deriving the theoretical dependence of
xi_mic and xi_mac on effective temperature, gravity, and metallicity, we
discuss different methods to derive xi_mic from the numerical simulations, and
report first results for the Sun and Procyon. In both cases the preliminary
analysis indicates that the microturbulence found in the simulations is
significantly lower than in the real stellar atmospheres.

like when they emerged on the primitive earth, and what simple catalytic
activities they fulfilled. We conjecture that the early functional peptides
were short (3 to 8 amino acids long), were made of those amino acids, Gly, Ala,
Val and Asp, that are abundantly produced in many prebiotic synthesis
experiments and observed in meteorites, and that the neutralization of Asp's
negative charge is achieved by metal ions. We further assume that some traces
of these prebiotic peptides still exist, in the form of active sites in
present-day proteins. Searching these proteins for prebiotic peptide candidates
led us to identify three main classes of motifs, bound mainly to Mg^{2+} ions:
D(F/Y)DGD corresponding to the active site in RNA polymerases, DGD(G/A)D
present in some kinds of mutases, and DAKVGDGD in dihydroxyacetone kinase. All
three motifs contain a DGD submotif, which is suggested to be the common
ancestor of all active peptides. Moreover, all three manipulate phosphate
groups, which was probably a very important biological function in the very
first stages of life. The statistical significance of our results is supported
by the frequency of these motifs in today's proteins, which is three times
higher than expected by chance, with a P-value of 3 10^{-2}. The implications
of our findings in the context of the appearance of life and the possibility of
an experimental validation are discussed.
