last decade. We are now exploring redshifts of 6 and beyond, when the Universe
was less than a billion years old, an epoch when the previously-neutral
intergalactic medium was reionized. The continuing discovery of galaxies at
progressively higher and higher redshifts has been driven by the availability
of large telescopes on the ground and in space, improvements in detector
technology, and new search strategies. Over the past 4 years, the Lyman break
technique has been shown to be effective in isolating z~6 star-forming i'-drop
galaxies through spectroscopic confirmation with large ground-based telescopes
(Keck, Gemini and the ESO VLTs). Narrow-band imaging, notably with the wide
field of the Subaru telescope, has also produced samples of Lyman-alpha
emitters at these redshifts. A The discovery of this i'-drop galaxy population
has been used to infer the global star formation rate density at this epoch
(z~6), and we are now beginning to constrain the contribution to reionization
of the UV flux from these galaxies. Infrared data from the Spitzer Space
Telescope has been used to determine the spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
from the rest-frame UV to the optical, and constrain the previous star
formation histories, masses and ages. The indications are that much of the
stellar mass of these galaxies might have formed in vigorous bursts at z>6. The
next big advances would be to test the population synthesis modelling of these
z~6 galaxies through spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical (rather than crude
broad-band SEDs), and also to push the observational horizon for galaxies
further to directly explore star formation during the reionization epoch. JWST
is likely to have a profound impact on realising these goals.

Nachr",,"10.1002/asna.200911254",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we make an effort to understand the interaction of turbulence
generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) with turbulence from other
sources, such as supernova explosions (SNe) in galactic disks. First we perform
a linear stability analysis (LSA) of non-ideal MRI to derive the limiting value
of Ohmic diffusion that is needed to inhibit the growth of the instability for
different types of rotation laws. With the help of a simple analytical
expression derived under first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA), an
estimate of the limiting turbulence level and hence the turbulent diffusion
needed to damp the MRI is derived. Secondly, we perform numerical simulations
in local cubes of isothermal nonstratified gas with external forcing of varying
strength to see whether the linear result holds for more complex systems.
Purely hydrodynamic calculations with forcing, rotation and shear are made for
reference purposes, and as expected, non-zero Reynolds stresses are found. In
the magnetohydrodynamic calculations, therefore, the total stresses generated
are a sum of the forcing and MRI contributions. To separate these
contributions, we perform reference runs with MRI-stable shear profiles
(angular velocity increasing outwards), which suggest that the MRI-generated
stresses indeed become strongly suppressed as function of the forcing. The
Maxwell to Reynolds stress ratio is observed to decrease by an order of
magnitude as the turbulence level due to external forcing exceeds the predicted
limiting value, which we interpret as a sign of MRI suppression. Finally, we
apply these results to estimate the limiting radius inside of which the SN
activity can suppress the MRI, arriving at a value of 14 kpc.

mechanism for discs, resulting in their flared geometric structure. In a series
of papers, we investigate the deep links between 2D self-consistent disc
structure and planetary migration in irradiated discs, focusing particularly on
those around M stars. In this first paper, we analyse the thermal structure of
discs that are irradiated by an M star by solving the radiative transfer
equation by means of a Monte Carlo code. Our simulations of irradiated
hydrostatic discs are realistic and self-consistent in that they include dust
settling with multiple grain sizes (N=15), the gravitational force of an
embedded planet on the disc, and the presence of a dead zone (a region with
very low levels of turbulence) within it. We show that dust settling drives the
temperature of the mid-plane from an $r^{-3/5}$ distribution (well mixed dust
models) toward an $r^{-3/4}$. The dead zone, meanwhile, leaves a dusty wall at
its outer edge because dust settling in this region is enhanced compared to the
active turbulent disc at larger disc radii. The disc heating produced by this
irradiated wall provides a positive gradient region of the temperature in the
dead zone in front of the wall. This is crucially important for slowing
planetary migration because Lindblad torques are inversely proportional to the
disc temperature. Furthermore, we show that low turbulence of the dead zone is
self-consistently induced by dust settling, resulting in the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHI). We show that the strength of turbulence arising from the KHI
in the dead zone is $\alpha=10^{-5}$.

which $G_n/K_n$ is a commutative nilmanifold. In each we worked out a method
inspired by the Frobenius--Schur Orthogonality Relations to define isometric

This left open questions concerning the nature of the elements of $L^2(G/K)$.
Here we define spaces $\cA(G_n/K_n)$ of regular functions on $G_n/K_n$ and

$G$--submodule of the much larger inverse limit $\varprojlim \{\cA(G_n/K_n),

$\cA(G/K)$ derived from that of $L^2(G/K)$. This allows an interpretation of
$L^2(G/K)$ as the Hilbert space completion of the concretely defined function

that a weak curvature singularity with $|R|\to\infty$ can arise generically in
viable $F(R)$ models of present dark energy (DE) signaling an internal
incompleteness of these models. In this work we study how this problem is cured
by adding a quadratic correction with a sufficiently small coefficient to the
$F(R)$ function at large curvatures. At the same time, this correction
eliminates two more serious problems of previously constructed viable $F(R)$ DE
models: unboundedness of the mass of a scalar particle (scalaron) arising in
$F(R)$ gravity and the scalaron overabundance problem. Such carefully
constructed models can also yield both an early time inflationary epoch and a
late time de Sitter phase with vastly different values of $R$. The reheating
epoch in these combined models of primordial and present dark energy is
completely different from that of the old $R + R^{2}/6M^{2}$ inflationary
model, mainly due to the fact that values of the effective gravitational
constant at low and intermediate curvatures are different for positive and
negative $R$. This changes the number of e-folds during the observable part of

K-theory. Hence, by the work of Ausoni and the fourth author, virtual 2-vector

as elliptic cohomology. The main technical step is showing that for
well-behaved small rig categories R (also known as bimonoidal categories) the
algebraic K-theory space, K(HR), of the ring spectrum HR associated to R is
equivalent to Z \times |BGL(R)|^+, where GL(R) is the monoidal category of
weakly invertible matrices over R. If \pi_0R is a ring this is almost formal,
and our approach is to replace R by a ring completed version provided by
[BDRR1] whose \pi_0 is the ring completion of \pi_0R.

rotate rapidly due to their radiative exteriors. This rapid rotation leads to
an oblate stellar figure. It also induces the photosphere to be hotter (by up
to several thousand Kelvin) at the pole than at the equator as a result of a
process called gravity darkening that was first predicted by von Zeipel (1924).
Transits of extrasolar planets across such a non-uniform, oblate disk yield
unusual and distinctive lightcurves that can be used to determine the relative
alignment of the stellar rotation pole and the planet orbit normal. This
spin-orbit alignment can be used to constrain models of planet formation and
evolution. Orderly planet formation and migration within a disk that is
coplanar with the stellar equator will result in spin-orbit alignment. More
violent planet-planet scattering events should yield spin-orbit misaligned
planets. Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements of transits of lower-mass stars show
that some planets are spin-orbit aligned, and some are not. Since
Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements are difficult around rapid rotators,
lightcurve photometry may be the best way to determine the spin-orbit alignment
of planets around massive stars. The Kepler mission will monitor ~10^4 of these
stars within its sample. The lightcurves of any detected planets will allow us
to probe the planet formation process around high-mass stars for the first
time.

investigation, since many users find structured queries too hard to express,
and enjoy the freedom of a ``Google-like'' query box into which search terms
can be entered. Attempts to address this problem face a fundamental dilemma.
Database querying is based on the logic of predicate evaluation, with a
precisely defined answer set for a given query. On the other hand, in an
information retrieval approach, ranked query results have long been accepted as
far superior to results based on boolean query evaluation. As a consequence,
when keyword queries are attempted against databases, relatively ad-hoc ranking
mechanisms are invented (if ranking is used at all), and there is little
leverage from the large body of IR literature regarding how to rank query
results.
  Our proposal is to create a clear separation between ranking and database
querying. This divides the problem into two parts, and allows us to address
these separately. The first task is to represent the database, conceptually, as
a collection of independent ``queried units'', or ``qunits'', each of which
represents the desired result for some query against the database. The second
task is to evaluate keyword queries against a collection of qunits, which can
be treated as independent documents for query purposes, thereby permitting the
use of standard IR techniques. We provide insights that encourage the use of
this query paradigm, and discuss preliminary investigations into the efficacy
of a qunits-based framework based on a prototype implementation.

the energy consumed during query processing. Both economical and environmental
factors now require that DBMSs pay close attention to energy consumption. In
this paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a
first-class performance goal for query processing in a DBMS. We present two
concrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy
consumption. Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance. The
first technique, called PVC, leverages the ability of modern processors to
execute at lower processor voltage and frequency. The second technique, called
QED, uses query aggregation to leverage common components of queries in a
workload. Using experiments run on a commercial DBMS and MySQL, we show that
PVC can reduce the processor energy consumption by 49% of the original
consumption while increasing the response time by only 3%. On MySQL, PVC can
reduce energy consumption by 20% with a response time penalty of only 6%. For
simple selection queries with no predicate overlap, we show that QED can be
used to gracefully trade response time for energy, reducing energy consumption
by 54% for a 43% increase in average response time. In this paper we also
highlight some research issues in the emerging area of energy-efficient data

Transactional Component (TC) works at a logical level only: it knows about
transactions and their ""logical"" concurrency control and undo/redo recovery,
but it does not know about page layout, B-trees etc. A Data Component (DC)
knows about the physical storage structure. It supports a record oriented

transactions. Providing atomic record operations may itself involve DC-local
concurrency control and recovery, which can be implemented using system
transactions. The interaction of the mechanisms in TC and DC leads to
multi-level redo (unlike the repeat history paradigm for redo in integrated
engines). This refactoring of the system architecture could allow easier
deployment of application-specific physical structures and may also be helpful
to exploit multi-core hardware. Particularly promising is its potential to
enable flexible transactions in cloud database deployments. We describe the

  In this paper, we argue that hardware-only approaches are only part of the
solution, and that data management software will be key in optimizing for
energy efficiency. We discuss the problems arising from growing energy use in
data centers and the trends that point to an increasing set of opportunities
for software-level optimizations. Using two simple experiments, we illustrate
the potential of such optimizations, and, motivated by these examples, we
discuss general approaches for reducing energy waste. Lastly, we point out
existing places within database systems that are promising for
energy-efficiency optimizations and urge the data management systems community
to shift focus from performance-oriented research to energy-efficient
computing.

several decades now. They have mainly focused on parsing and interpreting
natural language queries to generate them in a formal database language. We
envision the reverse functionality, where the system would be able to take the
internal result of that translation, say in SQL form, translate it back into
natural language, and show it to the initiator of the query for verification.
Likewise, information extraction has received considerable attention in the
past ten years or so, identifying structured information in free text so that
it may then be stored appropriately and queried. Validation of the records
stored with a backward translation into text would again be very powerful.
Verification and validation of query and data input of a database system
correspond to just one example of the many important applications that would
benefit greatly from having mature techniques for translating such database
constructs into free-flowing text. The problem appears to be deceivingly
simple, as there are no ambiguities or other complications in interpreting
internal database elements, so initially a straightforward translation appears
adequate. Reality teaches us quite the opposite, however, as the resulting text
should be expressive, i.e., accurate in capturing the underlying queries or
data, and effective, i.e., allowing fast and unique interpretation of them.
Achieving both of these qualities is very difficult and raises several
technical challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we first expose
the reader to several situations and applications that need translation into
natural language, thereby, motivating the problem. We then outline, by example,
the research problems that need to be solved, separately for data translations

carriers, which leads to such unusual phenomena as metallic conductivity in the
limit of no carriers and the half-integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) observable
even at room temperature [1-3]. Because graphene is only one atom thick, it is
also amenable to external influences including mechanical deformation. The
latter offers a tempting prospect of controlling graphene's properties by
strain and, recently, several reports have examined graphene under uniaxial
deformation [4-8]. Although the strain can induce additional Raman features
[7,8], no significant changes in graphene's band structure have been either
observed or expected for realistic strains of approx. 10% [9-11]. Here we show
that a designed strain aligned along three main crystallographic directions
induces strong gauge fields [12-14] that effectively act as a uniform magnetic
field exceeding 10 T. For a finite doping, the quantizing field results in an
insulating bulk and a pair of countercirculating edge states, similar to the
case of a topological insulator [15-20]. We suggest realistic ways of creating
this quantum state and observing the pseudo-magnetic QHE. We also show that
strained superlattices can be used to open significant energy gaps in

on, the reliable components were small such as mirrored disks or ECC (Error
Correcting Codes) in core memory. These systems were designed such that
failures of these small components were transparent to the application. Later,
the size of the unreliable components grew larger and semantic challenges crept
into the application when failures occurred.
  As the granularity of the unreliable component grows, the latency to
communicate with a backup becomes unpalatable. This leads to a more relaxed
model for fault tolerance. The primary system will acknowledge the work request
and its actions without waiting to ensure that the backup is notified of the
work. This improves the responsiveness of the system.
  There are two implications of asynchronous state capture: 1) Everything
promised by the primary is probabilistic. There is always a chance that an
untimely failure shortly after the promise results in a backup proceeding
without knowledge of the commitment. Hence, nothing is guaranteed! 2)
Applications must ensure eventual consistency. Since work may be stuck in the
primary after a failure and reappear later, the processing order for work
cannot be guaranteed.
  Platform designers are struggling to make this easier for their applications.
Emerging patterns of eventual consistency and probabilistic execution may soon
yield a way for applications to express requirements for a ""looser"" form of

it proves unnecessary to handle the logarithmic behavior near the

equal to the calculated global energy at all collocation points, local errors
go down everywhere with increasing resolution, the effective basis using

propose several models for taking the atomicity of a chunk into account. For
all these models, when considering the transmission of a single chunk,
heterogeneity is indeed a ``blessing'', in the sense that the achievable delay
is always faster than an equivalent homogeneous system. But for a stream of
chunks, we show that it can be a ``curse'': there is systems where the
achievable delay can be arbitrary greater compared to equivalent homogeneous
systems. However, if the system is slightly bandwidth-overprovisioned, optimal
single chunk diffusion schemes can be adapted to a stream of chunks, leading to
near-optimal, faster than homogeneous systems, heterogeneous live streaming
systems.

1300-1400cm -1, along with an existing GEISA list, we retrieve propane

continuum gradients due to haze and also an imperfect model of the n6 band of
ethane. This study clearly shows for the first time the ubiquity of propane's
emission bands across the thermal infrared spectrum of Titan, and points to an
urgent need for further laboratory spectroscopy work, both to provide the line

characterize haze spectral opacity. The present lack of accurate modeling

evolution as driven by gravitational wave emission and tidal interaction, and
determine their reaction to a sudden perturbation of the system. This is
inspired by the suggestion to explain the orbital period evolution of the
ultra-compact binary systems V407 Vul and RX-J0806+1527 by non-equilibrium mass
transfer. The characteristics of the emitted gravitational wave signal are
deduced from a Taylor expansion of a Newtonian quadrupolar emission model, and
the changes in signal structure as visible to the LISA mission are determined.
We show that short term variations can significantly change the higher order
terms in the expansion, and thus lead to spurious (non) detection of frequency
derivatives. This may hamper the estimation of the parameters of the system, in
particular their masses and distances. However, we find that overall detection
is still secured as signals still can be described by general templates. We
conclude that a better modelling of the effects of short term variations is

for the first gravitational lens, Q0957+561. With deep imaging we identify 24
new strongly lensed features, which we use to constrain mass models. We model
the stellar component of the lens galaxy using the observed luminosity
distribution, and the dark matter halo using several different density
profiles. We draw on the weak lensing analysis by Nakajima et al. (2009) to
constrain the mass sheet and environmental terms in the lens potential.
Adopting the well-measured time delay, we find H_0 = 85 (+14/-13) km/s/Mpc (68%
CL) using lensing constraints alone. The principal uncertainties in H_0 are
tied to the stellar mass-to-light ratio (a variant of the radial profile
degeneracy in lens models). Adding constraints from stellar population
synthesis models, we obtain H_0 = 79.3 (+6.7/-8.5) km/s/Mpc (68% CL). We infer
that the lens galaxy has a rising rotation curve and a dark matter distribution
with an inner core. Intriguingly, we find the quasar flux ratios predicted by
our models to be inconsistent with existing radio measurements, suggesting the
presence of substructure in the lens.

the bars in these galaxies. We base our results on a combination of this method
with a morphological analysis designed to estimate the corotation radius to
bar-length ratio using two independent techniques on archival near infrared

excellent agreement between bar and spiral arm parameters derived using

independently from photometry and consistent with previous studies. Our
corotation/bar-length ratios and pattern speed values are in good agreement
with general results from numerical simulations of bars. In systems with
identified secondary bars, we measure higher H-alpha velocity dispersion in the
circumnuclear regions, whereas in all the other galaxies, we detect flat
velocity dispersion profiles. The excellent agreement between the

source transmits two private signals, one for each relay, where dirty paper

both relays. The relays make efficient use of the common information to
introduce a proper amount of correlation in the transmission to the

four mid-infrared (MIR) photometric bands centred at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0
microns; the results of observations undertaken using the Spitzer Space

NGC 3242, as previously observed through narrow band imaging at visual
wavelengths, as well as evidence for a comparable halo and ring system in NGC
7354. This is the first time that a halo and rings have been observed in the
latter source.
  We have analysed the formation of halos as a result of radiatively
accelerated mass loss in the AGB progenitors. Although the models assume that
dust formation occurs in C-rich environments, we note that qualitatively
similar results would be expected for O-rich progenitors as well. The model
fall-offs in halo density are found to result in gradients in halo surface
brightness which are similar to those observed in the visible and MIR.

randomized gossip algorithm for distributed computation of the average
consensus problem. In gossip algorithms, nodes in the network randomly
communicate with their neighbors and exchange information iteratively. The
algorithms are simple and decentralized, making them attractive for wireless
network applications. In general, gossip algorithms are robust to unreliable
wireless conditions and time varying network topologies. In this paper we
introduce GGE and demonstrate that greedy updates lead to rapid convergence. We
do not require nodes to have any location information. Instead, greedy updates
are made possible by exploiting the broadcast nature of wireless
communications. During the operation of GGE, when a node decides to gossip,
instead of choosing one of its neighbors at random, it makes a greedy
selection, choosing the node which has the value most different from its own.
In order to make this selection, nodes need to know their neighbors' values.
Therefore, we assume that all transmissions are wireless broadcasts and nodes
keep track of their neighbors' values by eavesdropping on their communications.
We show that the convergence of GGE is guaranteed for connected network
topologies. We also study the rates of convergence and illustrate, through
theoretical bounds and numerical simulations, that GGE consistently outperforms
randomized gossip and performs comparably to geographic gossip on
moderate-sized random geometric graph topologies.

theory using simulations, we provide a quantitative analysis of the FECs for a

they are irradiated by ultraviolet and X-ray photons from a low-mass central
star. Our model is a hybrid of a 1D time-dependent viscous disk model coupled
to a 1+1D disk vertical structure model used for calculating the disk structure
and photoevaporation rates. We find that disks of initial mass 0.1M_o around
1M_o stars survive for 4x10^6 years, assuming a viscosity parameter
$\alpha=0.01$, a time-dependent FUV luminosity $L_{FUV}~10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ L_o
and with X-ray and EUV luminosities $L_X \sim L_{EUV} ~ 10^{-3}$L_o. We find
that FUV/X-ray-induced photoevaporation and viscous accretion are both
important in depleting disk mass. Photoevaporation rates are most significant
at ~ 1-10 AU and at >~ 30 AU. Viscosity spreads the disk which causes mass loss
by accretion onto the central star and feeds mass loss by photoevaporation in
the outer disk. We find that FUV photons can create gaps in the inner,
planet-forming regions of the disk (~ 1-10 AU) at relatively early epochs in
disk evolution while disk masses are still substantial. EUV and X-ray photons
are also capable of driving gaps, but EUV can only do so at late, low
accretion-rate epochs after the disk mass has already declined substantially.
Disks around stars with predominantly soft X-ray fields experience enhanced
photoevaporative mass loss. We follow disk evolution around stars of different
masses, and find that disk survival time is relatively independent of mass for
stars with M <~ 3M_o; for M >~ 3M_o the disks are short-lived(~10^5 years).

previous measurements of point source non-Gaussianity. We also consider an
analysis where we also account for the primordial non-Gaussianity in addition
to lensing-secondary bispectrum and point sources. The focus of this paper is
on secondary anisotropies. Consequently the estimator is not optimised for
primordial non-Gaussianity and the limit we find on local non-Gaussianity from

correct, then it would suggest that NGC 3242 is moving towards the NE; a
suggestion which is also supported through the presence of a 60 microns tail

This article proposes yet another one. This alternative is distinctly different
from the others because it considers mass generation through internal

requires particles to have an internal structure beyond intrinsic spin. A
complete field theory of such composite particles is seen to be possible. Of
course, if Higgs bosons are observed by experiment, there will be no need for

a highly debated topic. Recent Swift observations suggest that these GRBs may
be related to catastrophic explosions in degenerate compact stars, denoted as
""Type I"" GRBs. The most popular models include the merger of two compact
stellar objects (NS-NS or NS-BH). We utilize a Monte Carlo approach to
determine whether a merger progenitor model can self-consistently account for
all the observations of short-hard GRBs, including a sample with redshift
measurements in the Swift era (z-known sample) and the CGRO/BATSE sample. We
apply various merger time delay distributions invoked in compact star merger
models to derive the redshift distributions of these Type I GRBs, and then
constrain the unknown luminosity function of Type I GRBs using the observed
luminosity-redshift (L - z) distributions of the z-known sample. The best
luminosity function model, together with the adopted merger delay model, are
then applied to confront the peak flux distribution (log N - log P
distribution) of the BATSE and Swift samples. We find that for all the merger
models invoking a range of merger delay time scales (including those invoking a
large fraction of ""prompt mergers""), it is difficult to reconcile the models
with all the data. The data are instead statistically consistent with the
following two possible scenarios. First, that short/hard GRBs are a
superposition of compact-star-merger origin (Type I) GRBs and a population of
GRBs that track the star formation history, which are probably related to the
deaths of massive stars (Type II GRBs). Sec- ond, the entire short/hard GRB
population is consistent with a typical delay of 2 Gyr with respect to the star
formation history with modest scatter. This may point towards a different Type
I progenitor than the traditional compact star merger models.

mixed through several biological mechanisms, including incomplete lineage
sorting or horizontal gene transfer in the case of different topologies, or
simply different substitution processes on characters in the case of the same
topology. Recent work on a 2-state symmetric model of character change showed
such a mixture model has non-identifiable parameters, and thus it is
theoretically impossible to determine the two tree topologies from any amount
of data under such circumstances. Here the question of identifiability is
investigated for 2-tree mixtures of the 4-state group-based models, which are
more relevant to DNA sequence data. Using algebraic techniques, we show that
the tree parameters are identifiable for the JC and K2P models. We also prove
that generic substitution parameters for the JC mixture models are
identifiable, and for the K2P and K3P models obtain generic identifiability
results for mixtures on the same tree. This indicates that the full
phylogenetic signal remains in such mixtures, and that the 2-state symmetric
result is thus a misleading guide to the behavior of other models.

tradeoffs between key storage, average key path length (directly related to the
battery consumption) and resilience (to compromised nodes) of key
predistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks. Based on the proposed

``problem of time'' which, in its various forms, is the main obstacle to a

that space is real. I propose that what does not fundamentally exist is not

$Z=\sup_{t\in T}X_{t}$ by using the generic chaining device introduced in
Talagrand (2005). Compared to concentration-type inequalities, these bounds
offer the advantage to hold under weaker conditions on the family
$\pa{X_{t}}_{t\in T}$. The second part of the paper is oriented towards
statistics. We consider the regression setting $Y=f+\eps$ where $f$ is an
unknown vector of $\R^{n}$ and $\eps$ is a random vector the components of
which are independent, centered and admit finite Laplace transforms in a
neighborhood of 0. Our aim is to estimate $f$ from the observation of $Y$ by
mean of a model selection approach among a collection of linear subspaces of
$\R^{n}$. The selection procedure we propose is based on the minimization of a
penalized criterion the penalty of which is calibrated by using the deviation
bounds established in the first part of this paper. More precisely, we study
suprema of random variables of the form $X_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}t_{i}\eps_{i}$
when $t$ varies among the unit ball of a linear subspace of $\R^{n}$. We
finally show that our estimator satisfies some oracle-type inequality under

the discovery of two types of dynamic cool coronal structures, and characterize

Extreme UltraViolet Imager (EUVI) telescope on the Solar TErrestrial RElation
Observatory (STEREO) and the Ca II filtergrams from the Solar Optical Telescope
(SOT) instrument on HINODE, we study the evolution of an EUV arch and the
kinematics of cool coronal structures. The EUV 304 angstrom observations show
that a missile-like plasmoid moves along an arch-shaped trajectory, with an
average velocity of 31 km/s. About three hours later, a plasma arch forms along
the trajectory, subsequently the top part of the arch fades away and
disappears, meanwhile the plasma belonging to the two legs of the arch flows
downward to the arch feet. During the arch formation and disappearance, SOT Ca
II images explore dynamic cool coronal structures beneath the arch. By tracking
these structures, we classify them into two types. Type I is threadlike in
shape and flows downward with a greater average velocity of 72 km/s, finally it
combines a loop fibril at chromospheric altitude. Type II is
shape-transformable and sometimes rolling as it flows downward with a smaller
velocity of 37 km/s, then disappears insularly in the chromosphere. It is
suggested that the two types of structures are possibly controlled by different
magnetic configurations.

of weakly bound molecular bosons to the region of strongly bound atomic bosons.
Here the crossover can be controlled by attractive fermion interaction. One of
the present models is a case with attractive fermion interaction, where an
insulator-superfluid transition takes place. The transition is characterized as
the transition between a band insulator and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
superfluid state. Differing from the conventional BCS superfluid transition,
this transition shows unconventional properties. In contrast to the one
particle excitation gap scaled by the superfluid order parameter in the
conventional BCS transition, because of the multi-band effects, a large gap of
one-particle density of states is retained all through the transition although
the superfluid order grows continuously from zero. A reentrant transition with
lowering temperature is another unconventionality. The other model is the case
with coexisting attractive and repulsive interactions. Within a mean field
treatment, we find a new insulating state, an orbital ordered insulator. This
insulator is one candidate for the Mott insulator of molecular bosons and is
the first example that the orbital internal degrees of freedom of molecular
bosons appears explicitly. Besides the emergence of a new phase, a coexisting
phase also appears where superfluidity and an orbital order coexist just by
doping holes or particles. The insulating and superfluid particles show
differentiation in momentum space as in the high-Tc cuprate superconductors.

failure occurs in the spin glass phase where spurious minima show up, while in
the paramagnetic phase, albeit unfavored during the retrieval dynamics, the

planetesimal-driven migration of the giant planets. A basic assumption of this
work is that giant planet migration occurred after the completion of
terrestrial planet formation, such as in the models that link the former to the
origin of the Late Heavy Bombardment. The divergent migration of Jupiter and
Saturn causes the g5 eigenfrequency to cross resonances of the form g5=gk with
k ranging from 1 to 4. Consequently these secular resonances cause
large-amplitude responses in the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets. We
show that the resonances g5=g_4 and g5=g3 do not pose a problem if Jupiter and
Saturn have a fast approach and departure from their mutual 2:1 mean motion
resonance. On the other hand, the resonance crossings g5=g2 and g5=g1 are more
of a concern as they tend to yield a terrestrial system incompatible with the
current one. We offer two solutions to this problem. The first uses the fact
that a secular resonance crossing can also damp the amplitude of a Fourier mode
if the latter is large originally. A second scenario involves a 'jumping
Jupiter' in which encounters between an ice giant and Jupiter, without ejection
of the former, cause the latter to migrate away from Saturn much faster than if
migration is driven solely by encounters with planetesimals. In this case, the
g5=g2 and g5=g1 resonances can be jumped over, or occur very briefly.

non-uniform out-of-plane polarization even for linear intrinsic spin-orbit
interactions. Analyzing different geometries in [001] and [110]-grown quantum
wells, we find that although this out-of-plane polarization is typically
confined to within a few spin-orbit lengths from the channel edges, it is also
possible to generate spatially oscillating spin profiles which extend over the
whole channel. The latter is due to the excitation of a driven spin-helix mode
in the transverse direction of the channel. We show that while finite
frequencies suppress this mode, it can be amplified by a magnetic field tuned
to resonance with the frequency of the electric field. In this case, finite
size effects at equal strengths of Rashba- and Dresselhaus SOI lead to an
enhancement of the magnitude of this helix mode. We comment on the relation

completely symmetric. AH structures simultaneously generalize Weyl structures
and abstract the geometric structure determined on a non-degenerate co-oriented
hypersurface in flat affine space by its second fundamental form together with
either the projective structure induced by the affine normal or that induced by
the conormal Gauss map. There are proposed notions of Einstein equations for AH
structures which for Weyl structures specialize to the usual Einstein Weyl
equations and such that the AH structure induced on a non-degenerate
co-oriented affine hypersurface is Einstein if and only if the hypersurface is
an affine hypersphere. It is shown that a convex flat projective structure
admits a metric with which it generates an Einstein AH structure, and examples
are constructed on mean curvature zero Lagrangian submanifolds of certain

structures by properties of the scalar curvature is extended to this setting.
Known estimates on the growth of the cubic form of an affine hypersphere are
partly generalized. The Riemannian Einstein equations are reformulated in terms
of a given background metric as an algebraically constrained elliptic system

constructed examples of exact Riemannian signature Einstein AH structures with
self-conjugate curvature but which are not Weyl and are neither projectively

Depending then on the framework in which the linear statistical model is

data-driven model selection criterion is obtained either under general
assumptions, or under the mild assumption of model identifiability
respectively. The proposed approach was stimulated by the important recent
non-asymptotic model selection results due to Birg\'e and Massart mainly (Birge
and Massart 2007), and our results in this paper, like theirs, are
non-asymptotic and turn to be sharp.
  Our main contribution in this paper resides in the fact that these linear
estimators are not necessarily least-squares estimators but can be any linear
estimators. The proposed approach finds therefore potential applications in
countless fields of engineering and applied science (image science, signal
processing,applied statistics, coding, to name a few) in which one is
interested in recovering some unknown vector quantity of interest as the one,
for example, which achieves the best trade-off between a term of fidelity to
data, and a term of regularity or/and parsimony of the solution. The proposed
approach provides then such applications with an interesting model selection
framework that allows them to achieve such a goal.

on the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. We focus on the processes
of tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and grouping
before infall. The tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition between
the phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occurs
at the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape of
their mass function with redshift. Although the satellites often form groups,
they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. The
infall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiar
distribution of the Local Group satellites, but only if it occurred recently.
Mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an early
stage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 Gyr ago, when they are still outside the

coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in single-walled carbon nanotubes

positions at T=0 K, resulting from the interplay between quantum zero-point
motion and nonlinear interaction. The CTE in SWCNT of different sizes is
studied and analyzed in terms of the competition between various vibration
modes. As a result of this competition, the axial CTE is positive in the whole
temperature range, while the radial CTE is negative at low temperatures. In
graphene, the CTE is very sensitive to the substrate. Without substrate, CTE
has large negative region at low temperature and very small value at high
temperature limit, and the value of CTE at T=300 K is $-6\times 10^{-6}$
K$^{-1}$ which is very close to recent experimental result, $-7\times 10^{-6}$
K$^{-1}$ (Nat. Nanotechnol. \textbf{10}, 1038 (2009)). A very weak substrate
interaction (about 0.06% of the in-plane interaction) can largely reduce the
negative CTE region and greatly enhance the value of CTE. If the substrate
interaction is strong enough, the CTE will be positive in whole temperature

calcium-binding proteins set a sharp threshold for calcium oscillations. Even
with high concentrations of calcium-binding proteins, internal noise, which
shows up spontaneously in cells in the process of calcium wave formation, can
lead to self-oscillations. This produces oscillatory behaviors strikingly
similar to those observed in real cells. In addition, for given intracellular
concentrations of both calcium and calcium-binding proteins the regularity of
these oscillations changes and reaches a maximum as a function noise variance,
and the overall system dynamics displays stochastic coherence. We conclude that
calcium-binding proteins may have an important and active role in cellular
communication.

of 111$\pm$9 pc. The radius of the less massive secondary component is larger
than that of the zero-age main-sequnce star having the same mass. While the
radius of the primary component is in agreement with ZAMS the secondary
component appers to be larger by about 35 % with respect to its ZAMS
counterpart. Night-to-night intrinsic light variations up to 0$^m$.2 have been
observed. In addition, the H$_{\alpha}$, H$_{\beta}$ lines and the forbidden

is seen in most of the spectra. These features are taken to be the signs of the

consistent with an age of about 20 Myr according to the stellar evolutionary
models. The spectroscopic and photometric results are in agreement with those

for an incoherent synchrotron radio source, commonly referred to in the

Compton effects. We show that a somewhat tighter limit T_{eq} ~ 10^{11} is
actually obtained for the condition of equipartition of energy between
radiating particles and magnetic fields which happens to be a configuration of
minimum energy for a self-absorbed synchrotron radio source. An order of
magnitude change in brightness temperature from T_{eq} in either direction
would require departures from equipartition of about eight orders of magnitude,
implying a change in total energy of the system up to ~ 10^{4} times the
equipartition value. Constraints of such extreme energy variations imply that
brightness temperatures may not depart much from T_{eq}. This is supported by
the fact that at the spectral turnover, brightness temperatures much lower than
~ 10^{11} K are also not seen in VLBI observations. Higher brightness
temperatures in particular, would require in the source not only many orders of
magnitude higher additional energy for the relativistic particles but also many
order of magnitude weaker magnetic fields. Diamagnetic effects do not allow
such extreme conditions, keeping the brightness temperatures close to the
equipartition value, which is well below the limit where inverse Compton
effects become important.

classifiers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data,
and it is particularly so for margin classifiers: there have been recent
contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model
selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of
linear classifiers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical
situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the
traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for
such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and
practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the first - to the best of our
knowledge - Pac-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data
exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results
is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the
dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph
fractional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to find an
upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is
sufficient to get new Pac-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our
results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as Auc) and
classifiers trained on data distributed according to a stationary {\ss}-mixing
process. In the way, we show how our approach seemlessly allows us to deal with
U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a Pac-Bayes generalization bound
for classifiers learned on data from stationary $\varphi$-mixing distributions.

here that even repressilators possess quasi-stable, travelling-wave periodic

solutions underlie the sustained oscillations observed in even rings in the
stochastic regime, even if these circuits are expected to behave as switches.
The existence of such solutions can also be exploited for control purposes:
operation of the system around the quasi-stable orbit allows us to turn on and
off the oscillations reliably and on demand. We illustrate these ideas with a
simple protocol based on optical interference that can induce oscillations

  crossing-critical graphs with prescribed average degree and crossing number"",
  to appear in Journal of Graph Theory",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Siran constructed infinite families of k-crossing-critical graphs for every k
> 2 and Kochol constructed such families of simple graphs for every k > 1.
Richter and Thomassen argued that, for any given k > 0 and r > 5, there are
only finitely many simple k-crossing-critical graphs with minimum degree r.
Salazar observed that the same argument implies such a conclusion for simple
k-crossing-critical graphs of prescribed average degree r > 6. He established
the existence of infinite families of simple k-crossing-critical graphs with
any prescribed rational average degree r in [4, 6) for infinitely many k and
asked about their existence for r in (3, 4). The question was partially settled
by Pinontoan and Richter, who answered it positively for r in (3.5, 4).
  The present contribution uses two new constructions of crossing critical
simple graphs along with the one developed by Pinontoan and Richter to unify
these results and to answer Salazar's question by the following statement:
there exist infinite families of simple k-crossing-critical graphs with any
prescribed average degree r in (3, 6), for any k greater than some lower bound
N(r). Moreover, a universal lower bound N(I) on k applies for rational numbers
in any closed interval I contained in (3, 6).

galaxies of the zCOSMOS-bright survey and its group catalogue to study the
complex interplay between group environment and galaxy properties. The
classical indicator F_blue (fraction of blue galaxies) proved to be a simple
but powerful diagnostic tool. We studied its variation for different luminosity
and mass selected galaxy samples. Using rest-frame B-band selected samples, the
groups galaxy population exhibits significant blueing as redshift increases,
but maintains a lower F_blue with respect both to the global and the isolated
galaxy population. However moving to mass selected samples it becomes apparent
that such differences are largely due to the biased view imposed by the B-band
luminosity selection, being driven by the population of lower mass, bright blue
galaxies for which we miss the redder, equally low mass, counterparts. By
focusing the analysis on narrow mass bins such that mass segregation becomes
negligible we find that only for the lowest mass bin explored (logMass <= 10.6)
does a significant residual difference in color remain as a function of
environment, while this difference becomes negligible toward higher masses. Our
results indicate that red galaxies of logMass >= 10.8 are already in place at z
~ 1 and do not exhibit any strong environmental dependence, possibly
originating from so-called 'nature'/internal mechanisms. In contrast, for lower
galaxy masses and redshifts lower than z ~ 1, we observe the emergence in
groups of a population of 'nurture' red galaxies: slightly deviating from the
trend of the downsizing scenario followed by the global galaxy population, and
more so with cosmic time. These galaxies exhibit signatures of group-related
secular physical mechanisms directly influencing galaxy evolution.

determining the properties of ejected and bound stars as well as collision
products. Unlike previous studies, we follow binaries that remain bound for
several revolutions around the SMBH, finding that in the case of relatively
large periapses and highly inclined binaries the Kozai resonance can lead to
large periodic oscillations in the internal binary eccentricity and
inclination. Collisions and mergers of the binary elements are found to
increase significantly for multiple orbits around the SMBH, while HVSs are

quantity to study is their sharpness distribution. In particular we suggest
that for very small scales the two-point correlation function of the string
tangent vector varies linearly with the separation and not as a fractional
power, as proposed by Polchinski and Rocha [Phys. Rev. D 74, 083504 (2006)].
However, our results are consistent with theirs, because the range of scales to
which this linearity applies shrinks as evolution proceeds.

which undergo dynamically driven starbursts induced by stellar feedback. Here
we focus on the impact of the adopted ISM model, i.e. either a diffuse or a
clumpy ISM. We apply a one-zone model extended for active dynamical evolution.
  We found two major types of repetitive star bursts: one set (type A) of
quasi-periodic starbursts is related to the dynamical timescale of the galaxy.
In that case, the star formation follows the variations of the gas density
induced by decaying virial oscillations. The second set (type B) of starbursts
is characterized by long quiescence periods given by the sum of the dynamical
and the dissipative timescale: after a first burst, the inserted energy leads
to a substantial expansion of the system, by this stopping any significant star
formation activity. A next burst might occur, when the gas reaches high
densities again, i.e. after the gas recollapsed and the energy injected by
stellar feedback is dissipated.
  In case of a diffuse ISM model, type A bursts are the most common type due to
the high efficiency of radiative cooling (no type B bursts are found). Bursts
occur then mainly during an initial transitory phase. In case of a clumpy ISM
model (i.e. dissipation by inelastic cloud-cloud collisions), the dissipative
timescale is of the order of the dynamical time or longer. This allows for
both, type A and type B bursts.

cohomology groups appear as certain subspaces of harmonic forms. DeTurck and

decompose into orthogonal subspaces corresponding to cohomology coming from the
interior and boundary of the manifold. The principal angles between these
interior subspaces are all acute and are called Poincare duality angles. This
paper determines the Poincare duality angles of a collection of interesting
manifolds with boundary derived from complex projective spaces and from
Grassmannians, providing evidence that the Poincare duality angles measure, in
some sense, how ""close"" a manifold is to being closed.
  This paper also elucidates a connection between the Poincare duality angles
and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for differential forms, which generalizes
the classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann map arising in the problem of Electrical
Impedance Tomography. Specifically, the Poincare duality angles are essentially
the eigenvalues of a related operator, the Hilbert transform for differential
forms. This connection is then exploited to partially resolve a question of
Belishev and Sharafutdinov about whether the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map
determines the cup product structure on a manifold with boundary.

these new scenarios for a range of DM densities on the host halo, a range of
scattering cross sections of the DM particles considered, and for stellar
masses from 0.7 to 3 M_{\odot}. For the first time, we also computed the
evolution of young low-mass stars in their Hayashi track in the pre-main

gravitational collapse before reaching the main sequence, in agreement with
similar studies on first stars. Such stars remain indefinitely in an
equilibrium state with lower effective temperatures (|\Delta T_eff| > 10^3 K
for a star of one solar mass), the annihilation of captured DM particles in
their core being the only source of energy. In the case of lower DM densities,
these proto-stars continue their collapse and progress through the main
sequence burning hydrogen at a lower rate. A star of 1 M_{\odot} will spend a
time greater than the current age of the universe consuming all the hydrogen in
its core if it evolves in a halo with DM density \rho_{\chi}=10^9 GeV cm^-3. We
also show the strong dependence of the effective temperature and luminosity of

by merging the words Economics and Physics, this new interdisciplinary field

distributions), microstructure of financial markets (order book modelling),
econometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. In the first part of the
review, we discuss on the emergence of Econophysics. Then we present empirical
studies revealing statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the
presentation with the widely acknowledged stylized facts which describe the
returns of financial assets- fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation,
etc.- and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way
time is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties
observed on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this
review, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own
high-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of
correlations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are
presented. In the second part of the review, we deal with models in
Econophysics through the point of view of agent-based modelling. Amongst a
large number of multi-agent-based models, we have identified three
representative areas. First, using previous work originally presented in the
fields of behavioural finance and market microstructure theory, econophysicists
have developed agent-based models of order-driven markets that are extensively
presented here. Second, kinetic theory models designed to explain some
empirical facts on wealth distribution are reviewed. Third, we briefly
summarize game theory models by reviewing the now classic minority game and

abstract interpretation framework that follows closely the Lyapunov methods
used in proofs at the model level and describe the corresponding abstract
domains, which for linear systems consist of ellipsoidal constraints. These
ellipsoidal domains provide abstractions for the values of state variables and
must be combined with other domains that model the remaining variables in a
program. Thus, the problem of automatically assigning the right type of
abstract domain to each variable arises. We provide an algorithm that solves
this classification problem in many practical cases and suggest how it could be
generalized to more complicated cases. We then find a fixpoint by solving a
matrix equation, which in the linear case is just the discrete Lyapunov
equation. Contrary to most cases in software analysis, this fixpoint cannot be
reached by the usual iterative method of propagating constraints until
saturation and so numerical methods become essential. Finally, we illustrate
our methodology with several examples.

electric field, we find that the transverse force perpendicular to the applied

dispersion. Surprisingly, in contrast to the previous results, the transverse
force generated by the electric field does not depend on the spin current, but
in general, it is related to the second derivative of energy dispersion only.
Furthermore, we find that the transverse force does not vanish in the
Rashba-Dresselhaus system. Therefore, the non-vanishing transverse force acts
as a driving force and results in charge imbalance at the edges of the sample.
The estimated ratio of the Hall voltage to the longitudinal voltage is $\sim
10^{-3}$. The disorder effect is also considered in the study of the
Rashba-Dresselhaus system. We find that the transverse force vanishes in the
