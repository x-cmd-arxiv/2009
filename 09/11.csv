recombination, using a Y_{105}-dropout selection. The new 4.7 arcmin**2 WFC3/IR
observations reach to ~28.8 AB mag (5 sigma) in the Y_{105}J_{125}H_{160}
bands. These remarkable data reach ~1.5 AB mag deeper than the previous data
over the HUDF, and now are an excellent match to the HUDF optical ACS data. For
our search criteria, we use a two-color Lyman-Break selection technique to
identify z~8-8.5 Y_{105}-dropouts. We find 5 likely z~8-8.5 candidates. The
sources have H_{160}-band magnitudes of ~28.3 AB mag and very blue UV-continuum
slopes, with a median estimated beta of <~-2.5 (where f_{\lambda}\propto
\lambda^{\beta}). This suggests that z~8 galaxies are not only essentially dust
free but also may have very young ages or low metallicities. The observed
number of Y_{105}-dropout candidates is smaller than the 20+/-6 sources
expected assuming no evolution from z~6, but is consistent with the 5 expected
extrapolating the Bouwens et al. 2008 LF results to z~8. These results provide
evidence that the evolution in the LF seen from z~7 to z~3 continues to z~8.
The remarkable improvement in the sensitivity of WFC3/IR has enabled HST to
cross a threshold, revealing star-forming galaxies at z~8-9.

short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies. These observations allow us
to characterize the galactic and local environments of short GRBs as a powerful
constraint on the nature of their progenitors. Using the HST data for 10 short
GRB hosts we determine the host morphological properties, measure precise
physical and host-normalized offsets relative to the galaxy centers, and study
the locations of short GRBs relative to their host light distributions. We find
that most short GRB hosts have exponential disk profiles, characteristic of
late-type galaxies, but with a median size that is twice as large as that of
long GRB hosts, commensurate with their higher luminosities. The observed
distribution of projected physical offsets, supplemented by ground-based
measurements, has a median of ~5 kpc, about 5 times larger than for long GRBs,
and in good agreement with predicted offset distributions for NS-NS binary
mergers. For the short GRB population as a whole we find the following robust
constraints: (i) >25% have projected offsets of <10 kpc; and (ii) >5% have
projected offsets of >20 kpc. We find no clear systematic trends for the offset
distribution of short GRBs with and without extended soft emission. While the
physical offsets are larger than for long GRBs, the distribution of
host-normalized offsets is nearly identical due to the larger size of short GRB
hosts. Finally, unlike long GRBs, which are concentrated in the brightest
regions of their host galaxies, short GRBs appear to under-represent the light
distribution of their hosts; this is true even in comparison to core-collapse
and Type Ia supernovae. Based on these results, we conclude that short GRBs are
consistent with a progenitor population of NS-NS binaries.

luminosities. The WFC3/IR data confirms previous NICMOS detections indicating
that the dropout selection at z~7 is very reliable. Our data allow a first
determination of the faint end slope of the z~7 luminosity function, reaching
down to M_UV ~ -18, a full magnitude fainter than previous measurements. When
fixing phi*=1.4e-3/Mpc^3/mag to the value previously measured at z~6, we find a
best-fit value of alpha=-1.77+-0.20, with a characteristic luminosity of
M_*=-19.91+-0.09. This steep slope is similar to what is seen at z~2-6 and
indicates that low luminosity galaxies could potentially provide adequate flux
to reionize the universe. The remarkable depth and resolution of these new

in galaxies remain unclear. A key stage in evolution, however, appears to be
represented by post-starburst galaxies. To investigate their impact on galaxy
evolution, we initiated a multiwavelength study of galaxies with k+a spectral
features in the COSMOS field. We examine a mass-selected sample of k+a galaxies
at z=0.48-1.2 using the spectroscopic zCOSMOS sample. K+a galaxies occupy the
brightest tail of the luminosity distribution. They are as massive as quiescent
galaxies and populate the green valley in the colour versus luminosity (or
stellar mass) distribution. A small percentage (<8%) of these galaxies have
radio and/or X-ray counterparts (implying an upper limit to the SFR of
~8Msun/yr). Over the entire redshift range explored, the class of k+a galaxies
is morphologically a heterogeneous population with a similar incidence of
bulge-dominated and disky galaxies. This distribution does not vary with the
strength of the Hdelta absorption line but instead with stellar mass in a way
reminiscent of the well-known mass-morphology relation. Although k+a galaxies
are also found in underdense regions, they appear to reside typically in a
similarly rich environment as quiescent galaxies on a physical scale of
~2-8Mpc, and in groups they show a morphological early-to-late type ratio
similar to the quiescent galaxy class. With the current data set, we do not
find evidence of statistical significant evolution in either the number/mass
density of k+a galaxies at intermediate redshift with respect to the local
values, or the spectral properties. Those galaxies, which are affected by a
sudden quenching of their star-formation activity, may increase the stellar
mass of the red-sequence by up to a non-negligible level of ~10%.

constraint-preserving boundary conditions of the Sommerfeld type has been

These Sommerfeld conditions have been previously presented in a 4-dimensional
geometric form. Here we recast the associated boundary data as 3-dimensional
tensor fields intrinsic to the boundary. This provides a geometric presentation
of the boundary data analogous to the 3-dimensional presentation of Cauchy data
in terms of 3-metric and extrinsic curvature. In particular, diffeomorphisms of
the boundary data lead to vacuum spacetimes with isometric geometries. The
proof of well-posedness is valid for the harmonic formulation and its
generalizations. The Sommerfeld conditions can be directly applied to existing
harmonic codes which have been used in simulating binary black holes, thus
ensuring boundary stability of the underlying analytic system. The geometric
form of the boundary conditions also allows them to be formally applied to any
metric formulation of Einstein's equations, although well-posedness of the
boundary problem is no longer ensured. We discuss to what extent such a formal
application might be implemented in a constraint preserving manner to 3+1

wind-wind interaction responsible for the strong X-ray emission. Although the
overall shape of the X-ray light curve can be explained by the high
eccentricity of the binary orbit, other features like the asymmetry near
periastron passage and the short quasi-periodic oscillations seen at those
epochs, have not yet been accounted for. In this paper we explain these
features assuming that the rotation axis of eta Carinae is not perpendicular to
the orbital plane of the binary system. As a consequence, the companion star
will face eta Carinae on the orbital plane at different latitudes for different
orbital phases and, since both the mass loss rate and the wind velocity are
latitude dependent, they would produce the observed asymmetries in the X-ray
flux. We were able to reproduce the main features of the X-ray light curve
assuming that the rotation axis of eta Carinae forms an angle of 29 degrees
with the axis of the binary orbit. We also explained the short quasi-periodic
oscillations by assuming nutation of the rotation axis, with amplitude of about
5 degrees and period of about 22 days. The nutation parameters, as well as the
precession of the apsis, with a period of about 274 years, are consistent with
what is expected from the torques induced by the companion star.

background. The surface brightness of the background, as reported by the ARCADE

currently observed radio sources. We consider contributions to the background
from diffuse synchrotron emission from clusters and the intergalactic medium,
previously unrecognized flux from low surface brightness regions of radio
sources, and faint point sources below the flux limit of existing surveys. By
examining radio source counts available in the literature, we conclude that
most of the radio background is produced by radio point sources that dominate
at sub microJy fluxes. We show that a truly diffuse background produced by
electrons far from galaxes is ruled out because such energetic electrons would
overproduce the obserevd X-ray/gamma-ray background through inverse Compton
scattering of the other photon fields. Unrecognized flux from low surface
brightness regions of extended radio sources, or moderate flux sources missed
entirely by radio source count surveys, cannot explain the bulk of the observed
background, but may contribute as much as 10 per cent. We consider both radio
supernovae and radio quiet quasars as candidate sources for the background, and
show that both fail to produce it at the observed level because of insufficient
number of objects and total flux, although radio quiet quasars contribute at
the level of at least a few percent. We conclude that if the radio background
is at the level reported, a majority of the total surface brightness would have
to be produced by ordinary starforming galaxies above redshift 1 characterized
by an evolving radio far-infrared correlation, which changes toward the radio
loud with redshift.

In a dot plot, a substring to substring distance is computed for all pairs of
fixed-size windows in the input strings. Commonly, the Hamming distance is used
since it can be computed in linear time. However, the Hamming distance is a
rather crude measure of string similarity, and using an alignment-based edit
distance can greatly improve the sensitivity of the dot plot method. In this
paper, we show how to compute alignment plots of the latter type efficiently.
Given two strings of length m and n and a window size w, this problem consists
in computing the edit distance between all pairs of substrings of length w, one
from each input string. The problem can be solved by repeated application of
the standard dynamic programming algorithm in time O(mnw^2). This paper gives
an improved data-parallel algorithm, running in time $O(mnw/\gamma/p)$ using
vector operations that work on $\gamma$ values in parallel and $p$ processors.
We show experimental results from an implementation of this algorithm, which
uses Intel's MMX/SSE instructions for vector parallelism and MPI for
coarse-grained parallelism.

with respect to radial and azimuthal resolution. As vertical resolution is
improved, the ratio of stress to pressure increases only slowly, but the
absolute levels of both the stress and the pressure increase noticeably. The
vertical correlation length of the magnetic field within the core of the disk

decreases slowly as vertical resolution increases. We suggest that this greater
degree of correlation in stratified than unstratified disks, even near the

instability drives the magnetic field upwelling at several scaleheights from
the midplane that is characteristic of stratified MHD-turbulent disks.

statistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that
human communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also
explain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a
generalized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling
law between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and
their level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding
economic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its
origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns in
human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire period of the
available data of more than one year. Further, we provide a mathematical
framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's law to the long-term
correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same underlying mechanism could be
the source of Gibrat's law in economics, ranging from large firms, research and
development expenditures, gross domestic product of countries, to city
population growth. These findings are also of importance for designing
communication networks and for the understanding of the dynamics of social

emission sources in the RS Vulpeculae interacting binary. The 2D tomogram of

star with additional evidence of gas flowing close to the predicted trajectory.
However, the 3D tomogram revealed surprising evidence of a more pronounced gas
stream flow at high $V_z$ velocities from -240 to -360 km s{$^{-1}$}. This
behavior is most likely caused by magnetic activity on the cool star since the
central velocity plane, defined by $V_z$ = 0 km s{$^{-1}$}, should be
coincident with the orbital plane of the binary if the flow is dominated by
gravitational forces only. RS Vul has been detected as both an X-ray and a
radio source, and it is possible that the RS Vul gas stream may have been
deflected by magnetic field lines. This flow is distinctly different from that
found in the streamlike state of U CrB, in which the gas flow was confined
mostly to the central velocity plane.

conditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the

approach to study content replication: computing the number and placement of
replicas in a network can be cast as an uncapacitated facility location
problem. The endeavour of this work is to design a distributed, lightweight
solution to the above joint optimization problem, while taking into account the

the burden of storing and providing content, so as to achieve load balancing,
and decide whether to replicate or drop the information so as to adapt to a
dynamic content demand and time-varying topology. We evaluate our mechanism
through simulation, by exploring a wide range of settings and studying
realistic content access mechanisms that go beyond the traditional
assumptionmatching demand points to their closest content replica. Results show
that our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely
precise in approximating an optimal solution to content placement and
replication; (ii) robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in
accommodating various content access patterns, including variation in time and

structure of the central galactic halo reveals the presence of a dark disk
component, that is co-rotating with the stellar disk. At the Earth's location,
it contributes to around 25% of the total DM local density, whose value is
rho_DM ~ 0.37 GeV/cm^3. The velocity distributions also show strong deviations
from pure Gaussian and Maxwellian distributions, with a sharper drop of the

whether the modulation signal observed by DAMA is or is not excluded by limits
set by other experiments (CDMS, XENON and CRESST...) is re-analyzed and

the other experiments is improved. In the elastic scenario, the DAMA modulation
signal is slightly enhanced in the so-called channeling region, as a result of
several effects. For the inelastic scenario, the improvement of the fit is
mainly attributable to the departure from a Maxwellian distribution at high

and considers worst-case bounds for the size of the result Q(D) of a
conjunctive query Q to a database D given an arbitrary set of functional
dependencies. The bounds in [GLV] are based on a ""coloring"" of the query
variables. In order to extend the previous bounds to the setting of arbitrary
functional dependencies, we leverage tools from information theory to formalize
the original intuition that each color used represents some possible entropy of
that variable, and bound the maximum possible size increase via a linear
program that seeks to maximize how much more entropy is in the result of the
query than the input. This new view allows us to precisely characterize the
entropy structure of worst-case instances for conjunctive queries with simple
functional dependencies (keys), providing new insights into the results of
[GLV]. We extend these results to the case of general functional dependencies,
providing upper and lower bounds on the worst-case size increase. We identify
the fundamental connection between the gap in these bounds and a central open
question in information theory.
  Finally, we show that, while both the upper and lower bounds are given by
exponentially large linear programs, one can distinguish in polynomial time

fragments in molecular clouds with mass-to-flux ratios greater than that of the
parent-cloud envelope. By contrast, scenarios of turbulence-induced
fragmentation do not yield such a robust prediction. Based on this property,
Crutcher et al. (2009) proposed an observational test that could potentially
discriminate between fragmentation theories. However, the analysis applied to
the data severely restricts the discriminative power of the test: the authors
conclude that they can only constrain what they refer to as the ""idealized""
ambipolar-diffusion theory that assumes initially straight-parallel magnetic
field lines in the parent cloud. We present an original, self-consistent
analysis of the same data taking into account the nonuniformity of the magnetic
field in the cloud envelopes, which is suggested by the data themselves, and we
discuss important geometrical effects that must be accounted for in using this
test. We show quantitatively that the quality of current data does not allow
for a strong conclusion about any fragmentation theory. Given the
discriminative potential of the test, we urge for more and better-quality data.

environment since z=1 using a large well defined set of groups and galaxies
from the zCOSMOS-bright redshift survey in the COSMOS field. The fraction of
galaxies with early-type morphologies increases monotonically with M_B
luminosity and stellar mass and with cosmic epoch. It is higher in the groups
than elsewhere, especially at later epochs. The emerging environmental effect
is superposed on a strong global mass-driven evolution, and at z~0.5 and
log(M*/Msol)~10.2, the ""effect"" of group environment is equivalent to (only)
about 0.2 dex in stellar mass or 2 Gyr in time. The stellar mass function of
galaxies in groups is enriched in massive galaxies. We directly determine the
transformation rates from late to early morphologies, and for transformations
involving colour and star formation indicators. The transformation rates are
systematically about twice as high in the groups as outside, or up to 3-4 times
higher correcting for infall and the appearance of new groups. The rates reach
values, for masses around the crossing mass 10^10.5 Msol, as high as
(0.3-0.7)/Gyr in the groups, implying transformation timescales of 1.4-3 Gyr,
compared with less than 0.2/Gyr, i.e. timescales >5 Gyr, outside of groups. All
three transformation rates decrease at higher stellar masses, and must decrease
also at the lower masses below 10^10 Msol which we cannot well probe. The rates
involving colour and star formation are consistently higher than those for
morphology, by a factor of about 50%. Our conclusion is that the
transformations which drive the evolution of the overall galaxy population
since z~1 must occur at a rate 2-4 times higher in groups than outside of them.

transform under both the new strong force as well as in a chiral representation
of the electroweak group, acquiring mass from the Higgs mechanism. Electric
charge neutrality of the lightest baryon requires approximately degenerate
quirk masses which also causes the charge radius of the bound state to be
negligible. The abundance is determined by an asymmetry that is linked to the
baryon and lepton numbers of the universe through electroweak sphalerons. Dark
matter elastic scattering with nuclei proceeds through Higgs exchange as well
as an electromagnetic polarizability operator which is just now being tested in
direct detection experiments. A novel method to search for quirky dark matter
is to look for a gamma-ray dark line spectroscopic feature in galaxy clusters
that result from the quirky Lyman-alpha or quirky hyperfine transitions.
Colliders are expected to dominantly produce quirky mesons, not quirky baryons,
consequently large missing energy is not the primary collider signal of the

to explain this evolution, which have different implications for galaxy, star,

of redshift and use them to test proposed models. Evolution in progenitor
gas-richness with redshift gives rise to initial formation of smaller spheroids
at high-z. These systems can then evolve in apparent or physical size via
several channels: (1) equal-density 'dry' mergers, (2) later major or minor
'dry' mergers with less-dense galaxies, (3) adiabatic expansion, (4) evolution

galaxy 3C 120 between 2002 and 2007 at X-ray, optical, and radio wave bands, as
well as imaging with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Over the 5 yr of
observation, significant dips in the X-ray light curve are followed by
ejections of bright superluminal knots in the VLBA images. Consistent with
this, the X-ray flux and 37 GHz flux are anti-correlated with X-ray leading the
radio variations. This implies that, in this radio galaxy, the radiative state
of accretion disk plus corona system, where the X-rays are produced, has a
direct effect on the events in the jet, where the radio emission originates.
The X-ray power spectral density of 3C 120 shows a break, with steeper slope at
shorter timescale and the break timescale is commensurate with the mass of the
central black hole based on observations of Seyfert galaxies and black hole
X-ray binaries. These findings provide support for the paradigm that black hole
X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei are fundamentally similar systems,
with characteristic time and size scales linearly proportional to the mass of
the central black hole. The X-ray and optical variations are strongly
correlated in 3C 120, which implies that the optical emission in this object
arises from the same general region as the X-rays, i.e., in the accretion
disk-corona system. We numerically model multi-wavelength light curves of 3C
120 from such a system with the optical-UV emission produced in the disk and
the X-rays generated by scattering of thermal photons by hot electrons in the
corona. From the comparison of the temporal properties of the model light
curves to that of the observed variability, we constrain the physical size of
the corona and the distances of the emitting regions from the central BH.

explicitly in the Virasoro case of N_c=2, by bringing the dimensions of
external states to infinity. The calculation is performed entirely in terms of
representation theory for the Virasoro algebra and reproduces the answers
conjectured in arXiv:0908.0307 with the help of the brane-compactification

coherent rather than primary external states.

Superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) have an ""excess""
frequency noise that shows up as a small time dependent jitter of the resonance
frequency characterized by the frequency noise power spectrum measured in units
of Hz^2/Hz. Recent studies have shown that this noise almost certainly
originates from a surface layer of two-level system (TLS) defects on the
metallization or substrate. Fluctuation of these TLSs introduces noise in the
resonator due to coupling of the TLS electric dipole moments to the resonator's
electric field. Motivated by a semi-empirical quantitative theory of this noise
mechanism, we have designed and tested new resonator geometries in which the
high-field ""capacitive"" portion of the CPW resonator is replaced by an
interdigitated capacitor (IDC) structure with 10 - 20 micron electrode spacing,
as compared to the 2 micron spacing used for our more conventional CPW
resonators. Measurements show that this new IDC design has dramatically lower
TLS noise, currently by about a factor of ~29 in terms of the frequency noise
power spectrum, corresponding to an improvement of about a factor of 29^(1/2)
in NEP. These new devices are replacing the CPW resonators in our next design
iteration in progress for MKIDCam. Opportunities and prospects for future
reduction of the TLS noise will be discussed.

by the time evolution of its base radius R(t). In complete wetting the
quasistationary regime (far away from initial and final transients) typically
obeys the so-called Tanner law, with R t^alpha_T, alpha_T=1/10. Late-time
spreading may differ significantly from the Tanner law: in some cases the drop
does not thin down to a molecular film and instead reaches an equilibrium
pancake-like shape; in other situations, as revealed by recent experiments with
spontaneously spreading nematic crystals, the growth of the base radius
accelerates after the Tanner stage. Here we demonstrate that these two
seemingly conflicting trends can be reconciled within a suitably revisited
energy balance approach, by taking into account the line tension contribution
to the driving force of spreading: a positive line tension is responsible for
the formation of pancake-like structures, whereas a negative line tension tends
to lengthen the contact line and induces an accelerated spreading (a transition
to a faster power law for R(t) than in the Tanner stage).

argued that the foot points of the molecular loops, two bright spots at both

carried out sensitive CO observations of the foot points toward l=356 deg at a
few pc resolution in the six rotational transitions of CO; 12CO(J=1-0, 3-2,
4-3, 7-6), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0). The high resolution image of 12CO
(J=3-2) has revealed the detailed distribution of the high excitation gas
including U shapes, the outer boundary of which shows sharp intensity jumps
accompanying strong velocity gradients. An analysis of the multi-J CO
transitions shows that the temperature is in a range from 30-100 K and density
is around 10^3-10^4 cm^-3, confirming that the foot points have high
temperature and density although there is no prominent radiative heating source
such as high mass stars in or around the loops. We argue that the high
temperature is likely due to the shock heating under C-shock condition caused
by the magnetic flotation. We made a comparison of the gas distribution with
theoretical numerical simulations and note that the U shape is consistent with
numerical simulations. We also find that the region of highest temperature of
~100 K or higher inside the U shape corresponds to the spur having an upward
flow, additionally heated up either by magnetic reconnection or bouncing in the
interaction with the narrow neck at the bottom of the U shape. We note these
new findings further reinforce the magnetic floatation interpretation.

recently been shown to be sum capacity achieving for the two-user single-input
single-output (SISO) Gaussian interference channel in a low interference
regime, where the interference levels are below certain thresholds. In this
paper, such a low interference regime is characterized for multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interference channels. Conditions are provided
on the direct and cross channel gain matrices under which using Gaussian inputs
and treating interference as noise at the receivers is sum capacity achieving.
For the special cases of the symmetric multiple-input single-output (MISO) and
single-input multiple-output (SIMO) Gaussian interference channels, more
explicit expressions for the low interference regime are derived. In
particular, the threshold on the interference levels that characterize low
interference regime is related to the input SNR and the angle between the
direct and cross channel gain vectors. It is shown that the low interference
regime can be quite significant for MIMO interference channels, with the low
interference threshold being at least as large as the sine of the angle between
the direct and cross channel gain vectors for the MISO and SIMO cases.

which is attached to a rigid body while the other end is attached to an
inertially fixed reel mechanism which allows the unstretched length of the
string to be dynamically varied. The string is assumed to have distributed mass
and elasticity that permits axial deformations. The rigid body is attached to
the string at an arbitrary point, and the resulting string pendulum system
exhibits nontrivial coupling between the elastic wave propagation in the string
and the rigid body dynamics. Variational methods are used to develop coupled
ordinary and partial differential equations of motion. Computational methods,
referred to as Lie group variational integrators, are then developed, based on
a finite element approximation and the use of variational methods in a
discrete-time setting to obtain discrete-time equations of motion. This
approach preserves the geometry of the configurations, and leads to accurate
and efficient algorithms that have guaranteed accuracy properties that make
them suitable for many dynamic simulations, especially over long simulation
times. Numerical results are presented for typical examples involving a
constant length string, string deployment, and string retrieval. These
demonstrate the complicated dynamics that arise in a string pendulum from the
interaction of the rigid body motion, elastic wave dynamics in the string, and
the disturbances introduced by the reeling mechanism. Such interactions are
dynamically important in many engineering problems, but tend be obscured in
lower fidelity models.

this report we elucidate the electronic properties for these magnetic states,
and show that the electronic and magnetic properties are strongly coupled in
this system. The electronic ground state evolves from an AFM
quasi-two-dimensional metal for $x =$ 1.0, to an Anderson localized state for
$0.4 \leq x < 1.0$ (the AFM region). When the magnetic state undergoes a
transition from the AFM to the nearly FM state, the electronic ground state
switches to a weakly localized state induced by magnetic scattering for $0.25

resistivity $\rho_{ab} \propto T^\alpha$ ($\alpha >$ 2) for $0.08 < x < 0.25$.

magnetic ground state enters the itinerant metamagnetic state for $x < 0.08$.

formation in the inner region of the galaxy. The circumnuclear starburst is so

The accretion of stars onto the central supermassive black hole at the
center of the Milky Way is predicted to generate large fluxes of
subrelativistic ions in the Galactic center region. We analyze the intensity,
shape and spatial distribution of de-excitation gamma-ray lines produced by
nuclear interactions of these energetic particles with the ambient medium.
  Methods. We first estimate the amount and mean kinetic energy of particles
released from the central black hole during star disruption. We then calculate
from a kinetic equation the energy and spatial distributions of these particles
in the Galactic center region. These particle distributions are then used to
derive the characteristics of the main nuclear interaction gamma-ray lines.
  Results. Because the time period of star capture by the supermassive black
hole is expected to be shorter than the lifetime of the ejected fast particles
against Coulomb losses, the gamma-ray emission is predicted to be stationary.
We find that the nuclear de-excitation lines should be emitted from a region of
maximum 5$^\circ$ angular radius. The total gamma-ray line flux below 8 MeV is
calculated to be $\approx10^{-4}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The most
promising lines for detection are those at 4.44 and $\sim$6.2 MeV, with a
predicted flux in each line of $\approx$$10^{-5}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that this emission can be detected with the
INTEGRAL observatory. But the predicted line intensities appear to be within
reach of future gamma-ray space instruments. A future detection of
de-excitation gamma-ray lines from the Galactic center region would provide
unique information on the high-energy processes induced by the central
supermassive black hole and the physical conditions of the emitting region.

solution of a system of $n$ complex polynomials in $n$ unknowns in time
polynomial, on the average, in the size $N$ of the input system. A partial
solution to this problem was given by Carlos Beltran and Luis Miguel Pardo who
exhibited a randomized algorithm doing so. In this paper we further extend this
result in several directions. Firstly, we exhibit a linear homotopy algorithm
that efficiently implements a non-constructive idea of Mike Shub. This
algorithm is then used in a randomized algorithm, call it LV, a la
Beltran-Pardo. Secondly, we perform a smoothed analysis (in the sense of
Spielman and Teng) of algorithm LV and prove that its smoothed complexity is
polynomial in the input size and $\sigma^{-1}$, where $\sigma$ controls the
size of of the random perturbation of the input systems. Thirdly, we perform a
condition-based analysis of LV. That is, we give a bound, for each system $f$,
of the expected running time of LV with input $f$. In addition to its
dependence on $N$ this bound also depends on the condition of $f$. Fourthly,
and to conclude, we return to Smale's 17th problem as originally formulated for
deterministic algorithms. We exhibit such an algorithm and show that its
average complexity is $N^{O(\log\log N)}$. This is nearly a solution to Smale's
17th problem.

Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Japanese Hinode spacecraft. These
previously unrecognized type II spicules are thin chromospheric jets that are
shorter-lived (10-60 s) and that show much higher apparent upward velocities
(of order 50-100 km/s) than the classical spicules. Since they have been
implicated in providing hot plasma to coronal loops, their formation, evolution
and properties are important ingredients for a better understanding of the mass
and energy balance of the low solar atmosphere. Here we report on the discovery
of the disk counterparts of type II spicules using spectral imaging data in the
Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter
(CRISP) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma. We find rapid
blueward excursions in the line profiles of both chromospheric lines that
correspond to thin, jet-like features that show apparent velocities of order 50
km/s. These blueward excursions seem to form a separate absorbing component
with Doppler shifts of order 20 and 50 km/s for the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha
line respectively. We show that the appearance, lifetimes, longitudinal and
transverse velocities and occurrence rate of these rapid blue excursions on the
disk are very similar to those of the type II spicules at the limb. A detailed
study of the spectral line profiles in these events suggests that plasma is
accelerated along the jet, and plasma is being heated throughout the short
lifetime of the event.

grows at a definite speed with the size of the system.

none-zero temperature and density by calculating the quark number and isospin
susceptibilities and their derivatives with respect to $\mu_q$. To suppress
statistical fluctuations, we also examine new techniques applicable at low

critical point at finite $\mu_q$ terminating the first order transition line

we study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of
well-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively
low velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.
The latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective
repulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via
an effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that
stationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear
continuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic
oscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the
stability of such structures. We find that for a sufficiently large number of
atoms, multiple soliton states may be dynamically stable, while for a small
number of atoms, we predict a dynamical instability emerging from resonance
effects between the eigenfrequencies of the soliton modes and the intrinsic
excitation frequencies of the condensate. Finally we present experimental
realizations of multi-soliton states including a three-soliton state consisting
of two solitons oscillating around a stationary one.

on data. In any numerical approach to the solution of such problems,
regularization of some form is needed to counteract the resulting instability.
This paper is based on an approach to regularization, employing a Bayesian
formulation of the problem, which leads to a notion of well-posedness for
inverse problems, at the level of probability measures.
  The stability which results from this well-posedness may be used as the basis
for quantifying the approximation, in finite dimensional spaces, of inverse
problems for functions. This paper contains a theory which utilizes the
stability to estimate the distance between the true and approximate posterior
distributions, in the Hellinger metric, in terms of error estimates for
approximation of the underlying forward problem. This is potentially useful as
it allows for the transfer of estimates from the numerical analysis of forward
problems into estimates for the solution of the related inverse problem. In
particular controlling differences in the Hellinger metric leads to control on
the differences between expected values of polynomially bounded functions and
operators, including the mean and covariance operator.
  The ideas are illustrated with the classical inverse problem for the heat
equation, and then applied to some more complicated non-Gaussian inverse
problems arising in data assimilation, involving determination of the initial
condition for the Stokes or Navier-Stokes equation from Lagrangian and Eulerian
observations respectively.

the barriers, we investigate their role on the glass transition. Dynamic
observables are analyzed within the framework of the Mode Coupling Theory
(MCT). Critical nonergodicity parameters, critical temperatures and dynamic
exponents are obtained from consistent fits of simulation data to MCT
asymptotic laws. The so-obtained MCT $\lambda$-exponent increases from standard
values for fully-flexible chains to values close to the upper limit for stiff
chains. In analogy with systems exhibiting higher-order MCT transitions, we
suggest that the observed large $\lambda$-values arise form the interplay
between two distinct mechanisms for dynamic arrest: general packing effects and
polymer-specific intramolecular barriers. We compare simulation results with
numerical solutions of the MCT equations for polymer systems, within the
polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) for static correlations. We
verify that the approximations introduced by the PRISM are fulfilled by
simulations, with the same quality for all the range of investigated barrier
strength. The numerical solutions reproduce the qualitative trends of
simulations for the dependence of the nonergodicity parameters and critical
temperatures on the barrier strength. In particular, the increase of the
barrier strength at fixed density increases the localization length and the
critical temperature. However the qualitative agreement between theory and
simulation breaks in the limit of stiff chains. We discuss the possible origin

studied. The effects of the central body on the equilibrium state of the discs
are modeled by an axial total current and a dipole magnetic field. Studying the
amplification of high-frequency waves shows that Keplerian discs can be
destabilized due to combined effects of equilibrium density stratification and
poloidal magnetic field. By considering a boundary value problem in the limit
of strong Hall effect, it is shown that whistler waves which are free of direct

Here we report on an experiment on graphite, a macroscopic stack of graphene
layers, which establishes a fundamental link between dimensionality of an
electronic system and its Nernst response. In sharp contrast with single-layer
graphene, the Nernst signal sharply peaks whenever a Landau level meets the
Fermi level. This points to the degrees of freedom provided by finite
interlayer coupling as a source of enhanced thermoelectric response in the
vicinity of the quantum limit. Since Landau quantization slices a
three-dimensional Fermi surface, each intersection of a Landau level with the
Fermi level modifies the Fermi surface topology. According to our results, the
most prominent signature of such a topological phase transition emerges in the
transverse thermoelectric response.

greatest mysteries in modern cosmology. We present a new mechanism for
generation of large-scale magnetic field, based on the power-counting
renormalizable theory of gravitation recently proposed by Horava. Contrary to
the usual case in general relativity, the U(1) gauge symmetry of a Maxwell
action in this theory permits terms breaking conformal invariance in the
ultraviolet. Moreover, for high frequency modes, the anisotropic scaling
intrinsic to the theory inevitably makes the sound horizon far outside the
Hubble horizon. Consequently, non-inflationary cosmic expansion in the early
universe naturally generates super-horizon quantum fluctuations of the magnetic
field. Specializing our consideration to the case with the dynamical critical
exponent $z=3$, we show an explicit set of parameters for which (i) the
amplitude of generated magnetic field is large enough as a seed for the dynamo
mechanism; (ii) backreaction to the cosmic expansion is small enough; and (iii)
the high-energy dispersion relation is consistent with the most recent
observational limits from MAGIC and FERMI.

Monte Carlo Markov Chain parameter estimation technique constraining the model
with the $K$-band luminosity function, $B-V$ colours and the black hole-bulge
mass relation. The differences in parameter correlations, and in the allowed
regions in likelihood space, reveal the impact of the new physics on the basic
ingredients of the model, such as the star-formation laws, feedback recipes and
the black hole growth model. With satellite disruption in place, we get a model
likelihood four times higher than in the original model, indicating that the
new process seems to be favoured by observations. This is achieved mainly due
to a reduction in black hole growth that produces a better agreement between
the properties of central black holes and host galaxies. Compared to the
best-fit model without disruption, the new model removes the excess of dwarf
galaxies in the original recipe with a more modest supernova heating. The new
model is now consistent with the three observational data sets used to
constrain it, while significantly improving the agreement with observations for
the distribution of metals in stars. Moreover, the model now follows the build
up of intra-cluster light.

function of each density component of these systems is defined as the sum of an
arbitrary number of Cuddeford distribution functions with arbitrary values of
the anisotropy radius, but identical angular momentum exponent. The radial
trend of anisotropy that can be realized by these models is therefore very
general. As a surprising by-product of our study, we found that the ``central
cusp-anisotropy theorem'' (a necessary condition for consistency relating the
values of the central density slope and of the anisotropy parameter) holds not
only at the center, but at all radii in consistent multi-component generalized
Cuddeford systems. This last result suggests that the so--called

$\phi$. This comes from a suitable definition of an energy momentum tensor of
the ""dark"" component that respects to a local energy conservation in the Jordan
frame. In this framework the horizon entropy $S$ corresponding to equilibrium
thermodynamics is equal to a quarter of the horizon area $A$ in units of
gravitational constant $G$, as in Einstein gravity. For a flat cosmological
background with a decreasing Hubble parameter, $S$ globally increases with
time, as it happens for viable $f(R)$ inflation and dark energy models. We also
show that the equilibrium description in terms of the horizon entropy $S$ is
convenient because it takes into account the contribution of both the horizon
entropy $\hat{S}$ in non-equilibrium thermodynamics and an entropy production
term.

one to superimpose two independent trapping potentials, each being effective
only on one atomic kind, while transparent to the other. When the environment
is homogeneous and the impurities are confined in a potential consisting of a
set of double wells, the system can be described in terms of an effective
spin-boson model, where the occupation of the left or right well of each site
represents the two (pseudo)-spin states. The irreversible dynamics of such
system is here studied exactly, i.e., not in terms of a Markovian master
equation. The dynamics of one and two impurities is remarkably different in
respect of the standard decoherence of the spin - boson system. In particular
we show: i) the appearance of coherence oscillations, i) the presence of super
and sub decoherent states which differ from the standard ones of the spin boson
model, and iii) the persistence of coherence in the system at long times. We
show that this behaviour is due to the fact that the pseudospins have an
internal spatial structure. We argue that collective decoherence also prompts
information about the correlation length of the environment. In a one
dimensional configuration one can change even stronger the qualitative
behaviour of the dephasing just by tuning the interaction of the bath.

gravitational lenses to the general properties of the internal structure of
dark matter haloes. Our analytical theory for the GNFW lenses with parametrized
cusp slope (alpha) gives us a relation connecting the cusp slope of the lensing
profile to the observed magnification ratio of the produced images and location
of the optical axis. The relation does not depend on cosmology, total lens
mass, concentration or redshifts of the the lens and the lensed object. Simple
geometry of axially symmetric lensing and aforementioned relation enables us to
define a threshold value alpha_CSL for the cusp slope, independent from
location of the optical axis. The threshold cusp slope value alpha=alpha_CSL is
the shallowest slope for the inner part of the GNFW profile that can produce
the observed magnification ratio with any lensing configuration. We use
distribution of these threshold values in a statistical study of the double
image lenses in order to limit the possible cusp slope values, and identify
whether there exists a population of haloes with similar profiles. Our
theoretical fit indicates that within our sample of double image gravitational
lenses, most of the haloes have cusp slope alpha=-1.95 +/- 0.02. We have also
found an indication of a second population of lenses with a cusp slope value
alpha=-1.49 +/- 0.09. We estimate that there is about 99 per cent probability
that the observed feature in the threshold value limit distribution is produced
by the second population of lenses, with their own characteristic density

from LTE at low metallicity. The NLTE abundance of Co in solar photosphere is
4.95 +/- 0.04 dex, which is in agreement with that in C I meteorites within the
combined uncertainties. The spectral lines of Co I were calculated using the
results of recent measurements of hyperfine interaction constants by UV Fourier

hyperfine structure splitting A and B factors were performed. A differential
abundance analysis of Co is carried out for 18 stars in the metallicity range

At low [Fe/H], NLTE abundance corrections for Co I lines are as large as +0.6

underestimated. The stellar NLTE abundances determined from the single UV line
of Co II are lower by ~0.5-0.6 dex. The discrepancy might be attributed to
possible blends that have not been accounted for in the solar Co II line and
its erroneous oscillator strength. The increasing [Co/Fe] trend in metal-poor

UGC11763 to characterize the different components that are emitting and
absorbing radiation in the vicinity of the active nucleus.
  Methods. The continuum emission was studied through the EPIC spectra taking
profit of the spectral range of these cameras. The high resolution RGS spectra
were analyzed in order to characterize the absorbing features and the emission
line features that arise in the spectra of this source.
  Results. A power law with a photon index \Gamma = 1.72^{+0.03}_{-0.01}
accounts for the continuum emission of this source in the hard X-rays from 10
down to 1 keV. At lower energies, a black body model with kT= 0.100\pm 0.003
keV provides a good description of the observed soft excess. The absorption
signatures in the spectra of UGC11763 are consistent with the presence of a two
phase ionized material (log U=1.65^{+0.07}_{-0.08}; 2.6\pm 0.1 and log N_{H} =
21.2\pm 0.2; 21.51\pm 0.01 cm^{-2}, respectively) in the line of sight. The
physical conditions found are consistent with the two phases being in pressure
equilibrium. The low ionization component is more ionized than typically found
for warm absorbers in other Seyfert 1 galaxies. There are also signatures of
some emission lines: Ovii He$\alpha$(r), Ovii He$\alpha$(f), a blend of the
Neix He$\alpha$ triplet and Fexviii at \lambda 17.5 \AA.

velocity field stemming from geodynamo simulations leads to an exponential
growth of the magnetic field in a corresponding kinematic calculation. We
perform global self-consistent geodynamo simulations and calculate the
evolution of a kinematically advanced tracer field. The self-consistent
velocity field enters the induction equation in each time step, but the tracer
field does not contribute to the Lorentz force. This experiment has been
performed by Cattaneo & Tobias (2009) and is closely related to the test field
method by Schrinner et al. (2005, 2007). We find two dynamo regimes in which
the tracer field either grows exponentially or approaches a state aligned with
the actual self-consistent magnetic field after an initial transition period.
Both regimes can be distinguished by the Rossby number and coincide with the
dipolar and multipolar dynamo regimes identified by Christensen & Aubert
(2006). Dipolar dynamos with low Rossby number are kinematically stable whereas
the tracer field grows exponentially in the multipolar dynamo regime. This
difference in the saturation process for dynamos in both regimes comes along
with differences in their time variability. Within our sample of 20 models,
solely kinematically unstable dynamos show dipole reversals and large
excursions. The complicated time behaviour of these dynamos presumably relates
to the alternating growth of several competing dynamo modes. On the other hand,
dynamos in the low Rossby number regime exhibit a rather simple time dependence
and their saturation merely results in a fluctuation of the fundamental dynamo
mode about its critical state.

homogeneous equations in the Plucker coordinates of $ \mathbb G$ and covered by
open subsets given by the non-vanishing of a Plucker coordinate, each embedded

the number $E$ of Plucker coordinates is so large that effective computations

the symmetries of $\hilb^n_p(t)$, we exhibit a new open cover, consisting of
marked schemes over Borel-fixed ideals, whose number is significantly smaller

cross-correlation line profiles with high signal-to-noise ratio to detect
polarized Zeeman signatures. From three phase-resolved data sets collected

  Results. The comparison of the magnetic maps shows that a polarity reversal

and indefinite inner-product spaces are then discussed. The main part of the
paper introduces a quantum integral and derives some of its properties. The
quantum integral's form for simple functions is characterized and it is shown
that the quantum integral generalizes the Lebesgue integral. A bounded,
monotone convergence theorem for quantum integrals is obtained and it is shown
that a Radon-Nikodym type theorem does not hold for quantum measures. As an
example, a quantum-Lebesgue integral on the real line is considered.

density cusps at the centers of dark matter halos, and problems producing
realistic disk galaxies in simulations are issues that have raised concerns
about the viability of the standard cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) scenario for
galaxy formation. This article reviews these issues, and considers the
implications for cold vs. various varieties of warm dark matter (WDM). The
current evidence appears to be consistent with standard LambdaCDM, although
improving data may point toward a rather tepid version of LambdaWDM -- tepid
since the dark matter cannot be very warm without violating observational
constraints.
