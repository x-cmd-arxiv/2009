relative rate of diffractive event categories at the LHC energies. By
identifying diffractive events, detailed studies on proton structure can be
carried out.
  The combined forward physics objects: rapidity gaps, forward multiplicity and
transverse energy flows can be used to efficiently classify proton-proton
collisions. Data samples recorded by the forward detectors, with a simple
extension, will allow first estimates of the single diffractive (SD), double
diffractive (DD), central diffractive (CD), and non-diffractive (ND) cross
sections. The approach, which uses the measurement of inelastic activity in
forward and central detector systems, is complementary to the detection and
measurement of leading beam-like protons.
  In this investigation, three different multivariate analysis approaches are
assessed in classifying forward physics processes at the LHC. It is shown that
with gene expression programming, neural networks and support vector machines,
diffraction can be efficiently identified within a large sample of simulated
proton-proton scattering events. The event characteristics are visualized by
using the self-organizing map algorithm.

results in a mass shift of all massive particles near a black hole. It is shown
that the obtained potential depends on the space point through the metric

arbitrary static, spherically symmetric background. Some properties of this
potential are investigated. In particular, if the conformal symmetry holds
valid for massless particles on the given background, there exist only two
possible scenarios depending on a sign of an arbitrary constant arising from
the regularization procedure: the masses of all massive particles grow
infinitely when they approach the black hole horizon, or the gauge symmetry is
restored at a finite distance from the horizon and all particles become
massless. If the conformal symmetry is spoiled, an additional term in the

a marked non-Newtonian behavior, exhibiting the typical signature of shear
thickening. Specifically, a transition is observed from a Newtonian to a shear
thickening regime at a critical shear rate $\dot{\gamma}_c$. The value of this
critical shear rate as a function of T follows an Arrhenius behavior
$\dot{\gamma}_c(T)=$ B exp$(E_a/K_BT)$, with an activation energy $E_a$ close

  Improvement in Wireless Networks","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications, August 2009",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key feature in the design of any MAC protocol is the throughput it can
provide. In wireless networks, the channel of a user is not fixed but varies
randomly. Thus, in order to maximize the throughput of the MAC protocol at any
given time, only users with large channel gains should be allowed to transmit.
In this paper, compressive sensing based opportunistic protocol for throughput
improvement in wireless networks is proposed. The protocol is based on the
traditional protocol of R-ALOHA which allows users to compete for channel
access before reserving the channel to the best user. We use compressive
sensing to find the best user, and show that the proposed protocol requires
less time for reservation and so it outperforms other schemes proposed in
literature. This makes the protocol particularly suitable for enhancing R-ALOHA
in fast fading environments. We consider both analog and digital versions of
the protocol where the channel gains sent by the user are analog and digital,
respectively.

to the mean tangential equatorial velocity component to kinetic energy related

Systems with isotropic stress tensor are considered as adjoint configurations
to their counterparts with anisotropic stress tensor, different angular
momentum, and equal remaining parameters. Both nonequilibrium figures and
figures elongated by imaginary rotation are represented on the
ellipticity-rotation plane. An application is made to a reduced sample of
elliptical galaxies. The position on the ellipticity-rotation plane of both
sample objects and related adjoint configurations with isotropic stress tensor
is inferred from existing observations within the SAURON project. With a single
exception, slow rotators are characterized by low ellipticities, low anisotropy
parameters, and low rotation parameters, while the contrary holds for fast
rotators. A possible interpretation of slow rotators as nonrotating at all and
elongated due to negative anisotropy parameters, is exploited. Finally, the
elliptical side of the Hubble sequence is interpreted as a sequence of
equilibrium (adjoint) configurations where the ellipticity is an increasing
function of the rotation parameter, slow rotators correspond to early classes
and fast rotators to late classes. In this view, boundaries are rotationally
distorted regardless of angular momentum and stress tensor, where rotation has
to be intended as due to additional kinetic energy of tangential equatorial
velocity components, with respect to spherical configurations with isotropic
stress tensor.

bridge with very small length compared to the radius, we develop an effective
theory of Dirac fermions to account for the low-energy electronic properties of
the wormholes in the continuum limit, where the frustration induced by the
heptagonal defects is mimicked by a line of fictitious gauge flux attached to
each of them. We find in particular that, when the effective gauge flux from
the topological defects becomes maximal, the zero-energy modes of the Dirac
equation can be arranged into two triplets, that can be thought as the
counterpart of the two triplets of zero modes that arise in the dual instance
of the continuum limit of large spherical fullerenes. We further investigate
the graphene wormhole spectra by performing a numerical diagonalization of
tight-binding hamiltonians for very large lattices realizing the wormhole
geometry. The correspondence between the number of localized electronic states
observed in the numerical approach and the effective gauge flux predicted in
the continuum limit shows that graphene wormholes can be consistently described
by an effective theory of two Dirac fermion fields in the curved geometry of
the wormhole, opening the possibility of using real samples of the carbon

to the existence of Yukawian forces - predicted in the submillimeter range by
many unification models - from Casimir force experiments using the sphere-plane

analyses of the residuals from the Casimir force experiments performed so far,
and the second recently discussed in this context in R. Decca et al. [Phys.
Rev. D 79, 124021 (2009)]. We show that the former form of the proximity force
approximation overestimates the expected Yukawa force and that the relative
deviation from the exact Yukawa force is of the same order of magnitude, in the
realistic experimental settings, as the relative deviation expected between the
exact Casimir force and the Casimir force evaluated in the proximity force
approximation. This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to
the Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the
alpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used
in the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces. We further argue that
the recently discussed form for the proximity force approximation is
equivalent, for a geometry made of a generic object interacting with an
infinite planar slab, to the usual exact integration of any additive two-body
interaction, without any need to invoke approximation schemes. If the planar
slab is of finite size, an additional source of systematic error arises due to
the breaking of the planar translational invariance of the system, and we
finally discuss to what extent this may affect limits obtained on power-law and
Yukawa forces.

all four IRAC channels can be explained by models with and without a thermal
inversion in the atmosphere of TrES-2, although with different atmospheric
chemistry. Based on the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium, the chemical
composition of the inversion model seems more plausible, making it a more
favorable scenario. TrES-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiated
planets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions.
However, more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be needed
to confirm a thermal inversion in this system. Furthermore, we find that the
times of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published times
of transit and the expectation from a circular orbit. This implies that TrES-2
most likely has a circular orbit, and thus does not obtain additional thermal
energy from tidal dissipation of a non-zero orbital eccentricity, a proposed

invariants of link maps in Euclidean space; and (2) As a stable range
description, in terms of bordism, of the cross effects of the identity functor

Milnor invariants fit into the framework of a multivariable manifold calculus
of functors, as developed by the author and Voli\'{c}, which is itself a
generalization of the single variable version due to Weiss and Goodwillie.

  mixings)",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  One can describe cosmological relic neutrinos by adding Lagrange multipliers
to the Standard Model Lagrangian for them. The two possible Lagrange
multipliers are a chemical potential, which fixes the mean
neutrino/anti-neutrino asymmetry, and a Majorana mass, which fixes the mean
spin-entropy. Because these neutrinos originated from a thermal bath, their
entropy should be maximal, implying that each state in the background is a
symmetric superposition of a neutrino and anti-neutrino. Therefore the Standard
Model must be augmented by a flavor-diagonal Majorana neutrino mass matrix.
This impacts the propagator via tadpole diagrams due to self-interactions. In
the low-energy limit, neutrino self-interactions are entirely off-diagonal
because same-flavor four-fermion operators vanish by Pauli exclusion. These
interactions must be diagonalized when propagating through a bath of neutrinos,
using the U(3) global flavor symmetry. U(3) gets broken broken down to SO(3) by
Majorana masses, and down to $A_4$ if the three masses are different. Thus our
universe today contains tri-bimaximal mixing and Majorana neutrinos. Neutrino
mixing is due to the mismatch between the flavor-diagonal Majorana mass matrix
arising at finite density and the self-interaction diagonal finite density
propagator. The mass hierarchy is inverted and Majorana phases are absent.
Lepton number is conserved and the neutrino-less double beta decay experiment
absorbs a pair of neutrinos from the relic background and will prove their
Majorana nature.

proposed for high throughput wireless communications in a cellular scenario.
Transmissions occur in a time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion but with an important
difference: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. If more
than two users transmit in the same slot the collision cannot be resolved and
retransmission is required. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet
is recovered with some probability, depending on the state of the channel. If
two users transmit the collision is resolved and the packets are recovered by
first over-sampling the collision signal and then exploiting independent
information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase
components. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog
assumption and also under the assumption of finite backlog. The contention
probability is determined under these two assumptions in order to maximize the
network throughput and maintain stability. Queuing delay analysis for network
users is also conducted. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on the
Wireless Open Access Research Platform (WARP) test-bed containing five software
defined radio nodes. Analysis and test-bed results indicate that ALOHA-CR leads

lower [alpha/Fe] than Galactic halo field stars of comparable metallicity. This
indicates that star formation proceeded more gradually in Sculptor than in the

to the direction of the planet. The proximate cause of these is an increase in
the density of coronal plasma in the direction of the planet, which prevents
the corona from expanding and leaking away this plasma via a stellar wind. The
simulations produce significant low temperature heating. By including dynamical
effects, such as the planetary orbital motion, the simulation should better
reproduce the observed coronal heating.

quadrature by the STEREO spacecraft. We analyze this event using a
three-dimensional, global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the solar corona.
The numerical simulation is driven and constrained by the observations, and
indicates where magnetic reconnection occurs between the expanding CME core and
surrounding environment. We focus primarily on the lower corona, extending out
to $3R_{\odot}$; this range allows simultaneous comparison with both EUVI and
COR1 data. Our simulation produces a diffuse coronal bright front remarkably
similar to that observed by STEREO/EUVI at 195 \AA. It is made up of \emph{two}
components, and is the result of a combination of both wave and non-wave
mechanisms.
  The CME becomes large-scale quite low ($<$ 200 Mm) in the corona. It is not,
however, an inherently large-scale event; rather, the expansion is facilitated
by magnetic reconnection between the expanding CME core and the surrounding
magnetic environment. In support of this, we also find numerous secondary
dimmings, many far from the initial CME source region. Relating such dimmings
to reconnecting field lines within the simulation provides further evidence
that CME expansion leads to the ""opening"" of coronal field lines on a global
scale. Throughout the CME expansion, the coronal wave maps directly to the CME
footprint.
  Our results suggest that the ongoing debate over the ""true"" nature of diffuse
coronal waves may be mischaracterized. It appears that \emph{both} wave and
non-wave models are required to explain the observations and understand the
complex nature of these events.

out hydrodynamical simulations of a galaxy undergoing stripping with a focus on
the gas properties in the wake and their observational signatures. We include
radiative cooling in an adaptive hydrocode in order to investigate the impact
of a clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that including cooling
results in a very different morphology for the gas in the tail, with a much
wider range of temperatures and densities. The tail is significantly narrower
in runs with radiative cooling, in agreement with observed wakes. In addition,
we make detailed predictions of H I, Halpha and X-ray emission for the wake,
showing that we generally expect detectable H I and Halpha signatures, but no
observable X-ray emission (at least for our chosen ram-pressure strength and
ICM conditions). We find that the relative strength of the Halpha diagnostic

cooling to zero to mimic physics processes not included in the simulation).

data support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium has
altered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally
dominated system; however, this excess heating is primarily limited to the
central regions of clusters (r<0.15r_500). Second, the intrinsic scatter in the
center-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being undetected
at the <10% level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under
investigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or
Y_X-mass relations (10-15%). Third, the evolution with redshift of the scaling
relations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of
gravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating
the central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit
of our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved

reproduce the age-luminosity relation. The distance of 1.25 kpc is found in
very good agreement with recent determination using parallax method. The

the size mismatch and the bond proportion effects combined do not change the

NbSe2. The relevant measurement parameter, the Josephson ICRN product, is
discussed within the context of both BCS superconductors and the high
transition temperature superconductors. The local relationship between the ICRN
product and the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) gap are presented within
the context of phase diagrams for BSCCO. Excessive current densities can be
produced with these measurements and have been found to alter the local DOS in
the BSCCO. Systematic studies of this effect were performed to determine the
practical measurement limits for these experiments. Alternative methods for
preparation of the BSCCO surface are also discussed.

nodes have an infinite amount of data to send and the goal is to optimally
allocate their uplink bandwidths such that the demands of every peer in terms
of receiving data rate are met. We solve this problem through a mapping from a
node-weighted graph featuring two labels per node to a max flow problem on an
edge-weighted bipartite graph. In the second problem under consideration, the
resource allocation is driven by the availability of the data resource that the
peers are interested in sharing. That is a node cannot allocate its uplink
resources unless it has data to transmit first. The problem of uplink bandwidth
allocation is then equivalent to constructing a set of directed trees in the
overlay such that the number of nodes receiving the data is maximized while the
uplink capacities of the peers are not exceeded. We show that the problem is
NP-complete, and provide a linear programming decomposition decoupling it into
a master problem and multiple slave subproblems that can be resolved in
polynomial time. We also design a heuristic algorithm in order to compute a
suboptimal solution in a reasonable time. This algorithm requires only a local
knowledge from nodes, so it should support distributed implementations.
  We analyze both problems through a series of simulation experiments featuring
different network sizes and network densities. On large networks, we compare
our heuristic and its variants with a genetic algorithm and show that our
heuristic computes the better resource allocation. On smaller networks, we
contrast these performances to that of the exact algorithm and show that
resource allocation fulfilling a large part of the peer can be found, even for
hard configuration where no resources are in excess.

larger-scaled than the single nucleotide polymorphisms. Using genotyping
microarray for copy number variation detection has become standard, and there

to the detection of regions with copy number variation/alteration, on samples
taken from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient. Two sets of whole-genome

lossless joint source-channel coding (JSCC), where the joint spectrum is a
variant of the input-output complete weight distribution and is considered good
if it is close to the average joint spectrum of all linear encoders (of the
same coding rate). In spite of their existence, little is known on how to
construct such encoders in practice. This paper is devoted to their
construction. In particular, two families of linear encoders are presented and
proved to have good joint spectra. The first family is derived from Gabidulin
codes, a class of maximum-rank-distance codes. The second family is constructed
using a serial concatenation of an encoder of a low-density parity-check code
(as outer encoder) with a low-density generator matrix encoder (as inner
encoder). In addition, criteria for good linear encoders are defined for three
coding applications: lossless source coding, channel coding, and lossless JSCC.
In the framework of the code-spectrum approach, these three scenarios
correspond to the problems of constructing linear encoders with good kernel
spectra, good image spectra, and good joint spectra, respectively. Good joint
spectra imply both good kernel spectra and good image spectra, and for every
linear encoder having a good kernel (resp., image) spectrum, it is proved that
there exists a linear encoder not only with the same kernel (resp., image) but
also with a good joint spectrum. Thus a good joint spectrum is the most
important feature of a linear encoder.

decay through the SO(10) gauge interactions, if one right-handed (RH) neutrino
(\nu^c_1) is lighter than the LSP and its superpartner (\tilde{\nu}^c_1)
develops a vacuum expectation value (VEV), raising extremely small R-parity
violation naturally. The leptonic decay modes can be dominant, if the VEV scale
of {\bf 16}_H is a few orders of magnitude lower than the VEV of {\bf 45}_H

mediating the LSP decay is superheavy. From PAMELA data, the SU(3)_c x SU(2)_L

between one RH (s)neutrino and the MSSM fields. Even if one RH neutrino is
quite light, the seesaw mechanism providing the extremely light three physical

  Meir has been added",,,,"math.QA math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We apply the yoga of classical homotopy theory to classification problems of
G-extensions of fusion and braided fusion categories, where G is a finite
group. Namely, we reduce such problems to classification (up to homotopy) of
maps from BG to classifiying spaces of certain higher groupoids. In particular,
to every fusion category C we attach the 3-groupoid BrPic(C) of invertible
C-bimodule categories, called the Brauer-Picard groupoid of C, such that
equivalence classes of G-extensions of C are in bijection with homotopy classes
of maps from BG to the classifying space of BrPic(C). This gives rise to an
explicit description of both the obstructions to existence of extensions and
the data parametrizing them; we work these out both topologically and
algebraically.
  One of the central results of the paper is that the 2-truncation of BrPic(C)
is canonically the 2-groupoid of braided autoequivalences of the Drinfeld
center Z(C) of C. In particular, this implies that the Brauer-Picard group
BrPic(C) (i.e., the group of equivalence classes of invertible C-bimodule
categories) is naturally isomorphic to the group of braided autoequivalences of
Z(C). Thus, if C=Vec(A), where A is a finite abelian group, then BrPic(C) is
the orthogonal group O(A+A^*). This allows one to obtain a rather explicit
classification of extensions in this case; in particular, in the case G=Z/2, we
rederive (without computations) the classical result of Tambara and Yamagami.
Moreover, we explicitly describe the category of all (Vec(A1),Vec(A2))-bimodule
categories (not necessarily invertible ones) by showing that it is equivalent
to the hyperbolic part of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.

translating spherical liquid droplet which we perturb by imposing a

have shown in previous work that the rotation not only leads to one or more
three-dimensional chaotic mixing regions, in which mixing occurs through the
stretching and folding of material lines, but also offers the possibility of
controlling both the size and the location of chaotic mixing within the drop.
Such a control was achieved through appropriate tuning of the amplitude and
frequency of the rotation in order to use resonances between the natural
frequencies of the system and those of the external forcing. In this paper, we
study the influence of the orientation of the rotation axis on the chaotic
mixing zones as a third parameter, as well as propose an experimental set up to

rapid growth between a redshift of z=1 and z=0, corresponding to the past 7
billion years of cosmic time. There is thus an expectation that the stellar
masses of the most massive galaxies will also rapidly grow via merging over
this redshift range. While there are examples of massive merging galaxies at
low redshift, recent observations show that the stellar masses of massive
galaxies have grown by only 30% since z=1. Some of the literature claims that
the slow growth of massive galaxies is contrary to the CDM paradigm, although
this is not necessarily the case. To determine why massive galaxies are not
growing rapidly, we have modeled how galaxies populate dark matter halos. To do
this, we have measured the space density and spatial clustering of redshift z<1
galaxies in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. We have then
modeled the observations using the halo occupation distribution (HOD)
formalism. We find that the stellar masses of the largest galaxies are
proportional to dark matter halo mass to the power of a third. In the most
massive dark matter halos, we also find that the stellar mass is distributed
mostly among ""satellite"" galaxies. As a consequence, the stellar masses of
large galaxies are expected to increase relatively slowly, even though they
reside within rapidly growing dark matter halos.

address this issue by designing an unconditionally secure authentication code

pollution attacks from outsiders, as well as coalitions of malicious insiders.
Intermediate nodes can verify the integrity and origin of the packets received
without having to decode, and thus detect and discard the malicious messages

associated to the cluster. We find that three groups contain galaxies at the
cluster redshift and that they are probably bound to the cluster. This is the
first confirmation of filamentary structure as traced by galaxy groups at z>1.
We then use several spectral features in the FORS2 spectra to determine the
star formation histories of group galaxies. We find a population of relatively
red star-forming galaxies in the groups that are absent from the cluster core.
While similarly red star forming galaxies can also be found in the field, the
average strength of the hd line is systematically weaker in group galaxies.
Interestingly, these groups at z=1.2 are in an environment in which the
on-going build-up of red sequence is happening. The unusual line strengths can
be explained by star formation that is heavily obscured by dust. We hypothesize
that galaxy-galaxy interactions, which is more efficient in the group
environment, is the mechanism that drives these dust obscured star formation.
The hypothesis can be tested by obtaining spectral observations in the near-IR,
high resolution imaging observations and observations in the mid-IR.

functor $G:\B\to \A$ between arbitrary categories. We call $G$ a {\em
$\star$-functor} if it has a left adjoint $F:\A\to \B$ such that the unit of
the adjunction is an {\em extremal epimorphism} and the counit is an {\em
extremal monomorphism}. In this case $(F,G)$ is an idempotent pair of functors
and induces an equivalence between the category $\A_{GF}$ of modules for the
monad $GF$ and the category $\B^{FG}$ of comodules for the comonad $FG$.
Moreover, $\B^{FG}=\Fix(FG)$ is closed under factor objects in $\B$,
$\A_{GF}=\Fix(GF)$ is closed under subobjects in $\A$.

environments. Each one is characterized by different conditions that influence
the growth, e.g. relative velocities, composition, and size of the smallest
constituents (monomers). Here we study the microphysics of collisions of dust
aggregates in a four-dimensional parameter space. The parameters are the
collision energy, the initial compactness of agglomerates, the mass ratio of
collision partners, and the impact parameter. For this purpose we employ a
state of the art molecular dynamics type of model that has been extensively and
successfully tested against laboratory experiments. It simulates the motion of
individual monomers interacting dynamically via van der Waals surface forces.
The structure of aggregates is quantified by the filling factor that provides
information about the internal structure, the packing density of monomers, and
the projected surface area of aggregates. Our results show the importance of
the impact parameter that causes formation of elongated particles, due to
tensile forces acting in offset collisions. We also describe in detail the
internal structure of the resulting aggregates.
  Our findings are summarized in the form of a simple collision recipe. The
recipe specifies the outcome of a collision, averaged over the impact
parameter. It is provided in tabular form for a range of physical parameters
such as impact energy and pre-collision filling factor. The dependence on the
mass ratio of impactor and target is taken into account by providing both a
local and a global branch of the recipe.

retrieval tasks that typically involve high dimensional datasets. In order to
reduce the storage space and ensure efficient performance of queries,
dimensionality reduction while preserving the inter-point similarity is highly
desirable. In this paper, we investigate various statistical distance measures
from the point of view of discovering low distortion embeddings into
low-dimensional spaces. More specifically, we consider the Mahalanobis distance
measure, the Bhattacharyya class of divergences and the Kullback-Leibler
divergence. We present a dimensionality reduction method based on the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma for the Mahalanobis measure that achieves
arbitrarily low distortion. By using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma again, we
further demonstrate that the Bhattacharyya distance admits dimensionality
reduction with arbitrarily low additive error. We also examine the question of
embeddability into metric spaces for these distance measures due to the
availability of efficient indexing schemes on metric spaces. We provide
explicit constructions of point sets under the Bhattacharyya and the
Kullback-Leibler divergences whose embeddings into any metric space incur
arbitrarily large distortions. We show that the lower bound presented for
Bhattacharyya distance is nearly tight by providing an embedding that
approaches the lower bound for relatively small dimensional datasets.

information theory and quantum chaos. Moreover, a detailed study of their
properties can shed light on some foundational issues of the quantum
statistical mechanics such as the emergence of well defined thermal properties
from the pure quantum mechanical description of large many body systems. When
dealing with an ensemble of pure quantum states, two questions naturally arise:
what is the probability density function on the parameters which specify the
state of the system in a given ensemble? And, does there exist a most typical
value of a function of interest in the considered ensemble? Here two different
ensembles are considered: the Random Pure State Ensemble (RPSE) and the Fixed
Expectation Energy Ensemble (FEEE). By means of a suitable parameterization of
the wave function in terms of populations and phases, we focus on the
probability distribution of the populations in such ensembles. A comparison is
made between the distribution induced by the inherent geometry of the Hilbert
Space and an approximate distribution derived by means of the minimization of
the informational functional. While the latter can be analytically handled, the
exact geometrical distribution is sampled by a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
The analysis is made for an ensemble of wavefunctions describing an ideal
system composed of n spins 1/2 and reveals the salient differences between the
geometrical and the approximate distributions. The analytical approximations
are proven to be useful tools in order to obtain ensemble averaged quantity. In
particular we focus on the distribution of the Shannon entropy by providing an
explanation of the emergence of a typical value of this quantity in the
ensembles.

of the stellar irradiation, indicated by X-ray emission, on the crystalline
structure of the circumstellar dust. The dust crystallinity is measured for 42
class II T Tauri stars in the Taurus star-forming region using a decomposition
fit of the 10 micron silicate feature, measured with the Spitzer IRS
instrument. Since the sample includes objects with disks of various
evolutionary stages, we further confine the target selection, using the age of
the objects as a selection parameter. We correlate the X-ray luminosity and the
X-ray hardness of the central object with the crystalline mass fraction of the
circumstellar dust and find a significant anti-correlation for 20 objects
within an age range of approx. 1 to 4.5 Myr. We postulate that X-rays represent
the stellar activity and consequently the energetic ions of the stellar winds
which interact with the circumstellar disk. We show that the fluxes around 1 AU
and ion energies of the present solar wind are sufficient to amorphize the
upper layer of dust grains very efficiently, leading to an observable reduction
of the crystalline mass fraction of the circumstellar, sub-micron sized dust.
This effect could also erase other relations between crystallinity and
disk/star parameters such as age or spectral type.

disks is of fundamental importance. Previous studies found that the magnetic
field has a very strong impact on the collapse of a prestellar cloud,
particularly in possibly suppressing the formation of a disk even for
relatively modest values of the magnetic intensity. Since observations infer
that cores have a substantial level of magnetization, this raises the question
of how disks form. However, most studies have been restricted to the case in
which the initial angle, $\alpha$, between the magnetic field and the rotation
axis equals 0$^\circ$. We explore and analyse the influence of non aligned
configurations on disk formation. We perform 3D ideal MHD, AMR numerical
simulations for various values of $\mu$, the ratio of the mass-to-flux to the
critical mass-to-flux, and various values of $\alpha$. We find that disks form
more easily as $\alpha$ increases from 0 to 90$^\circ$. We propose that as the
magnetized pseudo-disks become thicker with increasing $\alpha$, the magnetic
braking efficiency is lowered. We also find that even small values of $\alpha$
($\simeq$ 10-20$^\circ$) show significant differences with the alligned case.
Within the framework of ideal MHD and for our choice of initial conditions,
centrifugally supported disks cannot form for values of $\mu$ smaller than
$\simeq$3, if the magnetic field and the rotation axis are perpendicular, and
smaller than about $\simeq$5-10 when they are perfectly aligned.

a sink site, the diameter of the pattern grows as $\sqrt{(N/\log N)}$ for large

a line of sink sites, this rate reduces to $N^{1/3}$. We determine the growth
rates for these sink geometries along with the case when there are two lines of
sink sites forming a wedge, and its generalization to higher dimensions. We
characterize one such asymptotic patterns on the two-dimensional F-lattice with

and from meta-stable levels. Here, we apply this to two lines from adjacent
ionization stages; Mg IX 368A and Mg X 625A, which has been shown to be a very
useful temperature diagnostic. At densities typical of coronal hole conditions,
the difference between the electron temperature derived assuming the zero
density limit compared with the electron density dependent
ionization/recombination is small. This however is not the case for flares
where the electron density is orders of magnitude larger. The derived

delayed feedback is presented. We are motivated by recent research on
stochastic effects in models of transcriptional gene regulation. We start from
the normal form for a pitchfork bifurcation, and add multiplicative or
parametric noise and linear delayed feedback. The latter is sufficient to
originate a Hopf bifurcation in that region of parameters in which there is a
sufficiently strong negative feedback. We find a sharp bifurcation in parameter
space, and define the threshold as the point in which the stationary
distribution function p(x) changes from a delta function at the trivial state
x=0 to p(x) ~ x^alpha at small x (with alpha = -1 exactly at threshold). We
find that the bifurcation threshold is shifted by fluctuations relative to the
deterministic limit by an amount that scales linearly with the noise intensity.
Analytic calculations of the bifurcation threshold are also presented in the
limit of small delay tau -> 0 that compare quite favorably with the numerical
solutions even for tau = 1.

magnetic polarity opposite to the main sunspot polarity. They may be a direct
confirmation of magnetic field lines and mass flows returning to the solar
interior throughout the penumbra, a configuration previously inferred from
interpretation of observed Stokes profile asymmetries. The paper points out the
relationship between the reverse polarity features found by Hinode, and the
model Micro-Structured Magnetic Atmospheres (MISMAs) proposed for sunspots. We
show how the existing model MISMAs produce strongly redshifted reverse polarity
structures as found by Hinode. Ad hoc model MISMAs also explain the asymmetric
Stokes profiles observed by Hinode. The same modeling may be consistent with
magnetograms of dark cored penumbral filaments if the dark cores are associated
with the reverse polarity. Such hypothetical relationship will show up only in
the far red wings of the spectral lines.

plasmonic waveguide can be arbitrary. We apply our numerical method to
calculate the coupling of a quantum emitter to a cylindrical nanowire and a
rectangular waveguide, and compare the cylindrical nanowire to previous work
valid in quasistatic approximation. The fraction of the energy coupled to the
plasmonic mode can be calculated exactly, which can be used to determine the
single optical plasmon generation efficiency for a quantum emitter. For a gold
nanowire we observe agreement with the quasistatic approximation for radii
below 20 nm, but for larger radii the total decay rate is up to 10 times
larger. For the rectangular waveguide we estimate an optimized value for the

after Ge+ ion implantation but before annealing, with randomly distributed Ge
atoms within the struggle layer. The 3rd - samples after formation of Ge

  It is shown that in ""initial"" samples, the C-V characteristics have a
step-like form of ""S-shape"", which is typical for MOS structures in the case of
high frequency. However, in ""implanted"" and ""NC-Ge"" samples, C-V
characteristics have ""U-shape"" despite the high frequency operation, In
addition, ""NC-Ge"" samples exhibit a large hysteresis which may indicate charge
trapping at the NC-Ge. Combination of the ""U-shape"" and hysteresis

boundaries of the mixed phase and the related critical points for symmetric and
asymmetric matter are obtained. Due to the different symmetry term in the two
phases, isospin effects appear to be rather significant. With increasing
isospin asymmetry the binodal transition line of the (T,\rho_B) diagram is
lowered to a region accessible through heavy ion collisions in the energy range
of the new planned facilities, e.g. the FAIR/NICA projects. Some observable

more isospin asymmetric quark phase, to be seen in charged meson yield ratios,
and an onset of quark number scaling of the meson/baryon elliptic flows. The
presented isospin effects on the mixed phase appear to be robust with respect
to even large variations of the poorly known symmetry term at high baryon
density in the hadron phase. The dependence of the results on a suitable
treatment of isospin contributions in effective QCD Lagrangian approaches, at

drives clustering, while a weak, long-ranged repulsion is used to model
electrostatic charging in experimental systems. The former is treated with a

interaction. We consider the yield of clusters of specific structure as a
function of the strength of the interactions, for clusters with m=3,4,5,6,7,10
and 13 colloids. At sufficient strengths of the attractive interaction (around
10 kT), the average bond lifetime approaches the simulation timescale and the
system becomes nonergodic. For small clusters m<=5 where geometric frustration
is not relevant, despite nonergodicity, for sufficient strengths of the
attractive interaction the yield of clusters which maximise the number of bonds
approaches 100%. However for $m=7$ and higher, in the nonergodic regime we find
a lower yield of these structures where we argue geometric frustration plays a
significant role. $m=6$ is a special case, where two structures, of octahedral
and C2v symmetry compete, with the latter being favoured by entropic
contributions in the ergodic regime and by kinetic trapping in the nonergodic
regime. We believe that our results should be valid as far as the one-component
description of the interaction potential is valid. A system with competing
electrostatic repulsions and van der Waals attractions may be such an example.
However, in some cases, the one-component description of the interaction

transits of the planetary companion CoRoT-2b, we adopt a `strip' model of the
surface to reproduce the photometric modulation inside and outside the transits
simultaneously. Our reconstructions show that it is possible to achieve
appropriate fits for the entire sub-interval using a low-resolution surface
model with 36 strips. The surface reconstructions indicate that the brightness
on the eclipsed section of the stellar surface is (6 +/- 1) % lower than the
average brightness of the remaining surface. This result suggests a
concentration of stellar activity in a band around the stellar equator similar
to the behavior observed on the Sun.

that optical paths are completely analogous to mechanical trajectories. We
follow Schr\""{o}dinger's original idea and go beyond this analogy by changing
over from the Hamilton's principal function $S$ to the wave function $\Psi$. We
thus travel from classical to quantum mechanics through optics.

there is a natural coaction $\delta$ of $G$ on the Fell-bundle $C^*$-algebra
$C^*(G,\AA)$ such that if $\hat{\delta}$ is the dual action of $G$ on the
crossed product $C^*(G,\AA) \rtimes_{\delta} G$, then the full crossed product
$(C^*(G,\AA) \rtimes_{\delta}G)\rtimes_{\hat{\delta}}G$ is canonically
isomorphic to $C^*(G,\AA) \otimes\KK(L^2(G))$. Hence the coaction $\delta$ is
maximal.

the standard model (SM). Possibilities include TeV-scale bosons with
electroweak coupling, very light bosons which nearly decouple from the standard
model particles, and bosons which communicate with a quasi-hidden sector. A
broad survey is given of the theoretical possibilities and of the physics
implications for particle physics and cosmology. Several novel examples,
including light Z's suggested by PAMELA, Stueckelberg Z's, and Z's associated
with the mediation of supersymmetry breaking, are described.
