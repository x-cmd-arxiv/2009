probability ""1 - \alpha"" to move in a random direction until it lands back on
the lattice at a fixed distance L away from the departure point. Considering

demonstrate that, in general, such optimal intermittent strategies are much

addition, such intermittent strategies appear to be more advantageous than
Levy-based ones in that they lead to more thorough exploration of visited

Furthermore, the masses of the fissioning species were measured and interpreted

that mass measurement is considered by the Transfermium Working Group (TWG)

their refusal to accept the possibility of the existence of long-lived isomeric
states as a consistent interpretation of the data is unjustified, since, among
other observations, evidence has been found recently for the existence of such
states in naturally-occurring neutron deficient 211,213,217,218Th isotopes, and

is a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of a galactic scale
gravitational wave observatory sensitive to gravitational waves in the

involving similar organizations of European and Australian astronomers who
share the same goal. Gravitational waves, a prediction of Einstein's general
theory of relativity, are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by the
bulk motion of matter, and the dynamics of space-time itself. They are
detectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time between
some light source and an observer. NANOGrav exploits radio pulsars as both the
light (radio) source and the clock against which the light travel time is
measured. In an array of radio pulsars gravitational waves manifest themselves
as correlated disturbances in the pulse arrival times. The timing precision of
today's best measured pulsars is less than 100 ns. With improved
instrumentation and signal-to-noise it is widely believed that the next decade
could see a pulsar timing network of 100 pulsars each with better than 100 ns
timing precision. Such a pulsar timing array (PTA), observed with a regular
cadence of days to weeks, would be capable of observing supermassive black hole
binaries following galactic mergers, relic radiation from early universe
phenomena such as cosmic strings, cosmic superstrings, or inflation, and more
generally providing a vantage on the universe whose revolutionary potential has
not been seen in the 400 years since Galileo first turned a telescope to the

effect with the fissioning system is found to be only a partial aspect of the
even-odd structure. Indeed, it is shown that the global even-odd effect is
varying systematically with the mean asymmetry of the fission-fragment

asymmetry is depending on the fissioning system. Thus, the dependency of the
even-odd effect with the fissioning system is accredited in part to the
asymmetry evolution of the charge distribution, and not solely related to the
dissipated energy as it has been done earlier. This interpretation is strongly
supported by data measured in inverse kinematics, which cover the complete

the order parameter to describe the even-odd effect in fission-fragment yields

first-order theories of special and general relativity, while Szekely's PhD
dissertation focuses on an intermediate logic of accelerated observers. In this
paper we will attempt to incorporate a model of quantum theoretical
trajectories that can reasonably claim to be physically meaningful into those
theories.
  We have recently shown that a model of quantum trajectories, based on
discrete finitary motion, is logically equivalent to Feynman's path-integral
formulation when spacetime is assumed to be Euclidean. In this paper we argue
that relativistic observers are subject to the same quantum illusions as in the
Euclidean case: even though motion is discrete and respects no built-in 'arrow
of time', observers have no choice but to perceive particle trajectories as
continuous paths in spacetime.
  Whereas the relativistic theories presuppose continuous paths as part of
their axioms, the illusion of continuity allows us to replace this axiom with a
lower-level quantum-inspired axiom concerning discrete jumps in spacetime. We
investigate the nature of these jumps, and how far they can be tied to the
underlying geometric structure of spacetime. In particular, we consider hops
which preserve features of the underlying number field, and investigate the
extent to which all hops can be restricted to be of this form.
  We conclude that hop-based motion can also be regarded as an illusion, one
caused by modelling physics in the 'wrong' number system.

positive parameters. The geometric measure of entanglement as a function of
state parameters can have different expressions. Each of expressions has its
own applicable domain and thus the whole state parameter space is divided into
subspaces that are ranges of definition for corresponding expressions. The
purpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general
qubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the
eigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable
states for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.
Next, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of
all subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states. It
is shown that there are three applicable domains when the phase factor is
$\pi/2$ while other cases have only two domains. The emergence of the three
domains is due to the appearance of the additional W-state. We show that most
of highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains and states
located far from the boundaries become less-entangled and eventually go to the
product states. The neighbors of W-state are generally more entangled than the
neighbors of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state from the aspect of the
geometric measure. However, the range of the GHZ-neighbors is much more wider

Eddington ratio and the SSFR suggested by Chen et al., although a larger
scatter in their relation. We also suggest that about 7.0% of the total \ha

arbitrary function of the curvature invariants, on the brane. In general, the
formulation of the junction conditions (except for Euler characteristics such
as Gauss-Bonnet term) leads to the powers of the delta function and requires
regularization. We suggest the way to avoid such a problem by imposing the
metric and its first derivative to be regular at the brane, the second
derivative to have a kink, the third derivative of the metric to have a step
function discontinuity, and no sooner as the fourth derivative of the metric to
give the delta function contribution to the field equations. Alternatively, we
discuss the reduction of the fourth-order gravity to the second order theory by
introducing extra scalar and tensor fields: the scalaron and the tensoron. In
order to obtain junction conditions we apply two methods: the application of
the Gauss-Codazzi formalism and the application of the generalized
Gibbons-Hawking boundary terms which are appended to the appropriate actions.
In the most general case we derive junction conditions without assuming the
continuity of the scalaron and the tensoron on the brane. The derived junction
conditions can serve studying the cosmological implications of the higher-order
brane gravity models.

galaxies and quasars at z=4,5,6. These fields were previously found to contain
overdensities of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) or spectroscopic Lyman alpha
emitters. We use HST and Spitzer data to infer stellar masses, and contrast our
results with large samples of LBGs in more average environments as probed by
the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS). The following results were
obtained. First, LBGs in both overdense regions and in the field at z=4-5 lie
on a very similar sequence in a z'-[3.6] versus [3.6] color-magnitude diagram.
This is interpreted as a sequence in stellar mass (log[M*/Msun] = 9-11) in
which galaxies become increasingly red due to dust and age as their star
formation rate (SFR) increases. Second, the two radio galaxies are among the
most massive objects (log[M*/Msun]~11) known to exist at z~4-5, and are
extremely rare based on the low number density of such objects as estimated
from the ~25x larger area GOODS survey. We suggest that the presence of these
massive galaxies and supermassive black holes has been boosted through rapid
accretion of gas or merging inside overdense regions. Third, the total stellar
mass found in the z=4 ``proto-cluster'' TN1338 accounts for <30% of the stellar
mass on the cluster red sequence expected to have formed at z>4, based on a
comparison with the massive X-ray cluster Cl1252 at z=1.2. Although future
near-infrared observations should determine whether any massive galaxies are
currently being missed, one possible explanation for this mass difference is
that TN1338 evolves into a smaller cluster than Cl1252. This raises the
interesting question of whether the most massive protocluster regions at z>4
remain yet to be discovered.

  In this paper, we study this convex hull, and more precisely its extremal
points, if $\psi$ is a stochastic process. The times where those extremal
points are reached, called extremal times, form a negligible set for L\'evy
processes, their integrated processes, and It\^o processes. We examine more
closely the case of a L\'evy process with bounded variation. Its extremal
points are almost surely countable, with accumulation only around the extremal
values. These results are derived from the general study of the extremal times
of $\psi+f$, where $\psi$ is a L\'evy process and $f$ a smooth deterministic
drift.
  These results allow us to show that, for an inviscid Burgers turbulence with
a compactly supported initial potential $\psi$, the only point capable of being
Lagrangian regular is the time $T$ where $\psi$ reaches its maximum, and that
is indeed a regular point iff 0 is regular for both half-lines. As a
consequence, if the turbulence occurs on a non-compact interval, there are a.s.
no Lagrangian regular points.

the probability that the pair of the origin is at distance greater than $r$
decay as fast as possible. For two dimensions, we give a matching of decay
$cr^{1/2}$, which is optimal. For dimension at least 3 we give a matching rule
that has an exponential tail. This substantially improves previous bounds. The
construction has two major parts: first we define a sequence of coarser and
coarser partitions of $\Z^d$ in an equivariant way, such that with high
probability the cell of a fixed point is like a cube, and the labels in it are
i.i.d. Then we define a matching for a fixed finite cell, which stabilizes as

also work in the case when one wants to match points of two Poisson processes,
