  Settling a Conjecture by Weingarten et. al",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the degrees of freedom (DoF) of three classes of finite state
compound wireless networks in this paper. First, we study the multiple-input
single-output (MISO) finite state compound broadcast channel (BC) with
arbitrary number of users and antennas at the transmitter. In prior work,
Weingarten et. al. have found inner and outer bounds on the DoF with 2 users.
The bounds have a different character. While the inner bound collapses to unity
as the number of states increases, the outer bound does not diminish with the
increasing number of states beyond a threshold value. It has been conjectured
that the outer bound is loose and the inner bound represents the actual DoF. In
the complex setting (all signals, noise, and channel coefficients are complex
variables) we solve a few cases to find that the outer bound -and not the inner
bound- of Weingarten et. al. is tight. For the real setting (all signals, noise
and channel coefficients are real variables) we completely characterize the
DoF, once again proving that the outer bound of Weingarten et. al. is tight. We
also extend the results to arbitrary number of users. Second, we characterize
the DoF of finite state scalar (single antenna nodes) compound X networks with
arbitrary number of users in the real setting. Third, we characterize the DoF
of finite state scalar compound interference networks with arbitrary number of
users in both the real and complex setting. The key finding is that scalar
interference networks and (real) X networks do not lose any DoF due to channel
uncertainty at the transmitter in the finite state compound setting. The finite
state compound MISO BC does lose DoF relative to the perfect CSIT scenario.
However, what is lost is only the DoF benefit of joint processing at transmit
antennas, without which the MISO BC reduces to an X network.

of unknown, finite alphabet, stationary sources in a clas M of sources with
vanishing memory (e.g. stationary Markov sources).
  The task of a universal classifier is to decide whether the two sequences are
emerging from the same source or are emerging from two distinct sources in M,
and it has to carry this task without any prior knowledge of the two underlying
probability measures.
  Given a fidelity function and a fidelity criterion, the probability of
classification error for a given universal classifier is defined.
  Two universal classifiers are defined for pairs of $N$ -sequence: A
""classical"" fixed-length (FL) universal classifier and an alternative
variable-length (VL) universal classifier.
  Following Wyner and Ziv (1996) it is demonstrated that if the length of the
individual sequences N is smaller than a cut-off value that is determined by
the properties of the class M, any universal classifier will fail with high
probability .
  It is demonstrated that for values of N larger than the cut-off rate, the
classification error relative to either one of the two classifiers tends to
zero as the length of the sequences tends to infinity.
  However, the probability of classification error that is associated with the
variable-length universal classifier is uniformly smaller (or equal) to the one
that is associated with the ""classical"" fixed-length universal classifier, for
any finite length.

episode of SF activity concentrated at the earliest epochs, whilst many others
show extended or recurrent SF activity; 3) No galaxy experiencing now its first

find that the thermal conductivity due to phonons is \kappa^P =1.04 10^{26}

m_{10} is the kaon mass in units of 10 MeV. These values are smaller than
previous estimates, but still much larger than (in the case of phonons) or
similar to (for kaons) the corresponding values in nuclear matter. From the

consider how photon yield per electron can be increased, and hence fast
electron beam intensity requirements reduced, by local re-acceleration of fast
electrons throughout the HXR source itself, after injection.} {We show
parametrically that, if net re-acceleration rates due to e.g. waves or local
current sheet electric (${\cal E}$) fields are a significant fraction of
collisional loss rates, electron lifetimes, and hence the net radiative HXR

requirements and anisotropy are thus reduced. One specific possible scenario
involving such re-acceleration is discussed, viz, a current sheet cascade (CSC)
in a randomly stressed magnetic loop.} {Combined MHD and test particle
simulations show that local ${\cal E}$ fields in CSCs can efficiently
accelerate electrons in the corona and and re-accelerate them after injection
into the chromosphere. In this HXR source scenario, rapid synchronisation and
variability of impulsive footpoint emissions can still occur since primary
electron acceleration is in the high Alfv\'{e}n speed corona with fast

centers of galactic bulges, and the discovery of relations between the SMBH
mass (M) and the properties of these bulges, has been fundamental in directing
our understanding of both galaxy and SMBH formation and evolution. However,
there are still many questions surrounding the SMBH - galaxy relations. For
example, are the scaling relations linear and constant throughout cosmic
history, and do all SMBHs lie on the scaling relations? These questions can
only be answered by further high quality direct M estimates from a wide range
in redshift. In this paper we determine the observational requirements
necessary to directly determine SMBH masses, across cosmological distances,
using current M modeling techniques. We also discuss the SMBH detection
abilities of future facilities. We find that if different M modeling
techniques, using different spectral features, can be shown to be consistent,
then both 30 m ground- and 16 m space-based telescopes will be able to sample M
1e9Msol across ~95% of cosmic history. However, we find that the abilities of
ground-based telescopes critically depend on future advancements in adaptive
optics systems; more limited AO systems will result in limited effective
spatial resolutions, and forces observations towards the near-infrared where
spectral features are weaker and more susceptible to sky features. Ground-based
AO systems will always be constrained by relatively bright sky backgrounds and
atmospheric transmission. The latter forces the use of multiple spectral
features and dramatically impacts the SMBH detection efficiency. The most
efficient way to advance our database of direct SMBH masses is therefore
through the use of a large (16 m) space-based UVOIR telescope.

due to both Rashba (with strength $\alpha)$ and Dresselhaus (with strength
$\beta)$ spin-orbit interaction. Using a diffusion equation approach we find
that magnetoelectric effects disappear and that there is thus no spin
accumulation when both interactions have the same strength, $\alpha=\pm \beta$.
In thermodynamically large systems, the finite spin accumulation predicted by
Chaplik, Entin and Magarill, [Physica E {\bf 13}, 744 (2002)] and by Trushin
and Schliemann [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 75}, 155323 (2007)] is recovered an
infinitesimally small distance away from the singular point $\alpha=\pm \beta$.
We show however that the singularity is broadened and that the suppression of
spin accumulation becomes physically relevant (i) in finite-sized systems of
size $L$, (ii) in the presence of a cubic Dresselhaus interaction of strength
$\gamma$, or (iii) for finite frequency measurements. We obtain the parametric
range over which the magnetoelectric effect is suppressed in these three
instances as (i) $|\alpha|-|\beta| \lesssim 1/mL$, (ii)$|\alpha|-|\beta|
\lesssim \gamma p_{\rm F}^2$, and (iii) $|\alpha|-|\beta| \lesssiM
\sqrt{\omega/m p_{\rm F}\ell}$ with $\ell$ the elastic mean free path and
$p_{\rm F}$ the Fermi momentum. We attribute the absence of spin accumulation
close to $\alpha=\pm \beta$ to the underlying U (1) symmetry. We illustrate and
confirm our predictions numerically.

rotation axis and the circumstellar disc axis of a star that forms in a stellar
cluster from the collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud. This is an inherently
chaotic environment with variable accretion, both in terms of rate and the
angular momentum of the material, and dynamical interactions between stars. We
find that the final stellar rotation axis and disc spin axis can be strongly
misaligned, but this occurs primarily when the disc is truncated by a dynamical
encounter so that the final disc rotation axis depends simply on what fell in
last. This may lead to planetary systems with orbits that are misaligned with
the stellar rotation axis, but only if the final disc contains enough mass to
form planets. We also investigate the time variability of the inner disc spin
axis, which is likely to determine the direction of a protostellar jet. We find
that the jet direction varies more strongly for lighter discs, such as those
that have been truncated by dynamical interactions or have suffered a period of
rapid accretion. Finally, we note that variability of the angular momentum of
the material accreting by a star implies that the internal velocity field of

The algorithm is distributed, thus allowing parallel implementation suitable
for computations on multiple machines without significant inter-machine
overhead. We test our method on the model example of particle tracking in
turbulent flows, which is particularly challenging due to the strong transport
that those flows produce. Our numerical experiments show that the BP algorithm
compares in quality with exact Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithms, yet BP is
far superior in speed. We also suggest and analyze a random-distance model that

large-scale applications, the methods described also require large memory sets

work, we modify the algorithm to allow the computation of large-scale problems.
We reduce the memory footprint via a domain decomposition. By introducing
iterative Gauss-Seidel type solvers, we improve the speed of the overall
computation. Because of the domain decomposition, the new algorithm requires
the use of parallel-computing systems. The algorithm that we present permits
large-scale solutions of radiative-transfer problems that include arbitrary
wavelength couplings. In addition, we discover a quasi-analytic formal solution
of the radiative transfer that significantly improves the overall computation
speed. More importantly, this method ensures that our algorithm can be applied
to multi-dimensional Lagrangian radiative-transfer calculations. In
multi-dimensional atmospheres, velocity fields are in general chaotic ensuring
that the inclusion of arbitrary wavelength couplings are mandatory.

in these system. Measuring the rate of apsidal motion allows one to estimate
the apsidal motion constant of the mass losing companion star and hence allows
for the direct testing of the stellar structure models for these giant stars

bright persistent sources, namely Cen X-3 and SMC X-1, to measure the very
small orbital eccentricity and the angle of periastron. We find that the small
variations in the pulse profiles of these sources rather than the intrinsic
timing accuracy provided by RXTE, limit the accuracy with which we can measure
arrival time of the pulses from these sources. This influences the accuracy
with which one can measure the orbital parameters, especially the very small

structure and function of complex systems. One remarkable result is the absence
of an epidemic threshold in infinite-size scale-free networks, which implies
that any infection will perpetually propagate regardless of the spreading rate.
The vast majority of current theoretical approaches assumes that infections are
transmitted as a reaction process from nodes to all neighbors. Here we adopt a
different perspective and show that the epidemic incidence is shaped by traffic
flow conditions. Specifically, we consider the scenario in which epidemic
pathways are defined and driven by flows. Through extensive numerical
simulations and theoretical predictions, it is shown that the value of the
epidemic threshold in scale-free networks depends directly on flow conditions,
in particular on the first and second moments of the betweenness distribution
given a routing protocol. We consider the scenarios in which the delivery
capability of the nodes is bounded or unbounded. In both cases, the threshold
values depend on the traffic and decrease as flow increases. Bounded delivery
provokes the emergence of congestion, slowing down the spreading of the disease
and setting a limit for the epidemic incidence. Our results provide a general
conceptual framework to understand spreading processes on complex networks.

are all smaller than previously derived from spectroscopic analyses of the

temperatures permit estimates of PNNi radii, through both the Stefan-Boltzmann

models provides mass estimates. Masses cluster around 0.57 M(sun), close to the
peak of the white dwarf mass distribution. Adding a few more PNNi with
well-determined distances and masses, we compare all the PNNi with cooler white
dwarfs of similar mass, and confirm, as expected, that PNNi have larger radii
than white dwarfs that have reached their final cooling tracks. (Abridged)

has been dubbed ""bimodality"". Using Quantum Molecular Dynamics calculations we
demonstrate that this observation is very general. It appears in collisions of
all symmetric systems larger than Ca and at beam energies between 50 A.MeV and
600 A.MeV and is due to large fluctuations of the impact parameter for a given

the behavior expected from a system in statistical equilibrium, in experiment

(V446 Her) showed drastic changes in the variability across eruptions, and that
all but one of the novae (excepting BT Mon) have the same quiescent magnitudes
before and after the outburst. This work has not been tested since it came out.
We have now tested these results by going back to the original archival
photographic plates and measuring large numbers of pre-eruption magnitudes for
many novae using comparison stars on a modern magnitude scale. We find in
particular that four out of five claimed pre-eruption rises are due to simple
mistakes in the old literature, that V446 Her has the same amplitude of
variations across its 1960 eruption, and that BT Mon has essentially unchanged
brightness across its 1939 eruption. Out of 22 nova eruptions, we find two
confirmed cases of significant pre-eruption rises (for V533 Her and V1500 Cyg),
while T CrB has a deep pre-eruption dip. These events are a challenge to
theorists. We find no significant cases of changes in variability across 27
nova eruptions beyond what is expected due to the usual fluctuations seen in
novae away from eruptions. For 30 classical novae plus 19 eruptions from 6
recurrent novae, we find that the average change in magnitude from before the

separations of the order of a pixel size, suggesting some residual point source
contribution. When restricting our analyses to multipoles $\el \gt $60, we fail
to find any evidence for cross correlation in the range $\el \in [2,10]$, where
according to the model predictions and our simulations $\sim$ 50% of the S/N is
supposed to arise. Also, the accumulated S/N for $\el \lt $60 is below 1, far
from the theoretical expectation of S/N$\sim 5$. Part of this disagreement may
be caused by an inaccurate modeling of the NVSS source population: as in
previous works, we find a level of large scale ($\el \lt $70) clustering in the
NVSS catalog that seems incompatible with a high redshift population. This is
unlikely to be caused by contaminants or systematics, since it is independent
of flux threshold, and hence present for the brightest ($\gt 30 \sigma$) NVSS
sources. Either our NVSS catalogs are not probing the high redshift, large
scale gravitational potential wells, or there is a clear mismatch between the
ISW component present in WMAP data and theoretical expectations.

(ccSN) progenitors are members of a stellar binary at the time of the
explosion. Independent of any consequences of mass transfer, this has
observational consequences that can be used to study the binary properties of
massive stars. In particular, the secondary companion to the progenitor of a
Type Ib/c SN is frequently (~50%) the more optically luminous star since the
high effective temperatures of the stripped progenitors make it relatively easy
for a lower luminosity, cooler secondary to emit more optical light.
Secondaries to the lower mass progenitors of Type II SN will frequently produce
excess blue emission relative to the spectral energy distribution of the red
primary. Available data constrain the models weakly. Any detected secondaries
also provide an independent lower bound on the progenitor mass and, for
historical SN, show that it was not a Type Ia event. Bright ccSN secondaries
have an unambiguous, post-explosion observational signature - strong,
blue-shifted, relatively broad absorption lines created by the developing
supernova remnant. These can be used to locate historical SN with bright
secondaries, confirm that a source is a secondary, and, potentially, measure
abundances of ccSN ejecta. Luminous, hot secondaries will reionize the SNR on
time scales of 100-1000 yrs that are faster than reionization by the reverse
shock, creating peculiar HII regions due to the high metallicity and velocities
of the ejecta.

stars and the process of galaxy formation. A previous study of stacked SDSS
images of disk galaxies has revealed a halo with an abnormally red r-i colour,
seemingly inconsistent with our current understanding of stellar halos. Here,
we investigate the statistical properties of the faint envelopes of low surface
brightness disk galaxies to look for further support for a red excess. 1510
edge-on low surface brightness galaxies were selected from the SDSS Data
Release 5, rescaled to the same apparent size, aligned and stacked. This
procedure allows us to reach a surface brightness of mu_g ~ 31 mag arcsec^-2.
After a careful assessment of instrumental light scattering effects, we derive
median and average radial surface brightness and colour profiles in g,r and i.
The sample is then divided into 3 subsamples according to g-r colour. All three
samples exhibit a red colour excess in r-i in the thick disk/halo region. The
halo colours of the full sample, g-r = 0.60+-0.15 and r-i = 0.80+-0.15, are
found to be incompatible with the colours of any normal type of stellar
population. The fact that no similar colour anomaly is seen at comparable
surface brightness levels along the disk rules out a sky subtraction residual
as the source of the extreme colours. A number of possible explanations for
these abnormally red halos are discussed. We find that two different scenarios
-- dust extinction of extragalactic background light and a stellar population
with a very bottom-heavy initial mass function -- appear to be broadly
consistent with our observations and with similar red excesses reported in the
halos of other types of galaxies.

Through a Bayesian analysis we determine the expectation values (mu_0) and
confidence levels of the underlying number counts for a range of apertures and

that our control samples are not consistent, with the number counts in the
COSMOS sample being significantly higher than in the pure parallel sample for
21 <= F814W <= 23. This result matches those found in previous analyses of
COSMOS data using different techniques. (ii) We find that small-size apertures,
centered on strong lenses, are overdense compared with randomly placed
apertures in the control samples, even compared to the COSMOS sample.
Correcting for the local clustering of elliptical galaxies, based on the
average two-point correlation function reduces this overdensity to the 1-2
sigma level. Thus, the overdensity of galaxies seen along a typical line of
sight to a lens can be explained mostly by the natural clustering of galaxies,
rather than being due to lenses lying along otherwise biased lines of sight.
However, a larger sample of lenses is needed to see if the remaining bias
persists when the lens-field uncertainties are smaller. (iii) There is
considerable scatter in the lines of sight to _individual_ lens systems, but
quantities that are linearly dependent on the external convergence (e.g., H_0)
should become unbiased if the extra galaxies that cause the bias can be
accounted for in the lens models either through direct modeling or via an
informed prior on the external convergence. The number counts can used to set

the dependence of clustering on the shape of the velocity ellipsoid coincides

sources in the 24mic observations of the COSMOS field at S24>~80muJy. Using
accurate photo-z's and extrapolations of the counts at faint fluxes we resolve
with unprecedented detail the build-up of the mid-IR background across cosmic
ages. We find that ~50% and ~80% of the 24mic background intensity originate
from galaxies at z<~1 and z<~2 respectively, supporting the scenario where
highly obscured sources at very high redshifts (z>~2) contribute only
marginally to the CIB. Assuming flux-limited selections at optical wavelengths,
we also find that the fraction of i-band sources with 24mic detection strongly
increases up to z~2 as a consequence of the rapid evolution that star-forming
galaxies have undergone with lookback time. Nonetheless this rising trend shows
a clear break at z~1.3, probably due to k-correction effects implied by the
complexity of SEDs in the mid-IR. Finally, we compare our results with the
predictions from different models of galaxy formation. We note that
semi-analytical formalisms fail to reproduce the redshift distributions
observed at 24mic. Furthermore the simulated galaxies exhibit R-K colors much
bluer than observed and the predicted K-band fluxes are systematically
underestimated at z>0.5. Unless these discrepancies result from an incorrect
treatment of extinction they may reflect an underestimate of the predicted
density of high-z massive sources with strong star formation, which would point
to more fundamental processes that are still not fully controlled in the
simulations. The most recent backward evolution scenarios reproduce reasonably
well the flux/redshift distribution of 24mic sources up to z~3, although none

However, to date there have been no attempts to use simulations of star cluster
formation to investigate how the kinematics of young stars change in response
to variations in the properties of their parent molecular clouds. In this
letter we report the results of turbulent self-gravitating simulations of
cluster formation in which we consider both clouds in virial balance and those
undergoing global collapse. We find that stars in these simulations generally
have velocity dispersions smaller than that of the gas by a factor of ~ 5,
independent of the dynamical state of the parent cloud, so that subvirial
stellar velocity dispersions arise naturally even in virialized molecular
clouds. The simulated clusters also show large-scale stellar velocity gradients
of ~0.2-2 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$ and strong correlations between the centroid
velocities of stars and gas, both of which are observed in young clusters. We
conclude that star clusters should display subvirial velocity dispersions,
large-scale velocity gradients, and strong gas-star velocity correlations
regardless of whether their parent clouds are in virial balance, and,
conversely, that observations of these features cannot be used to infer the
dynamical state of the parent gas clouds.

Millennium simulations give a precise halo mass function for all halos within
which galaxies can form. Under the plausible hypothesis that the stellar mass
of a galaxy is an increasing function of the maximum mass ever attained by its
halo, these combine to give halo mass as a function of stellar mass. The result
agrees quite well with observational estimates of mean halo mass as a function
of stellar mass from stacking analyses of the gravitational lensing signal and
the satellite dynamics of SDSS galaxies. For M_* ~ 5.5 x 10^10 M_sun, the
stellar mass usually assumed for the Milky Way, the implied halo mass is ~ 2 x
10^12 M_sun, consistent with most recent direct estimates and inferences from
the MW/M31 Timing Argument. The fraction of the baryons associated with each
halo which are present as stars in its central galaxy reaches a maximum of 20%
at masses somewhat below that of the Milky Way, and falls rapidly at both
higher and lower masses. These conversion efficiencies are lower than in almost
all recent high-resolution simulations of galaxy formation, showing that these
are not yet viable models for the formation of typical members of the galaxy
population. When inserted in the Millennium-II Simulation, our derived relation
between stellar mass and halo mass predicts a stellar mass autocorrelation
function in excellent agreement with that measured directly in the SDSS. The
implied Tully-Fisher relation also appears consistent with observation,
suggesting that galaxy luminosity functions and Tully-Fisher relations can be

of the secondary star is 10% larger than predicted by models, however,
correcting for irradiation accounts for most of this inconsistency, hence the
secondary star in NN Ser is one of the first precisely measured very low mass

protoplanetary disc irradiated with an X-EUV spectrum. In a model where the
total ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity,
we find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4e-8 M_sun/yr, which is two orders of
magnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus it is clear
that the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This
can be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger
columns (~1e22 cm^-2) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at
larger radius than the EUV can. The radial extent of the launching region of
the X-ray heated wind is 1-70AU compared with the pure EUV case where the
launch region is concentrated around a few AU. When we couple our wind
mass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as
in the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner
hole develops at ~ 1 AU at the point that the accretion rate in the disc drops
below the wind mass loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is
quickly removed in the final 15-20% of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent
with the 1e5 yr transitional timescale estimated from observations of T-Tauri
stars. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to
some accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large
X-ray luminosity of 2e30 erg/s; further modeling is required in order to
investigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray
luminosities in T-Tauri stars.

extensively studied methods for sampling the Ising model on lattices. It is
well known that at high temperatures, the time it takes this chain to mix in
$L^1$ on a system of size $n$ is $O(\log n)$. Whether in this regime there is
cutoff, i.e. a sharp transition in the $L^1$-convergence to equilibrium, is a
fundamental open problem: If so, as conjectured by Peres, it would imply that
mixing occurs abruptly at $(c+o(1))\log n$ for some fixed $c>0$, thus providing
a rigorous stopping rule for this MCMC sampler. However, obtaining the precise
asymptotics of the mixing and proving cutoff can be extremely challenging even
for fairly simple Markov chains. Already for the one-dimensional Ising model,
showing cutoff is a longstanding open problem.
  We settle the above by establishing cutoff and its location at the high
temperature regime of the Ising model on the lattice with periodic boundary
conditions. Our results hold for any dimension and at any temperature where
there is strong spatial mixing: For $\Z^2$ this carries all the way to the
critical temperature. Specifically, for fixed $d\geq 1$, the continuous-time
Glauber dynamics for the Ising model on $(\Z/n\Z)^d$ with periodic boundary
conditions has cutoff at $(d/2\lambda_\infty)\log n$, where $\lambda_\infty$ is
the spectral gap of the dynamics on the infinite-volume lattice. To our
knowledge, this is the first time where cutoff is shown for a Markov chain
where even understanding its stationary distribution is limited.
  The proof hinges on a new technique for translating $L^1$ to $L^2$ mixing
which enables the application of log-Sobolev inequalities. The technique is
general and carries to other monotone and anti-monotone spin-systems.

quantitatively constrained by IRAS observations of thermal emission, but also
qualitatively consistent with other zodiacal cloud observations. We find that
85-95% of the observed mid-infrared emission is produced by particles from the
Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and $<$10% by dust from long period comets.
Asteroidal dust is found to be present at $<$10%. We suggest that spontaneous
disruptions of JFCs, rather than the usual cometary activity driven by
sublimating volatiles, is the main mechanism that librates cometary particles
into the zodiacal cloud. Our results imply that JFC particles represent
$\sim$85% of the total mass influx at Earth. Since their atmospheric entry
speeds are typically low ($\approx$14.5 km s$^{-1}$ mean for D=100-200 $\mu$m
with $\approx$12 km s$^{-1}$ being the most common case), many JFC grains
should survive frictional heating and land on the Earth's surface. This
explains why most micrometeorites collected in antarctic ice have primitive
carbonaceous composition. The present mass of the inner zodiacal cloud at $<$5
AU is estimated to be 1-$2\times10^{19}$ g, mainly in D=100-200 $\mu$m

enhancement of the specific heat will occur for small values $h\simeq\Delta$ of

coordination number. Equations of state are obtained relating entropy, volume
fraction and compactivity characterizing the different states of jammed matter,
and elucidating the phase diagram for jammed granular matter. Analytical
calculations are compared to numerical simulations using volume fluctuation
analysis and graph theoretical methods, with reasonable agreement. The entropy
of the jammed system reveals that the random loose packings are more disordered
than random close packings, allowing for an unambiguous interpretation of both
limits. Ensemble calculations show that the entropy vanishes at random close
packing (RCP), while numerical simulations show that a finite entropy remains
in the microscopic states at RCP. The notion of a negative compactivity, that
explores states with volume fractions below those achievable by existing
simulation protocols, is also explored, expanding the equations of state. We

potential for uses in miniaturised detectors and optical circuits. For many
applications these modes are excited locally. In the optical regime, Surface
Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) have been thought to dominate the fields at the
surface, beyond a transition region comprising 3-4 wavelengths from the source.
In this work we demonstrate that at sufficiently long distances SPPs are not
the main contribution to the field. Instead, for all metals, a different type
of wave prevails, which we term Norton waves for their reminiscence to those
found in the radio-wave regime at the surface of the Earth. Our results show
that Norton Waves are stronger at the surface than SPPs at distances larger
than 6-9 SPP's absorption lengths, the precise value depending on wavelength
and metal. Moreover, Norton waves decay more slowly than SPPs in the direction
normal to the surface.

variation of the HNCO/CS abundance ratio as a diagnostic of the physics and
chemistry in regions of massive star formation. A numerical-chemical model has
been developed which self-consistently follows the chemical evolution of a hot
core. The model comprises of two distinct stages. An initial collapse phase is
immediately followed by an increase in temperature which represents the switch
on of a central massive star and the subsequent evolution of the chemistry in a
hot, dense gas cloud (the hot core). During the collapse phase, gas species are
allowed to accrete on to grain surfaces where they can participate in further
reactions. During the hot core phase surface species thermally desorb back in
to the ambient gas and further chemical evolution takes place. For comparison,
the chemical network was also used to model a simple dark cloud and
photodissociation regions. Our investigation reveals that HNCO is inefficiently
formed when only gas-phase formation pathways are considered in the chemical
network with reaction rates consistent with existing laboratory data. Using
currently measured gas phase reaction rates, obtaining the observed HNCO
abundances requires its formation on grain surfaces. However our model shows
that the gas phase HNCO in hot cores is not a simple direct product of the
evaporation of grain mantles. We also show that the HNCO/CS abundance ratio
varies as a function of time in hot cores and can match the range of values
observed. This ratio is not unambiguously related to the ambient UV field as
been suggested - our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of Martin et
al (2008). In addition, our results show that this ratio is extremely sensitive
to the initial sulphur abundance.

the exponential behavior of 4D fermion zero mode profiles. The mixings and
masses of fermions are closely related to the family problem. By adjusting
parameters in this model, the numerical results can be very close to the

estimates a support set I from a current reconstruction and obtains a new
reconstruction by solving the minimization problem \min{\sum_{i\not\in

differs from the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method, as well as its
variants, because (i) the index set I in ISD is not necessarily nested or
increasing and (ii) the minimization problem above updates all the components
of x at the same time. We generalize the Null Space Property to Truncated Null

  We introduce an efficient implementation of ISD, called threshold--ISD, for
recovering signals with fast decaying distributions of nonzeros from
compressive sensing measurements. Numerical experiments show that
threshold--ISD has significant advantages over the classical l_1 minimization

Planet--planet scattering induced by convergent planetary migration and mean

with inclinations as large as $20^\circ-30^\circ$. In this scenario the tidal
interaction of the planet with the disk is more complex and, in addition to the
usual Lindblad and corotation resonances, it involves also inclination
resonances responsible of bending waves.
  We have performed three--dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the disk and
of its interactions with the planet with a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
(SPH) code. A main result is that the initial large eccentricity and
inclination of the planetary orbit are rapidly damped on a timescale of the
order of $10^3$ yrs, almost independently of the initial semimajor axis and
eccentricity of the planet. The disk is warped in response to the planet
perturbations and it precesses. Inward migration occurs also when the planet is
inclined and it has a drift rate which is intermediate between type I and type
II migration. The planet is not able to open a gap until its inclination
becomes lower than $\sim 10^\circ$ when it also begins to accrete a significant
amount of mass from the disk.

an analytical study on the stress-induced phase transitions in a thin SMA layer
(a simple structure in which the two coalescence processes can happen). We
derive a quasi-2D model with a non-convex effective strain energy function
while taking into account the rate-independent dissipation effect. By using a
coupled series-asymptotic expansion method, we manage to express the total
energy dissipation in terms of the leading-order term of the axial strain. The
equilibrium equations are obtained by maximizing the total energy dissipation,
which are then solved analytically under suitable boundary conditions. The
analytical results reveal that the mechanism for such instabilities is the
presence of ""limited points"", which cause the switch of nontrivial solution
modes to trivial solution modes. Descriptions for the whole coalescence
processes of two fronts are also provided based on the analytical solutions,
which also capture the morphology varies of the specimen. It is also revealed
the key role played by the thickness-length ratio on these instabilities: the
zero limit of which can lead to the smooth switch of nontrivial modes to
trivial modes with no stress drop or stress jump.

its robustness. The robustness was assessed in terms of a proper stability
function, the negative variations of which correspond to a more robust code.
The fraction of more robust codes obtained under small modifications appeared
to be unexpectedly high, ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 depending on the choice of
stability function and code modifications, yet significantly lower than the
corresponding fraction in the random codes (about a half). In this sense the
standard code ought to be considered distinctly non-random in accordance with
previous observations. The distribution of the negative variations of stability
function revealed very abrupt drop beyond one standard deviation, much sharper
than for Gaussian distribution or for the random codes with the same number of
codons in the sets coding for amino acids or stop-codons. This behavior holds
for both the standard code as a whole and its binary NRN-NYN, NWN-NSN, and
NMN-NKN blocks. Previously, it has been proved that such binary block structure
is necessary for the robustness of a code and is inherent to the standard
genetic code. The modifications of the standard code corresponding to more
robust coding may be related to the different variants of the code. These
effects may also contribute to the rates of replacements of amino acids. The
observed features demonstrate the joint impact of random factors and natural
selection during evolution of the genetic code.

attenuation introduce phase-dependent X-ray variability in systems with
circular orbits, while strong variations in the intrinsic emission also occur
in systems with eccentric orbits. The X-ray emission in eccentric systems can
display strong hysteresis, with the emission softer after periastron than at
corresponding orbital phases prior to periastron, reflecting the physical state
of the shocked plasma at these times. Furthermore, the rise of the luminosity
to maximum does not necessarily follow a 1/D law. Our models further
demonstrate that the effective circumstellar column can be highly energy
dependent.

constrained to ~15% if the halo concentration c is known, and to < 30% if not.
We argue that the inevitable degeneracy between density-profile slope and halo
concentration cannot be lifted under realistic conditions, and show by means of
Fisher-matrix methods which linear combination of $\alpha$ and c is best
constrained by our filtering of lensing data. This defines a new parameter,
called P1, which is then constrained to ~15% for a single massive halo. If the
signals of many halos can be stacked, their density profiles should thus be
well constrained by the linear filters proposed here with the advantagebe
insensitive to the cluster substructures.

of the mean brightness of the star. In addition, we extracted two periodicities
interpreted as components of a rotationally split multiplet that indicate a
rotation period of the order of 2-5 days. We also recovered the first harmonic

orbits delimit a forbidden band for time-like circular orbits, which is
interpreted in terms of optical geometry. For large L, time-like circular

structure, Alfven wave perturbations of long periods (~ 22 yrs) that excite in
the solar core travel first to the poles in both the hemispheres and later
reach the equator. While traveling towards the surface, Alfven wave
perturbations along the weak poloidal field structure in turn perturb the
embedded strong toroidal field structure producing sunspots, especially in the
convective envelope, that travel to the surface due to buoyancy along
isorotational contours. With realistic density structure of the solar interior,
computation of Alfven wave travel times along different field lines of the

subhaloes, making them denser. The increased central density of such a subhalo,
results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalo
simulated with only dark matter. The increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloes
with respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be more
effective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host. This results in
these subhaloes being effectively more radially concentrated then their dark
matter counterparts.

understand high-Tc cuprate superconductors. A fundamental question is what
symmetries are broken when that phase sets in below a temperature T*. There is
evidence from both polarized neutron diffraction and polar Kerr effect
measurements that time- reversal symmetry is broken, but at temperatures that
differ significantly. Broken rotational symmetry was detected by both
resistivity and inelastic neutron scattering at low doping and by scanning
tunnelling spectroscopy at low temperature, but with no clear connection to T*.
Here we report the observation of a large in-plane anisotropy of the Nernst
effect in YBa2Cu3Oy that sets in precisely at T*, throughout the doping phase

responsible for this anisotropy, which is therefore an intrinsic property of
the CuO2 planes. We conclude that the pseudogap phase is an electronic state
which strongly breaks four-fold rotational symmetry. This narrows the range of
possible states considerably, pointing to stripe or nematic orders.

real-life settings due to privacy issues or an ongoing elicitation process. In
addition, there may be uncertainty about how the preferences are aggregated.
For example, the agenda (a tree whose leaves are labelled with the decisions
being compared) may not yet be known or fixed. We therefore study how to
determine collectively optimal decisions (also called winners) when preferences
may be incomplete, and when the agenda may be uncertain. We show that it is
computationally easy to determine if a candidate decision always wins, or may
win, whatever the agenda. On the other hand, it is computationally hard to know
wheth er a candidate decision wins in at least one agenda for at least one
completion of the agents' preferences. These results hold even if the agenda
must be balanced so that each candidate decision faces the same number of
majority votes. Such results are useful for reasoning about preference
elicitation. They help understand the complexity of tasks such as determining
if a decision can be taken collectively, as well as knowing if the winner can
be manipulated by appropriately ordering the agenda.

where some of the preferences may be missing. This models, for example,
settings where agents are distributed and have privacy issues, or where there
is an ongoing preference elicitation process. In this setting, we study how to
find a solution which is optimal irrespective of the missing preferences. In
the process of finding such a solution, we may elicit preferences from the user
if necessary. However, our goal is to ask the user as little as possible. We
define a combined solving and preference elicitation scheme with a large number
of different instantiations, each corresponding to a concrete algorithm which
we compare experimentally. We compute both the number of elicited preferences
and the ""user effort"", which may be larger, as it contains all the preference
values the user has to compute to be able to respond to the elicitation
requests. While the number of elicited preferences is important when the
concern is to communicate as little information as possible, the user effort
measures also the hidden work the user has to do to be able to communicate the
elicited preferences. Our experimental results show that some of our algorithms

becomes especially obvious in the presence of Feshbach resonances. Due to its
complexity, however, single-channel (SC) approximations, which reproduce the
long-range behavior of the open channel, are often applied in calculations. In
this work the complete MC problem is solved numerically for the magnetic
Feshbach resonances (MFRs) in collisions between generic ultracold 6Li and 87Rb
atoms in the ground state and in the presence of a static magnetic field B. The
obtained MC solutions are used to test various existing as well as presently
developed SC approaches. It was found that many aspects even at short
internuclear distances are qualitatively well reflected. This can be used to
investigate molecular processes in the presence of an external trap or in
many-body systems that can be feasibly treated only within the framework of the
SC approximation. The applicability of various SC approximations is tested for
a transition to the absolute vibrational ground state around an MFR. The
conformance of the SC approaches is explained by the two-channel approximation
for the MFR.

which show that the star has reached a visual minimum phase in 2009. More
importantly, we detected absorptions due to Si IV 4088-4116 Angstroms. To match
their observed line profiles from 2009 May, a high rotational velocity of
vrot=150 +- 20 km/s is needed (assuming an inclination angle of 30 degrees),
implying that HR Car rotates at ~0.88 +- 0.2 of its critical velocity for
break-up (vcrit). Our results suggest that fast rotation is typical in all
strong-variable, bona-fide galactic LBVs, which present S Dor-type variability.
Strong-variable LBVs are located in a well-defined region of the HR diagram
during visual minimum (the ""LBV minimum instability strip""). We suggest this
region corresponds to where vcrit is reached. To the left of this strip, a
forbidden zone with vrot/vcrit>1 is present, explaining why no LBVs are
detected in this zone. Since dormant/ex LBVs like P Cygni and HD 168625 have
low vrot, we propose that LBVs can be separated in two groups: fast-rotating,
strong-variable stars showing S-Dor cycles (such as AG Car and HR Car) and
slow-rotating stars with much less variability (such as P Cygni and HD 168625).
We speculate that SN progenitors which had S-Dor cycles before exploding (such
as in SN 2001ig, SN 2003bg, and SN 2005gj) could have been fast rotators. We
suggest that the potential difficulty of fast-rotating Galactic LBVs to lose
angular momentum is an additional evidence that such stars could explode during
the LBV phase.

Bayesian inference has been tested against multiband infrared radiometric
imagery from the Terra MODIS instrument. Bayesian LST estimators are shown to
reproduce standard MODIS product LST values starting from a parsimoniously
chosen (hence, uninformative) range of prior band emissivity knowledge. Two
estimation methods have been tested. The first is the iterative contraction
mapping of joint expectation values for LST and surface emissivity described in
a previous paper. In the second method, the Bayesian algorithm is reformulated
as a Maximum \emph{A-Posteriori} (MAP) search for the maximum joint
\emph{a-posteriori} probability for LST, given observed sensor aperture
radiances and \emph{a-priori} probabilities for LST and emissivity.
  Two MODIS data granules each for daytime and nighttime were used for the
comparison. The granules were chosen to be largely cloud-free, with limited
vertical relief in those portions of the granules for which the sensor zenith
angle $| ZA | < 30^{\circ}$. Level 1B radiances were used to obtain LST
estimates for comparison with the Level 2 MODIS LST product.
  The Bayesian LST estimators accurately reproduce standard MODIS product LST
values. In particular, the mean discrepancy for the MAP retrievals is $| <
\Delta T > | < 0.3 K$, and its standard deviation does not exceed $1 K$. The
$\pm 68 %$ confidence intervals for individual LST estimates associated with
assumed uncertainty in surface emissivity are of order $0.8 K$.
  The Appendix presents a proof of convergence of the iterative contraction
mapping algorithm.

using the singular perturbative method presented in Alard 2007, MNRAS Letters,
382, 58 and Alard, C., 2008, MNRAS, 388, 375. The ability of the perturbative
method to separate the inner and outer contributions of the potential in
gravitational lenses is tested using SL2S02176-0513. In this lens, the
gravitational field of the central galaxy is dominated by a nearby group of
galaxies located at a distance of a few critical radius. The perturbative
functionals are re-constructed using local polynomials. The polynomial
interpolation is smoothed using Fourier series, and numerically fitted to HST
data using a non-linear minimization procedure. The potential inside and
outside the critical circle is derived from the reconstruction of the
perturbative fields. The inner and outer potential contours are very
different.The inner contours are consistent with the central galaxy, while the
outer contours are fully consistent with the perturbation introduced by the
group of galaxies. The ability of the perturbative method to separate the inner
and outer contribution is confirmed, and indicates that in the perturbative
approach the field of the central deflector can be separated from outer
perturbations. The separation of the inner and outer contribution is especially
important for the study of the shape of dark matter halo's as well as for the
statistical analysis of the effect of dark matter substructures.

quantum dots which exhibits a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition as a
function of the tunnel couplings of the chain with the electrodes. Using a
combination of analytical and numerical methods, we establish that the full
counting statistics is conventional away from the phase transition, but
becomes, in a well-defined sense, essentially non-Gaussian on the critical
line, where the current fluctuations are controlled by the dynamic critical
exponent $z$. We find that signatures of the critical full counting statistics
persist in quantum-dot chains of finite length.

a series of isolated poles in the complex angular momentum plane. One of our
earlier findings was that the subleading hard BFKL exchanges decouple from such
experimentally important observables as small-$x$ charm, $F_2^c$, and the
longitudinal, $F_L$, structure functions of the proton at moderately large
$Q^2$. For instance, we predicted precocious BFKL asymptotics of $F_2^c(x,Q^2)$
with intercept of the rightmost BFKL pole
$\alpha_{\Pom}(0)-1=\Delta_{\Pom}\approx 0.4$. On the other hand, the small-$x$
open beauty photo- and electro-production probes the vacuum exchange for much
smaller color dipoles which entails significant subleading vacuum pole
corrections to the small-$x$ behavior. In view of the accumulation of the
experimental data on small-$x$ $F_{2}^{c}$, $F_{2}^{b}$ and $F_{L}$ we extend
our early predictions to the kinematical domain covered by new HERA
measurements. Our parameter-free results agree well with the determination of
$F_2^c$, $F_L$ and published H1 results on $F_2^b$ but slightly overshoot the
very recent (2008, preliminary) H1 results on $F_2^b$.

boundary problem described by the Grad-Shafranov equation in axisymmetric
configuration. The right-hand side of this equation is a nonlinear source,
which represents the toroidal component of the plasma current density. This
paper deals with the identification of this nonlinearity source from
experimental measurements in real time. The proposed method is based on a fixed
point algorithm, a finite element resolution, a reduced basis method and a
least-square optimization formulation. This is implemented in a software called
Equinox with which several numerical experiments are conducted to explore the
identification problem. It is shown that the identification of the profile of
the averaged current density and of the safety factor as a function of the
poloidal flux is very robust.

resource, indeed almost all multiparty protocols can be written in terms of
graph states including measurement based quantum computation (MBQC), error
correction and secret sharing amongst others. In addition they are at the
forefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent
opportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these
elements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret
sharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.
We do so with two main contributions.
  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access
which information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct
graphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph
theory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to
present new secret sharing protocols.
  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,
i.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to
include vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence
considered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits
in terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns
to secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is
believed also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based
schemes, for example in constructing fault tolerant MBQC schemes.
