also find a decrease in the A(Li) with decreasing Teff, both in MS and SG
stars, albeit with a significantly different slope for the two classes of
stars. This suggests that the lithium abundance in these stars is, indeed,
altered by some process, which is Teff-dependent. The Li abundance pattern
observed in NGC 6397 is different from what is found among field stars, casting
some doubt on the use of Globular Cluster stars as representative of Population

Maxwell's equations in such a medium numerically. We consider two situations:
first a $90\degr$ bent photonic crystal wave-guide and second a centrally
pulsed photonic crystal micro-cavity. We plot various figures for each case

in the wave-guide situation, we show that the general shape of the normalized
total output energy is a Gaussian function of randomness with
wavelength-dependent width. For centrally pulsed PC, the output energy curves
display extremum behavior both as a function of time as well as randomness. We
explain these effects in terms of two distinct but simultaneous effects which
emerge with increasing randomness, namely the creation of semi-localized modes
and the shrinking (and eventual destruction) of the photonic band-gaps.
Semi-localized (i.e. Anderson localized) modes are seen to arise as a
synchronization of internal modes within a cluster of randomly positioned
dielectric nano-particles. The general trend we observe shows a sharp change of

Herbig Ae/Be stars and possibly massive YSOs, providing original near-IR

shows that they are located along the dusty filamentary structures of N66 seen
in mid- and far-IR dust emission and agrees very well with that of previously
detected candidate YSOs and PMS stars. Our study provides an original accurate

significant information on the star formation process in NGC 346/N66, it is

optically thin in the radial direction. Thus photons generated at some radii
can cool or heat electrons at other radii via Compton scattering. Such global
Compton scattering has previously been shown to be important for the dynamics
of accretion flows. Here, we extend previous treatments of this problem by
using accurate global general relativistic Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on
an inner region of the accretion flow (R < 600R_g), for which we obtain a
global self-consistent solution. As compared to the initial, not
self-consistent solution, the final solution has both the cooling rate and the
electron temperature significantly reduced at radii >=10 gravitational radii.
On the other hand, the radiation spectrum of the self-consistent solution has
the shape similar to that of the initial iteration, except for the high-energy
cut-off being at an energy lower by a factor of ~2 and the bolometric
luminosity decreased by a factor of ~2. We also compare the global Compton
scattering model with local models in spherical and slab geometry. We find that
the slab model approximates the global model significantly better than the
spherical one. Still, neither local model gives a good approximation to the
radial profile of the cooling rate, and the differences can be up to two orders
of magnitude. The local slab model underestimates the cooling rate at outer
regions whereas it overestimates that rate at inner regions. We compare our
modelling results to observed hard-state spectra of black-hole binaries and
find an overall good agreement provided any disc outflow is weak. We find that
general-relativistic effects in flows which dynamics is modified by global
Comptonization is crucial in approaching this agreement.

supernovae established the fact that the expansion of the universe is
accelerated. This is interpreted by saying that there exists some kind of agent
(called dark energy), which exerts an overall repulsive effect on ordinary
matter. Dark energy contributes today in the amount of about 73 % to the total
energy content of the universe, and its spatial distribution is compatible with
perfect uniformity. The simplest possible explanation for dark energy is to
assume that it is just a universal constant, the so called cosmological
constant. This would mean that the background arena for all natural phenomena,
once all physical matter-energy has been ideally removed, is the de Sitter
space time. Thus, the Poincar\'e group should be replaced by the de Sitter
group, and one is naturally led to a reformulation of the theory of special
relativity on these grounds. The absence of a privileged class of equivalent
frames (inertial frames) suggests that, in de Sitter relativity it would be
desirable, to characterize significant physical quantities in an intrinsic way,
namely in a manner independent of the choice of any particular coordinate
patch. In this talk we would like to show how this can be accomplished for any

and irreversible flow in vortex matter. The topology of the vortex array
crucially determines the flow response of this system. To illustrate this
claim, two limiting cases are considered: weak and strong pinning interactions.
In the first case disorder is strong enough to introduce plastic effects in the
vortex lattice. Diffraction patterns unveil polycrystalline lattice topology
with dislocations and grain boundaries determining the electromagnetic response
of the system. Filamentary flow is found to arise as a consequence of
dislocation dynamics. We analize the stability of vortex lattices against the
formation of grain boundaries, as well as the steady state dynamics for
currents approaching the depinning critical current from above, when vortex
motion is mainly localized at the grain boundaries. On the contrary, a
dislocation description proves no longer adequate in the second limiting case
examined. For strong pinning interactions, the vortex array appears completely
amorphous and no remnant of the Abrikosov lattice order is left. Here we obtain
the critical current as a function of impurity density, its scaling properties,
and characterize the steady state dynamics above depinning. The plastic
depinning observed in the amorphous phase is tightly connected with the
emergence of channel-like flow. Our results suggest the possibility of
establishing a clear distinction between two topologically disordered vortex
phases: the vortex polycrystal and the amorphous vortex matter.

topologically similar to the flow arising from a single stellar HD wind. Our

unary stack alphabet. We study the computational complexity of model checking
computation tree logic (CTL) over OCPs. A PSPACE upper bound is inherited from
the modal mu-calculus for this problem. First, we analyze the periodic
behaviour of CTL over OCPs and derive a model checking algorithm whose running
time is exponential only in the number of control locations and a syntactic
notion of the formula that we call leftward until depth. Thus, model checking
fixed OCPs against CTL formulas with a fixed leftward until depth is in P. This
generalizes a result of the first author, Mayr, and To for the expression
complexity of CTL's fragment EF. Second, we prove that already over some fixed
OCP, CTL model checking is PSPACE-hard. Third, we show that there already
exists a fixed CTL formula for which model checking of OCPs is PSPACE-hard. To
obtain the latter result, we employ two results from complexity theory: (i)
Converting a natural number in Chinese remainder presentation into binary
presentation is in logspace-uniform NC^1 and (ii) PSPACE is AC^0-serializable.
We demonstrate that our approach can be used to obtain further results. We show
that model-checking CTL's fragment EF over OCPs is hard for P^NP, thus
establishing a matching lower bound and answering an open question of the first
author, Mayr, and To. We moreover show that the following problem is hard for
PSPACE: Given a one-counter Markov decision process, a set of target states
with counter value zero each, and an initial state, to decide whether the
probability that the initial state will eventually reach one of the target
states is arbitrarily close to 1. This improves a previously known lower bound

in the framework of the general form of the 3-3-1 models. We identify two
important sources of corrections: oblique corrections asociated to the

particle-antiparticle pairs of new heavy quarks $J$, and vertex corrections to
the $Z^{\prime}q\bar{q}$ vertex through virtual exchange of new $K^{Q_{1,2}}$

oblique corrections that exhibit a quadratic dependence on the $J$ quark mass,
which are absorbed into two oblique parameters: a global parameter $\rho
^{\prime}_f$ which modify the $Z^{\prime}$ decay width, and a parameter $\kappa
^{\prime}_{f}$ that define effective $Z^{\prime}$ couplings. Numerical results
in an specific 3-3-1 model gives a strong contribution of the oblique
corrections from about 1.3% in the $d(s)$ quark channel to 10.5% in the
neutrino channel, for $m_{J}=2$ TeV. The vertex corrections contribute to the
oblique corrections up to 1.4% for the same channel and $m_{J}$ value. For $pp$
collisions at the CERN LHC collider, we find that the corrections significantly
modify the shape of the cross section distributions for $e^{+}e^{-}$ and
$t\bar{t}$ final states, where the distributions including the radiative
corrections increases up to 1.23 times the tree-level distribution for the

equilibrium, which implies that C^18O gas represents parental dense clumps for
cluster formation. From the spatial relation between the distributions of
clumps and clusters, we classified C^18O clumps into three types (Type A, B,
and C). The C^18O clumps as classified into Type A have emission distributions
with a single peak at the stellar clusters and higher brightness contrast than
that of other target sources. Type B clumps have double or triple peaks which
are associated with the cluster and moderately high brightness contrast
structure. Type C clumps have also multiple peaks although they are not
associated with the cluster and low brightness contrast structure. We suggest
that our classification represents an evolutionary trend of cluster-forming
dense clumps because dense gas in molecular clouds is expected to be converted
into stellar constituents, or to be dispersed by stellar activities. Moreover,
although there is a scatter, we found a tendency that the SFEs of the dense
clumps increase from Type A to Type C, which also supports our scenario.

thermal evolution is considerably different from that in the first star
formation. Reflecting the difference, two hydrostatic cores appear in a nested
manner: a protostar is enclosed by a transient hydrostatic core, which appears
during the prestellar collapse. If the initial natal core rotates fast at a
rate with rotational to gravitational energy ratio \beta_0 > 0.01-0.1, the
transient hydrostatic core fragments to \sim 10 M_\odot sub-cores at density
\sim 10^9 cm^-3. With smaller rotation energy, fragmentation occurs at higher
density while a single protostar forms without fragmentation if rotation is
extremely slow with \beta_0 < 10^-6 -10^-5. If magnetic field is present, these
threshold values of \beta_0 is boosted owing to angular momentum transport by
the magnetic breaking. Magnetic field also drives the protostellar outflows.
With strong magnetic field, two distinct outflows are observed: The slower one
emanates from the transient hydrostatic core, while the faster one from the
protostar. These flows may affect the final stellar mass by ejecting some of
masses in the initial core, and also may play some role in driving and

of the stable transient activity neural networks observed in experiments. This
new approach is in contrast to traditional system analysis usually adopted in
cognitive modeling. Transient dynamics offers a sound formalism of the observed
qualities of brain activity, while providing a rigorous set of analysis tools.
Transients have two main features: First, they are resistant to noise, and
reliable even in the face of small variations in initial conditions; the
sequence of states visited by the system (its trajectory), is thus structurally
stable. Second, the transients are input-specific, and thus convey information
about what caused them in the first place. This new dynamical view manifests a
rigorous explanation of how perception, cognition, emotion, and other mental
processes evolve as a sequence of activity patterns in the brain, and, most
importantly, how they interfere with each other. The ideas discussed and
demonstrated here lead to the creation of a quantitative theory of the human
mental activity and can be deployed on artificial agents.

applications is becoming popular. They need the ability to gain rapid and
scalable access to high-end computing capabilities. Cloud computing promises to
deliver such a computing infrastructure using data centers so that HPC users
can access applications and data from a Cloud anywhere in the world on demand
and pay based on what they use. However, the growing demand drastically
increases the energy consumption of data centers, which has become a critical
issue. High energy consumption not only translates to high energy cost, which
will reduce the profit margin of Cloud providers, but also high carbon
emissions which is not environmentally sustainable. Hence, energy-efficient
solutions are required that can address the high increase in the energy
consumption from the perspective of not only Cloud provider but also from the
environment. To address this issue we propose near-optimal scheduling policies
that exploits heterogeneity across multiple data centers for a Cloud provider.
We consider a number of energy efficiency factors such as energy cost, carbon
emission rate, workload, and CPU power efficiency which changes across
different data center depending on their location, architectural design, and
management system. Our carbon/energy based scheduling policies are able to
achieve on average up to 30% of energy savings in comparison to profit based
scheduling policies leading to higher profit and less carbon emissions.

the exact solution was fairly slow. New base functions and auxiliary linear
operator to form a better homotopy are the main concern of the present paper.
It is known that proper choice of base functions and auxiliary operator is

computational cost. The proposed homotopy here not only greatly reduces the
computational efforts by at least doubling the convergence of the homotopy
series, but also enlarges the convergence region of the homotopy series as

the directional derivatives and gradients of the response with respect to the
predictor functions. In statistical applications and data analysis, functional
derivatives provide a quantitative measure of the often intricate relationship
between changes in predictor trajectories and those in scalar responses. This
approach provides a natural extension of classical gradient fields in vector

slow-down rate. If such glitches occur every 30 years, the spin-down rate, and
by inference the magnetic dipole moment, will drop to zero on a timescale of a
few thousand years. There are also significant increases in the rate of pulse
detection and in the radio pulse energy immediately following the glitches.

  We exhibit a codimension-one critical real-analytic manifold N of
asymptotically stable solutions in a neighborhood of the soliton manifold. We
then show that N is centre-stable, in the dynamical systems sense of
Bates-Jones, and globally-in-time invariant.
  Solutions in N are asymptotically stable and separate into two asymptotically

normal metal rings threaded by a magnetic flux $\phi$ are investigated within
the tight-binding framework considering long-range hopping of electrons in the
{\em shortest} path. The higher order hopping integrals try to reduce the
effect of disorder by delocalizing the energy eigenstates, and accordingly,
current amplitude in disordered rings becomes comparable to that of an ordered
ring. Our study of low-field magnetic susceptibility predicts that the sign of
persistent currents can be mentioned precisely in mesoscopic rings with fixed
number of electrons, even in the presence of impurity in the rings. For perfect
rings, low-field current shows only the diamagnetic sign irrespective of the
total number of electrons $N_e$. On the other hand, in disordered rings it
exhibits the diamagnetic and paramagnetic natures for the rings with odd and
even $N_e$ respectively.

detected 57 sources above a limiting flux density of 5mJy, of which 31 sources
have a flux density greater than 10mJy, which is our effective completeness

10mJy at 30 GHz of 2.0+/-0.4 per square degree. This is consistent with the
surface density obtained by Mason et al. (2009) who observed a large sample of
sources selected at a much lower frequency (1.4 GHz). We have also investigated
the dependence of the spectral index distribution on flux density by comparing
our results with those for sources above 1 Jy selected from the WMAP 22 GHz

with decreasing flux density, qualitatively consistent with the predictions of

is lower than the growth temperature and unlikely to result in any structural
change. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy measurements showed that upon
thermal treatment (823 K), various broad absorption features diminished: an
absorption band at 270 nm (used to deduce neutral single substitutional
nitrogen (NS 0) concentrations), and also two broad features centred at
approximately 360 and 520 nm. Point defect centre concentrations as a function
of temperature were also deduced using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
spectroscopy. Above ~500 K, we observed a decrease in the concentration of NS 0
centres and a concomitant increase in the negatively charged
nitrogen-vacancy-hydrogen complex (NVH \bar) concentration. Both transitions
exhibited an activation energy between 0.6 and 1.2 eV, which is lower than that
for the NS 0 donor (~1.7 eV). Finally, it was found that illuminating samples
with intense short-wave ultraviolet light recovered the NS 0 concentration and
also the 270, 360 and 520 nm absorption features. From these results, we
postulate a valence-band mediated charge-transfer process between NVH and
single nitrogen centres with an acceptor trap depth for NVH of 0.6- 1.2 eV.
Because the loss of NS 0 concentration is greater than the increase in NVH \bar
concentration we also suggest the presence of another unknown acceptor existing
at a similar energy as NVH. The extent to which the colour in CVD synthetic
diamond is dependent on prior history is discussed.

X-ray selected clusters. We convolve the SDSS images of the BCGs to match the

formation. The BCGs in the X-ray selected cluster sample span a similar range

are shown to be reduced by using substrates with a combination of low surface

only a minority of defects intersect the epitaxial surface are also shown to
lead to a reduction in dislocation density. Anisotropy in the birefringence of
single crystal CVD diamond due to the preferential direction of dislocation
propagation is reported. Ultra low birefringence plates (< 10-5) are now
available for intra-cavity heat spreaders in solid state disc lasers, and the
application is no longer limited by depolarisation losses. Birefringence of

nucleation of dislocations at the interface between the CVD layer and its

birefringence microscopy of HPHT grown synthetic type IIa diamond clearly show
that the extended defect content is growth sector dependent. <111> sectors
contain the highest concentration of both stacking faults and dislocations but

Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) waveguide resonator, i.e. a waveguide
with end-face dielectric multi-layer mirrors. This is a monolithic doubly
resonant Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) far below threshold, which
generates photon pairs by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) at
around 1560nm with a 117MHz (0.91 pm)- bandwidth. A coherence time of 2.7 ns is
estimated by a time correlation measurement and a high quality of the entangled
states is confirmed by a Bell-type experiment. Since highly coherent
energy-time entangled photon pairs in the telecom regime are suitable for long
distance transmission and manipulation, this source is well suited to the
requirements of quantum communication.

allowing the system to adapt the transmission and reception strategies to
changes in channel conditions. One of the fundamental components of the link
adaptation mechanism is signal to noise ratio (SNR) estimation, measuring the
instantaneous (mostly post processing) SNR at the receiver. That is, the SNR at
the decoder input, which is an important metric for the prediction of decoder
performance. In linearly decoded MIMO, which is the common MIMO decoding
strategy, the post processing SNR is well defined. However, this is not the
case in optimal maximum likelihood (ML) decoding applied to spatial
multiplexing (SM). This gap is interesting since ML decoded SM is gaining ever
growing interest in recent research and practice due to the rapid increase in
computation power, and available near optimal low complexity schemes. In this
paper we close the gap and provide SNR estimation schemes for ML decoded SM,
which are based on various approximations of the ""per stream"" error
probability. The proposed methods are applicable for both horizonal and
vertical decoding. Moreover, we propose a very low complexity implementation
for the SNR estimation mechanism employing the ML decoder itself with
negligible overhead.

solar granulation in the photosphere and low chromosphere up to 650 km. We use
velocity and intensity variations obtained at different atmospheric heights
from observations in BaII 4554 A. The observations were done during good seeing
conditions at the VTT at the Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. The line core
forms rather high in the atmosphere and allows granulation properties to be
studied at heights that have been not accessed before in similar studies. In
addition, we analyze the synthetic profiles of the BaII 4554 A line by the same
method computed taking NLTE effects into account in the 3D hydrodynamical model
atmosphere. We suggest a 16-column model of solar granulation depending on the
direction of motion and on the intensity contrast measured in the continuum and
in the uppermost layer. We calculate the heights of intensity contrast sign
reversal and velocity sign reversal. We show that both parameters depend
strongly on the granulation velocity and intensity at the bottom photosphere.
The larger the two parameters, the higher the reversal takes place in the
atmosphere. On average, this happens at about 200-300 km. We suggest that this
number also depends on the line depth of the spectral line used in
observations. Despite the intensity and velocity reversal, about 40% of the
column structure of granulation is preserved up to heights around 650 km.

magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of waves for a realistic atmospheric
stratification of a cool Ap star. We explore a grid of simulations in a wide

the propagation and reflection properties of magneto-acoustic waves, formation
of node surfaces, and relative variation of different quantities. Our

roAp stars. We show, for the first time, that the overall depth dependence of
the pulsations in roAp atmospheres is strongly influenced by the density
inversion at the photospheric base.

Temperatures are highest adjacent to the central HII region, indicating that
the embedded cluster of young stars there is heating the gas. Six new water

that seven cores will go on to form massive stars between 15 and 50 solar
masses. The large scale velocity structure of the filament is smooth, but at
least one clump shows the signature of inward gas motions via asymmetries in
the NH3 (1,1) line profiles. The same clump exhibits an enhanced abundance of
N2H+, which coupled with an absence of CO indicates depletion onto the dust

to have regularizing effect on the solution because of the non-integrable
angular singularity of the cross-section. However, even though so far this has
been justified satisfactorily for the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation,
it is still basically unsolved for the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann
equation. In this paper, by sharpening the coercivity and upper bound estimates
for the collision operator, establishing the hypo-ellipticity of the Boltzmann
operator based on a generalized version of the uncertainty principle, and
analyzing the commutators between the collision operator and some weighted
pseudo differential operators, we prove the regularizing effect in all (time,
space and velocity) variables on solutions when some mild regularity is imposed
on these solutions. For completeness, we also show that when the initial data
has this mild regularity and Maxwellian type decay in velocity variable, there
exists a unique local solution with the same regularity, so that this solution
enjoys the $C^\infty$ regularity for positive time.

dynamic thermalization of a degenerate quantum system. A three-level system
interacting with a heat bath is carefully studied to this end. It is shown that
the three-level system with degenerate ground states might have different
behaviors depending on the details of the interaction with the heat bath when
the temperature approaches zero. If we introduce an external field to break the
degeneracy of the ground states and let it approach zero after letting the
temperature approach zero, then two possibilities will arise: the steady state
is a definite one of the degenerate states independent of the initial state, or
the steady state is dependent on the initial state in a complicated way. The
first possibility corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the system
and the second one implies that the heat bath could not totally erase the
initial information in certain cases.

spectral radius of $G$ and the universal cover of $G$, respectively. In
\cite{Fri03}, Friedman has shown that almost every $n$-lift of $G$ has all of
its new eigenvalues bounded by $O(\lambda_1^{1/2}\rho^{1/2})$. In \cite{LP10},
Linial and Puder have improved this bound to $O(\lambda_1^{1/3}\rho^{2/3})$.
Friedman had conjectured that this bound can actually be improved to $\rho +
o_n(1)$ (e.g., see \cite{Fri03,HLW06}).
  In \cite{LP10}, Linial and Puder have formulated two new categorizations of
formal words, namely $\phi$ and $\beta$, which assign a non-negative integer or
infinity to each word. They have shown that for every word $w$, $\phi(w) = 0$
iff $\beta(w) = 0$, and $\phi(w) = 1$ iff $\beta(w) = 1$. They have conjectured
that $\phi(w) = \beta(w)$ for every word $w$, and have run extensive numerical
simulations that strongly suggest that this conjecture is true. This
conjecture, if proven true, gives us a very promising approach to proving a
slightly weaker version of Friedman's conjecture, namely the bound $O(\rho)$ on
the new eigenvalues (see \cite{LP10}).
  In this paper, we make further progress towards proving this important
conjecture by showing that $\phi(w) = 2$ iff $\beta(w) = 2$ for every word $w$.

crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The phases
of the eigenfunctions are not rigid so that environmentally induced
spectroscopic redistribution processes may take place and a dynamical phase
transition may occur. Due to the formal equivalence between the quantum
mechanical Schr\""odinger equation and the optical wave equation in PT symmetric
lattices, the dynamics of the system is determined also in this case by avoided
and true crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
In contrast to the eigenvalues characterizing an open quantum system, the
eigenvalues describing the PT symmetric optical lattice are real as long as the
influence of the environment (lattice) onto the optical wave equation is small.
In the regime of avoided level crossings, the symmetry is destroyed, the
eigenvalues become complex and a dynamical phase transition occurs similar as
in the open quantum system. The redistribution processes in the regime of
avoided level crossings allow to design systems with desired properties in a
broad parameter range.

opinions mainly because of the weak interaction between the two communities. In
such a case, it is an interesting problem to find the necessary strength of
inter-community interaction in order for the two communities to reach a
consensus. In this paper, the Information Accumulation System (IAS) model is
applied to investigate the problem. With the application of the IAS model, the
opinion dynamics of the two-community problem is found to belong to a wider
class of two-species problems appearing in population dynamics or in
competition of two languages, for all of which the governing equations can be
described in terms of coupled logistic maps. Tipping diffusivity is defined as
the maximal inter-community interaction that the two communities can stay in
different opinions. For a problem with simple community structure and
homogeneous individuals, the tipping diffusivity is calculated theoretically.
As a conclusion of the paper, the convergence of the two communities to the
same value is less possible the more overall interaction, intra-community and
inter-community, takes place. This implies, for example, that the increase in
the interaction between individuals caused by the development of modern
communication tools, such as facebook and twitter, does not necessarily improve
the tendency towards global convergence between different communities. If the
number of internal links increases by a factor, the number of inter-community
links must be increased by an even higher factor, in order for consensus to be

galactocentric distance for the Local Group dwarf galaxy of Phoenix.
Color-magnitude diagram was obtained from WFPC2@HST reaching the oldest main
sequence turnoffs. The IAC-star and IAC-pop codes and the MinnIAC suite have
been used to obtain the star formation rate as a function of time, metallicity,
and radius. We find that Phoenix has had ongoing but gradually decreasing star
formation over nearly a Hubble time. The highest level of star formation
occurred from the formation of the galaxy till 10.5 Gyr ago, when 50% of the
total star formation had already taken place. From that moment, star formation
continues at a significant level until 6 Gyr ago, and at a very low level till
the present time. The chemical enrichment law shows a trend of slowly
increasing metallicity as a function of time till 8--6 Gyr ago, when Z starts
to increase steeply to the current value.
  Young stars are found in the inner region of the galaxy only, but
intermediate-age and old stars can be found at all galactocentric distances.
This study shows that star formation started at all galactocentric distances in
Phoenix at an early epoch. Our results are compatible with a scenario in which
the star formation region envelope slowly shrinks as time goes on, possibly as
a natural result of pressure support reduction as gas supply diminishes. As a
consequence, star formation stopped first in outer regions and the scale-length
of the stellar mass density distribution decreased with time. No traces of a
true, old halo are apparent in Phoenix either in its stellar age distribution
or in the stellar mass density distribution, at least out to 0.5 kpc (about 2.5
scale-lengths) from the center.

and 165 galaxies in the J-filter. We present bulge and disc decompositions of
each galaxy image. All galaxies have been modelled with a Sersic bulge and
exponential disc with the BUDDA v2.1 package.
  The main conclusions of our general statistical analysis of the sample are:
  (1) The distribution of the apparent bulge axis ratio q_b for the subsample
with n < 2 can be attributed to triaxial, nearly prolate bulges that are seen
from different projections, while n > 2 bulges seem to be oblate spheroids with
moderate flattening.
  (2) For the sample galaxies, the effective radius of the bulge r_{e,b}, the
disc scalelength h and the disc scaleheight z_0 are well correlated. However,
there is a clear trend for the ratio r_{e,b}/h to increase with n.
  (3) There is a hint that the fundamental planes of discs, which links only
disc parameters and the maximum rotational velocity of gas, are different for
galaxies with different bulges.
  (4) The investigation of the Photometric Plane of sample bulges shows that
the plane is not flat and has a prominent curvature towards small values of n.
For bulges this fact was not noticed earlier.
  (5) The clear relation between the flattening of stellar discs h/z_0 and the
relative mass of a spherical component, including a dark halo, is confirmed not
for bulgeless galaxies but for galaxies with massive bulges. (Abridged)

small wave numbers. The magnetic field topology near the current sheet is
strongly affected by the turbulence. However, we find that the resulting

in three dimensions, we find no evidence for fast reconnection. The
reconnection speed exhibits large variations but the time averages increase

formulation of CS modified gravity, where the CS coupling field is treated as a
dynamical field, endowed with its own stress-energy tensor and evolution
equation. We consider the possibility of observationally testing dynamical CS
modified gravity by using the accretion disk properties around slowly-rotating
black holes. The energy flux, temperature distribution, the emission spectrum
as well as the energy conversion efficiency are obtained, and compared to the
standard general relativistic Kerr solution. It is shown that the Kerr black
hole provide a more efficient engine for the transformation of the energy of
the accreting mass into radiation than their slowly-rotating counterparts in CS
modified gravity. Specific signatures appear in the electromagnetic spectrum,
thus leading to the possibility of directly testing CS modified gravity by
using astrophysical observations of the emission spectra from accretion disks.
