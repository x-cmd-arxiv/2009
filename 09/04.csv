paper we investigate the masses and the kinetic mixing of hidden U(1)s in LARGE

hidden photons can be naturally light and that their kinetic mixing with the
ordinary electromagnetic photon can be of a size interesting for near future

technology that runs on natural gas and employs a molten salt electrolyte. In
order to keep the electrolyte in this state, the cell must be kept at a
temperature above 500 C, eliminating the need for precious metals as the
catalyst. There has been only a limited amount of research on modelling the
transport processes inside this device, mainly due to its restricted
applicability for mobile applications.
  In this work, three one-dimensional models of a MCFC cathode are presented
based on different types of diffusion and convection. Comparisons between
models are performed so as to assess their validity. Regarding ion transport,
it is shown that there exists a limiting case for ion migration across the
cathode that depends on the conductivity for the liquid potential. Finally, an
optimization of the diffusivity across the cathode is carried out in an attempt
to increase the cell performance and its longevity.

beta_z. By comparing the predicted second velocity moment to observed long-slit
stellar kinematics, we determine the three best-fitting parameters of the

able to accurately reproduce the wide range of observed stellar kinematics,
which typically extend to ~2-3 Re or, equivalently, ~0.5-1 R_25. We find a
median stellar mass-to-light ratio at Ks-band of 1.09 (solar units) with an rms
scatter of 0.31. We present preliminary comparisons between this large sample
of dynamically determined stellar mass-to-light ratios and the predictions of
stellar population models. The stellar population models predict slightly lower
mass-to-light ratios than we measure. The mass models contain a median of 15
per cent dark matter by mass within an effective radius Re, and 49 per cent

the mass within a sphere of radius 4.1 Re or 1.0 R_25. There is no evidence of

Our results reveal that graphene's field-oriented bending angle is roughly

bending stiffness and the longitudinal polarizability are also found to be
approximately proportional to the square of graphene length. Compared with

new procedure to remove striping artefacts from the raw HARP data is
introduced. We compare the maps to those of the dust continuum emission mapped
with SCUBA (Hatchell et al. 2005) and the positions of starless and
protostellar cores (Hatchell et al. 2007a). No straightforward correlation is
found between the masses of each region derived from the HARP CO and SCUBA

same object derived from different tracers. From the 13CO/C18O line ratio the
relative abundance of the two species ([13CO]/[C18O] ~ 7) and their opacities
(typically tau is 0.02-0.22 and 0.15-1.52 for the C18O and 13CO gas

increasing in opacity towards star-forming cores but not beyond tau(C18O)~0.9.
Assuming the 12CO gas is optically thick we compute its excitation temperature
(around 8-30 K), which has little correlation with estimates of the dust

truncation of a larger theory called log gravity by requiring that left-moving
charges vanish. In turn, log gravity is the limit of topologically massive
gravity (TMG) at a special value of the coupling (the chiral point). We study
the situation at the level of linearized quantum fields, focussing on a unitary
quantization. While the TMG Hilbert space is continuous at the chiral point,
the left-moving Virasoro generators become ill-defined and cannot be used to
define a chiral truncation. In a sense, the left-moving asymptotic symmetries
are spontaneously broken at the chiral point. In contrast, in a non-unitary
quantization of TMG, both the Hilbert space and charges are continuous at the
chiral point and define a unitary theory of chiral gravity at the linearized
level.

the best fits to the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys'

presence of either one or two separate axisymmetric dust disks. The density
models are analytical, radial two-power-laws joined smoothly at a cross-over
radius with density exponentially decreasing away from the mid-plane of the
disks. Two-disk models match the data best, yielding a reduced chi^2 of ~1.2.
Our two-disk model reproduces many of the asymmetries reported in the
literature and suggests that it is the secondary (tilted) disk which is largely
responsible for them. Our model suggests that the secondary disk is not
constrained to the inner regions of the system (extending out to at least 250
AU) and that it has a slightly larger total area of dust than the primary, as a
result of slower fall-off of density with radius and height. This surprising
result raises many questions about the origin and dynamics of such a pair of
disks. The disks overlap, but can coexist owing to their low optical depths and
therefore long mean collision times. We find that the two disks have dust
replenishment times on the order of 10^4 yr at ~100 AU, hinting at the presence
of planetesimals that are responsible for the production of 2nd generation
dust. A plausible conjecture, which needs to be confirmed by physical modeling
of the collisional dynamics of bodies in the disks, is that the two observed
disks are derived from underlying planetesimal disks; such disks would be
anchored by the gravitational influence of planets located at less than 70 AU
from beta Pic that are themselves in slightly inclined orbits.

bioinformatics programs used today. Applications range widely from comparative
gene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of
the underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example
the genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction
accuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus
key to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications.
  Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one
for Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM)
training, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence
length. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training
which require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one
step and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these
two new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM
training into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-Converter and examine their
respective practical merits for three small example models.
  Conclusions: Bioinformatics applications employing hidden Markov models can
use the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM
training more computationally efficient. Using these algorithms, parameter
training can thus be attempted for more complex models and longer training
sequences. The two new algorithms have the added advantage of being easier to
implement than the corresponding default algorithms for Viterbi training and
stochastic EM training.

semigroup (probabilistic) method is applicable to a more general class of

the analytic approach we establish a Borel theorem for p.c.f. fractals, showing
that to any prescribed jet at a junction point there is a smooth function with
that jet. As a consequence we prove that on p.c.f. fractals smooth functions
may be cut off with no loss of smoothness, and thus can be smoothly decomposed
subordinate to an open cover. The latter result provides a replacement for
classical partition of unity arguments in the p.c.f. fractal setting.

regions with significant upflow are associated with the funnel-like legs of
magnetic loops and co-spatial with increments of the line width. These
quasi-steady upflows can be regarded as the signatures of mass supply to
coronal loops. By using the square-root of the line intensity as a proxy for
the plasma density, the mass flux of the upflow in each funnel can be
estimated. We find that the mass flux is anti-correlated with the funnel's
expansion factor as determined from the extrapolated magnetic field. One of the
loop systems is associated with a coronal bright point, which was observed by
several instruments and exhibited various morphologies in different wavelengths
and viewing directions. A remarkable agreement between its magnetic structure
and the associated EUV emission pattern was found, suggesting an almost
potential-field nature of the coronal magnetic field. We also report the direct
detection of a small-scale siphon flow by both STEREO satellites. However, this
transient siphon flow occurred in a weak mixed-polarity-field region, which was
outside the adjacent magnetic funnel, and thus it is perhaps not related to
plasma upflow in the funnel. Based on these observations, we suggest that at
upper-TR temperatures the dominant flows in quiet-Sun coronal loops are
long-lasting upflows rather than siphon flows. We also discuss the implications
for coronal heating and unresolved magnetic structures.

softer colors suggesting a different type of source. In this paper, we further
study the properties of hard and soft sources by constructing color segregated
X-ray Luminosity Functions (XLF) for these two populations. Since the number of
sources in any given galaxy is small, we coadded sources from a sample of
nearby, face-on spiral galaxies observed by Chandra as a Large Project in Cycle
2. We use simulations to carefully correct the XLF for completeness. The
composite hard source XLF is not consistent with a single power-law fit. At
luminosities Lx>3E38 ergs/s it is well fit by a power law with a slope that is
consistent with that found for sources in elliptical galaxies by Kim and
Fabbiano 2004. This is supports the suggestion that the hard sources are
dominated by LMXBs. In contrast, the high luminosity XLF of soft sources has a
slope similar to the ``universal'' High Mass X-ray Binary XLF. Some of these
sources are stellar mass black-hole binaries accreting at high rates in a

recorded by the sequential movement of the sample with respect to the
microscope focus. Different layers of the surface of the sample appear in focus
in the different images in the series. The indexed series of the in-focus
portions of the sample surface is combined into one sharp 2D image and
interpolated into the 3D surface representing the surface of an original GDL

Remote Galaxy Survey (ERGS). The data is drawn from ten widely-separated fields
covering a total sky area of 275 arcmin squared. Starting with a simple colour
(R-I>1.3) and magnitude (I<26.3) cut to isolate the Lyman break and then
refining the sample by applying further optical and near-infrared photometric
criteria we identify a sample of 253 LBG candidates. We carefully model the
completeness of this sample and the factors that affect its reliability. There
is considerable overlap between this sample and a spectroscopically-confirmed
sample drawn from the same survey and this allows us to determine the
reliability of the optical photometric selection (~60 per cent) and to show
that the reliability can be significantly improved (to ~80 per cent) by
applying near-infrared waveband criteria to exclude very red contaminants. Even
this high level of reliability may compromise some statistical studies of LBG
properties. We show that over 30 per cent of the highest reliability candidates
have multiple UV-luminous components and/or disturbed morphology in HST
imaging, though it is unclear whether this represents multiple
interacting/merging sources or individual large sources with multiple UV bright
regions. Using this sample we confirm that the normalisation of the bright end
of the z=5 UV luminosity function (down to M*) is lower than the same at z=4 by
a factor of 3. Using a Schechter fit we determine M*uv=-20.9+/-0.2. We discuss
whether it is reasonable to expect the UV luminosity function to follow a
Schechter function, given the UV emission is short-lived and stochastic, and
does not necessarily trace the underlying mass of the galaxy.

production of some non-inflaton particles during inflation, for example via
parametric resonance or a phase transition. Particle production during
inflation leads to observables in the cosmological fluctuations, such as
features in the primordial power spectrum and also nongaussianities. Here we
focus on a prototype scenario with inflaton, \phi, and iso-inflaton, \chi,
fields interacting during inflation via the coupling g^2 (\phi-\phi_0)^2\chi^2.
Since several previous investigations have hinted at the presence of localized
""glitches"" in the observed primordial power spectrum, which are inconsistent
with the simplest power-law model, it is interesting to determine the extent to
which such anomalies can be explained by this simple and well-motivated model.
Our prototype scenario predicts a bump-like feature in the primordial power
spectrum, rather than an oscillatory ""ringing"" pattern as has previously been
assumed. We discuss the observational constraints on such features. We find
that bumps with amplitude as large as 10% of the usual scale invariant
fluctuations from inflation are allowed on scales relevant for Cosmic Microwave
Background experiments. Our results imply an upper limit on the coupling g^2
which is crucial for assessing the detectability of the nongaussianity produced
by inflationary particle production. We also discuss more complicated features
that result from superposing multiple instances of particle production.
Finally, we point to a number of microscopic realizations of this scenario in
string theory and supersymmetry and discuss the implications of our constraints
for the popular brane/axion monodromy inflation models.

the momentum dependence of the departure from equilibrium is not known {\it a

determined by the rate of radiative energy loss and is proportional to
$p_T^{3/2}$. The weaker $p_T$ dependence leads to straighter $v_2(p_T)$ curves

generally species dependent. A species dependent equilibration rate, with
baryons equilibrating faster than mesons, can explain ``constituent quark

scheduling along with per user rate and power loadings over orthogonal fading
channels, when both terminals and scheduler rely on quantized channel state
information. Channel-adaptive policies are designed to optimize an average
transmit-performance criterion subject to average quality of service
requirements. While the resultant optimal policy per fading realization shows
that the individual rate and power loadings can be obtained separately for each
user, the optimal scheduling is slightly more complicated. Specifically, per
fading realization each channel is allocated either to a single (winner) user,
or, to a small group of winner users whose percentage of shared resources is
found by solving a linear program. A single scheduling scheme combining both
alternatives becomes possible by smoothing the original disjoint scheme. The
smooth scheduling is asymptotically optimal and incurs reduced computational
complexity. Different alternatives to obtain the Lagrange multipliers required
to implement the channel-adaptive policies are proposed, including stochastic
iterations that are provably convergent and do not require knowledge of the

Languages in the sense of the latest evolutions of Lucid. This new hybrid
language combines the essential characteristics of Lucid and Java, and
introduces the notion of object streams which makes it is possible that each
element in a Lucid stream to be an object with embedded intensional properties.
Interestingly, this hybrid language also brings to Java objects the power to
explicitly express and manipulate the notion of context, creating the novel
concept of intensional object, i.e. objects whose evaluation is
context-dependent, which are here demonstrated to be translatable into standard

intensional objects and enrich the meaning of object streams in Lucid and

significantly larger than that predicted by classical radiative transfer

between two half--spaces or spheres treated in the dipole approximation (very
small sphere) or proximity force approximation (radius of sphere much greater
than the gap). Sphere--sphere or sphere--plane configurations beyond the dipole

work, the radiative energy transfer between two adjacent non--overlapping

small diameter (compared to the wavelength), the results coincide with the

valid for spheres with diameters much larger than the gap, even though this

Earth-size satellites around hot Jupiters may be immune to destruction by
orbital decay; detection of such a massive satellite would strongly constrain
theories of tidal dissipation in gas giants, in a manner complementary to
orbital circularization. The star's gravity induces significant periodic
eccentricity in the satellite's orbit. The resulting tidal heating rates, per
unit mass, are far in excess of Io's and dominate radioactive heating out to
planet orbital periods of months for reasonable satellite tidal $Q$. Inside
planet orbital periods of about a week, tidal heating can completely melt the
satellite. Lastly, we compute an upper limit to the satellite mass loss rate
due to thermal evaporation from the surface, valid if the satellite's
atmosphere is thin and vapor pressure is negligible. Using this upper limit, we
find that although rocky satellites around hot Jupiters with orbital periods
less than a few days can be significantly evaporated in their lifetimes,
detectable satellites suffer negligible mass loss at longer orbital periods.

second to measure the so-called large separation, third to estimate the
asteroseismic information that can be retrieved from the Fourier spectrum. We
develop in this paper a procedure, based on the autocorrelation of the seismic
Fourier spectrum. We have searched for criteria able to predict the output that
one can expect from the analysis by autocorrelation of a seismic time series.
First, the autocorrelation is properly scaled for taking into account the
contribution of white noise. Then, we use the null hypothesis H0 test to assess
the reliability of the autocorrelation analysis. Calculations based on solar
and CoRoT times series are performed in order to quantify the performance as a
function of the amplitude of the autocorrelation signal. We propose an
automated determination of the large separation, whose reliability is
quantified by the H0 test. We apply this method to analyze a large set of red
giants observed by CoRoT. We estimate the expected performance for photometric
time series of the Kepler mission. Finally, we demonstrate that the method
makes it possible to distinguish l=0 from l=1 modes. The envelope
autocorrelation function has proven to be very powerful for the determination
of the large separation in noisy asteroseismic data, since it enables us to
quantify the precision of the performance of different measurements: mean large
separation, variation of the large separation with frequency, small separation
and degree identification.

of how these objects form becomes important. The determination of their number
density and whether a mass cut-off limit exists is crucial to understanding
their formation. We propose to search for objects of yet lower masses in the
cluster and determine the shape of the mass function at low mass. Using new-
and (re-analysed) published IZJHKs[3.6]-[8.0]-band data of an area of 840
arcmin2, we performed a search for LT-type cluster member candidates in the
magnitude range J=19.5-21.5 mag, based on their expected magnitudes and
colours. Besides recovering the T type object S Ori 70 and two other known
objects, we find three new cluster member candidates, S Ori 72-74, with J=21
mag and within 12 arcmin of the cluster centre. They have theoretical masses of
4 (-2,+3) M_Jup and are among the least massive free-floating objects detected
by direct imaging outside the Solar System. The photometry in archival Spitzer
[3.6]-[5.8]-band images infers that S Ori 72 is an L/T transition candidate and
S Ori 73 a T-type candidate, following the expected cluster sequence in the
mid-infrared. Finally, the L-type candidate S Ori 74 with lower quality
photometry is located at 11.8 arcsec (~4250 AU) of a stellar member of sigma
Orionis and could be a companion. After contaminant correction in the area
complete to J=21.1 mag, we estimate that there remain between zero and two
cluster members in the mass interval 6-4 M_Jup. Our result suggests a possible
turnover in the substellar mass spectrum below ~6 Jupiter masses, which could
be investigated further by wider and deeper photometric surveys.

the original EPR argument in considering only two different measurement

non-vanishing even at 75 \AA{} and falls-off exponentially with a correlation
length of about 24 \AA{} beyond solvation region. Numerical evidence suggests
that the long range nature of dipole-dipole correlation is due to underlying

errors, or disturbances, are centred in a way that reflects particular
characteristics of the mechanism that generated the data. In economics this
occurs in problems involving data on markets, productivity and auctions, where
it can be natural to centre at an end-point of the error distribution rather
than at the distribution's mean. Often these cases have an extreme-value
character, and in that broader context, examples involving meteorological,
record-value and production-frontier data have been discussed in the
literature. We shall discuss nonparametric methods for estimating regression
curves in these settings, showing that they have features that contrast so
starkly with those in better understood problems that they lead to apparent
contradictions. For example, merely by centring errors at their end-points
rather than their means the problem can change from one with a familiar
nonparametric character, where the optimal convergence rate is slower than
$n^{-1/2}$, to one in the super-efficient class, where the optimal rate is
faster than $n^{-1/2}$. Moreover, when the errors are centred in a non-standard
way there is greater intrinsic interest in estimating characteristics of the
error distribution, as well as of the regression mean itself. The paper will
also address this aspect of the problem.

ratio of the scale factor to its value at the turnaround epoch and the ratio of
the overdensity radius to its value at the turnaround time with general
cosmological parameters. The exact solutions of the overdensity at the
turnaround epoch for the different models are also obtained. Thus, we are able
to obtain the nonlinear overdensity at any epoch for the given model. We obtain
that the nonlinear overdensity of the Einstein de Sitter Universe is 18
pi^2(fr{1}{2pi} + fr{3}{4})^2 ~ 147 instead of the well known value 18 pi^2 ~
178. In the open Universe, perturbations are virialized earlier than in flat
Universe and thus clusters are denser at the virial epoch. Also the critical
density threshold from the linear theory at the virialized epoch is obtained as
fr{3}{20} (9pi+6)^{fr{2}{3}} ~ 1.58 instead of fr{3}{20} (12pi)^{fr{2}{3}} ~
1.69. This value is same for the close and the open Universes. Because we
obtain the analytic forms of dynamical quantities, we are able to estimate the
abundances of both virialized and non-virialized clusters at any epoch. Also
the temperature and luminosity functions are able to be computed at any epoch.
Unfortunately, the current concordance model prefers the almost flat Universe
and the above results might be restricted by the academic interests only.
However, mathematical structure of the physical evolution equations of the
curved space is identical with that of the dark energy with the equation of
state w = -fr{1}{3}. Thus, we are able to extend these analytic solutions to
the general dark energy model and they will provide the useful tools for
probing the properties of dark energy.

remote spins through scattering of mobile mediators without initialization,
post-selection or feedback of the mediators' state. No time-resolved tuning is
needed and, counterintuitively, the protocol generates two-qubit singlet states
even when classical mediators are used. The mechanism responsible for such
effect is resilient against non-optimal coupling strengths and dephasing
affecting the spins. The scheme uses itinerant particles and scattering centres
and can be implemented in various settings. When quantum dots and photons are
used a striking result is found: injection of classical mediators, rather than
quantum ones, improves the scheme efficiency.

problem, we study the weak coupling limit of the nonlinear Landau-Zener
transition at coherent photo- and magneto-association of an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate. Using an exact third-order nonlinear differential
equation for the molecular state probability, we develop a variational approach
which enables us to construct an accurate analytic approximation describing
time dynamics of the coupled atom-molecular system for the case of weak
coupling. The approximation is written in terms of the solution to an auxiliary
linear Landau-Zener problem with some effective Landau-Zener parameter. The
dependence of this effective parameter on the input Landau-Zener parameter is
found to be unexpected: as the generic Landau-Zener parameter increases, the
effective Landau-Zener parameter first monotonically increases (starting from
zero), reaches its maximal value and then monotonically decreases again
reaching zero at some point. The constructed approximation quantitatively well
describes many characteristics of the time dynamics of the system, in
particular, it provides a highly accurate formula for the final transition
probability to the molecular state. The present result for the final transition
probability improves the accuracy of the previous approximation by Ishkhanyan

enable the plasma to cross the magnetic separatrices also inside the current

topological and geometrical skeleton of the resistive MHD fields. We therefore
have to perform a local analysis of almost all non-ideal MHD solutions with a
generalized non-idealness. We use Taylor expansions of the magnetic field, the

the flow close to the magnetic X-point is also of X-point type to guarantee

photometric survey with spectroscopic follow-up covers 11 square degrees,
making it the largest survey of this cluster to date. We observe a radial
variation in the mass function over the range 0.072 to 0.3Msol, but no
significant variation in the mass function below the substellar boundary at the
three cluster radius intervals analyzed. This lack of radial variation for low
masses is what we would expect with the ejection scenario for brown dwarf
formation, although considering that IC2391 has an age about three times older
than its crossing time, we expect that brown dwarfs with a velocity greater
than the escape velocity have already escaped the cluster. Alternatively, the
variation in the mass function of the stellar objects could be an indication
that they have undergone mass segregation via dynamical evolution. We also
observe a significant variation across the cluster in the colour of the
(background) field star locus in colour-magnitude diagrams and conclude that
this is due to variable background extinction in the Galactic plane. From our
preliminary spectroscopic follow-up to confirm brown dwarf status and cluster
membership, we find that all candidates are M dwarfs (in either the field or
the cluster), demonstrating the efficiency of our photometric selection method
in avoiding contaminants (e.g. red giants). About half of our photometric

problem in MCMC implementation. Criteria for scaling based on empirical
acceptance rates of algorithms have been found to work consistently well across
a broad range of problems. Essentially, proposal jump sizes are increased when
acceptance rates are high and decreased when rates are low. In recent years,
considerable theoretical support has been given for rules of this type which
work on the basis that acceptance rates around 0.234 should be preferred. This
has been based on asymptotic results that approximate high dimensional
algorithm trajectories by diffusions. In this paper, we develop a novel
approach to understanding 0.234 which avoids the need for diffusion limits. We
derive explicit formulae for algorithm efficiency and acceptance rates as
functions of the scaling parameter. We apply these to the family of
elliptically symmetric target densities, where further illuminating explicit
results are possible. Under suitable conditions, we verify the 0.234 rule for a
new class of target densities. Moreover, we can characterise cases where 0.234
fails to hold, either because the target density is too diffuse in a sense we
make precise, or because the eccentricity of the target density is too severe,
again in a sense we make precise. We provide numerical verifications of our
results.

$10^3M_\odot$. If born in large numbers, such massive stars can have strong
impact on the subsequent star formation, producing strong ionising radiation
and contaminating the primordial gas with heavy elements. They would leave
behind massive black holes that could act as seeds for growing supermassive
black holes of active galactic nuclei. Given the anticipated fast rotation,
such stars would end their live as supermassive collapsars and drive powerful
magnetically-dominated jets. In this letter we investigate the possibility of
observing the bursts of high-energy emission similar to the Long Gamma Ray
Bursts associated with normal collapsars. We show that during the collapse of
supercollapsars, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can produce jets as powerful as
few$\times10^{52}$erg/s and release up to $10^{54}$erg of the black hole
rotational energy. Due to the higher intrinsic time scale and higher redshift
the initial bright phase of the burst can last for about $10^4$ seconds,
whereas the central engine would remain active for about one day. Due to the
high redshift the burst spectrum is expected to be soft, with the spectral
energy distribution peaking at around 20-30keV. The peak total flux density is
relatively low, $10^{-7}{erg} {cm}^{-2} {s}^{-1}$, but not prohibitive. If one
supercollapsar is produced per every mini-halo of dark matter arising from the
3-$\sigma$ cosmological fluctuations then the whole sky frequency of such

transition which is described by two complex FCNC parameters $F_{23}$ and
$F_{32}$ and parameters in the Higgs sector. Model independent constraints on
these parameters are derived from the $B_S-\bar{B}_s$ mixing and are used to
predict the branching ratios for $\bar{B}_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ and $\bar{B}_d\to
\bar{K}\mu^+\mu^-$ numerically by considering general variations in the Higgs
parameters assuming that Higgs sector conserves CP. Taking the results on
$B_{s}^0-\bar{B}_{s}^0$ mixing derived by the global analysis of UTfit group as
a guide we present the general constraints on $F_{23}^*F_{32}$ in terms of the
pseudo-scalar mass $M_A$. The former is required to be in the range $\sim (1-5)
\times 10^{-11} M_A^2 {\rm GeV}^{-2}$ if the Higgs induced FCNC represent the
dominant source of new physics. The phases of these couplings can account for
the large CP violating phase in the $B_{s}^0-\bar{B}_{s}^0$ mixing except when
$F_{23}=F_{32}$. The Higgs contribution to $\bar{B}_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ branching
ratio can be large, close to the present limit while it remains close to the
standard model value in case of the process $\bar{B}_d\to \bar{K}\mu^+\mu^-$

We demonstrate that, to achieve the high entropy levels found in clusters,
active galactic nuclei must inject a large fraction of their energy into the

of valve and actuator guidance parts. While estimating the axial load is
straight forward, estimating and/or measuring the side load is more difficult,
especially for globe valves. Therefore, measurements are carried out on an ad
hoc, scale 1, model of a 2"" globe valve. The body is replicated in Plexiglas to
enable flow visualization and the original stem is heavily instrumented to
allow force measurements in every direction. The flow loop facility used for
this experiment is designed to allow fine-tuning of the cavitation intensity.
The experiment is run for a set of cavitation conditions, flow rates and disc
positions. The results show that the transverse force (perpendicular to the
stem) can reach the order of the axial force; thus it should not be ignored. We
also observed that it depends very weakly on the cavitation levels. Videos made
with a high-speed camera allow an interesting understanding of the fluid flow
and the cavitation creation. Moreover, CFD simulations of this experiment,
limited to the single phase flow are compared to the experiments. Through the
experimental testing, visual observations, and computational predictions, the
role of the cavitation on the fluid forces is better understood.

massive stars may represent our best signposts of individual objects in the

which might originate from the progenitor's rapid rotation and associated
asymmetry. To obtain empirical constraints on the interplay between stellar
rotation and wind asymmetry, we perform linear Halpha spectropolarimetry on a
sample of 18 spectroscopically peculiar massive O stars, including OVz, Of?p,
Oe, and Onfp stars, supplemented by an earlier sample of 20 O supergiants.
Despite their rapid rotation (with vsin(i) up to 400 km/s) most O-type stars
are found to be spherically symmetric, but with notable exceptions amongst
specific object classes. We divide the peculiar O stars into four distinct
categories: Groups III and IV include the Oe stars and Onfp stars, which are on
the high-end tail of the O star rotation distribution and have in the past been
claimed to be embedded in disks. Here we report the detection of a classical
depolarization ``line effect'' in the Oe star HD 45314, but the overall
incidence of line effects amongst Oe stars is significantly lower (1 out of 6)
than amongst Be stars. The chance that the Oe and Be datasets are drawn from
the same parent population is negligible (with 95% confidence). This implies
there is as yet no evidence for a disk hypothesis in Oe stars, providing
relevant constraints on the physical mechanism that is responsible for the Be
phenomenon. Finally, we find that 3 out of 4 of the group IV Onfp stars show
evidence for complex polarization effects, which are likely related to rapid
rotation, and we speculate on the evolutionary links to B[e] stars.

the spacetime events which respects the notion of causal precedence. The
problem of the existence of a (semi-)time function on spacetime and the problem
of recovering the causal structure starting from the set of time functions are
studied. It is pointed out that these problems have an analog in the field of
microeconomics known as utility theory. In a chronological spacetime the
semi-time functions correspond to the utilities for the chronological relation,
while in a K-causal (stably causal) spacetime the time functions correspond to
the utilities for the K^+ relation (Seifert's relation). By exploiting this
analogy, we are able to import some mathematical results, most notably Peleg's
and Levin's theorems, to the spacetime framework. As a consequence, we prove
that a K-causal (i.e. stably causal) spacetime admits a time function and that
the time or temporal functions can be used to recover the K^+ (or Seifert)
relation which indeed turns out to be the intersection of the time or temporal
orderings. This result tells us in which circumstances it is possible to
recover the chronological or causal relation starting from the set of time or
temporal functions allowed by the spacetime. Moreover, it is proved that a
chronological spacetime in which the closure of the causal relation is
transitive (for instance a reflective spacetime) admits a semi-time function.
Along the way a new proof avoiding smoothing techniques is given that the
existence of a time function implies stable causality, and a new short proof of
the equivalence between K-causality and stable causality is given which takes
advantage of Levin's theorem and smoothing techniques.

out-of-plane incident X-ray momentum) are dominated by off-site transitions and
intersite hybridization. This demonstrates the relevance of approaches beyond
the single-site model for the description of the pre-edges of correlated
materials. Finally, we show the occurrence of a doubling of the main edge peak
that is most visible when the polarization is along the c-axis. This doubling,
that has not been seen in any previous absorption data in cuprates, is not
reproduced by first principles calculations. We suggest that this peak is due
to many-body charge-transfer excitations, while all the other visible far-edge
structures are single particle in origin. Our work indicates that previous

gravitomagnetic corrections considered in relativistic theory of orbits. Beside
the standard periastron effect of General Relativity, new nutation effects come
out when c^{-3} corrections are taken into account. Such corrections emerge as
soon as matter-current densities and vector gravitational potentials cannot be
discarded into dynamics. We study the gravitational waves emitted through the
capture, in the gravitational field of massive binary systems (e.g. a very
massive black hole on which a stellar object is inspiralling) via the
quadrupole approximation, considering precession and nutation effects. We
present a numerical study to obtain the gravitational wave luminosity, the
total energy output and the gravitational radiation amplitude. From a crude
estimate of the expected number of events towards peculiar targets (e.g.
globular clusters) and in particular, the rate of events per year for dense
stellar clusters at the Galactic Center (SgrA*), we conclude that this type of
capture could give signatures to be revealed by interferometric GW antennas, in
particular by the forthcoming laser interferometer space antenna LISA.

composition on reaction kinetics (the ""mixing effect"") and the effects of
pressure (both in relationship to temperature and time). The extrapolation of
experimental data to geological conditions requires investigation of the
free-radical reaction mechanisms through a computed kinetic model. We propose a

continuously improved by addition of new reactants as research proceeds. This

in the region does not arise solely from incompleteness owing to extinction. A
hybrid spiral map of the Galaxy comprised of classical Cepheids, young open

the Milky Way and confirms that the three Cepheids do not populate the main

are found to deviate from the canonical logarithmic spiral pattern. Revised

illuminated by X-rays in astrophysical sources is nontrivial to calculate

scattering. We characterize the Fe Kalpha line flux using a dimensionless
efficiency, defined as the fraction of continuum photons above the Fe K shell
absorption edge threshold energy that appear in the line. The optically-thin
approximation begins to break down even for column densities as small as 2 x
10^22 cm^-2. We show how to obtain reliable estimates of the Fe Kalpha line
efficiency in the case of cold, neutral matter, even for the Compton-thick
regime. We find that, regardless of geometry and covering factor, the largest
Fe Kalpha line efficiency is attained well before the medium becomes
Compton-thick. For cosmic elemental abundances it is difficult to achieve an
efficiency higher than a few percent under the most favorable conditions and
lines of sight. For a given geometry, Compton-thick lines-of-sight may have Fe
Kalpha line efficiencies that are orders of magnitude less than the maximum
possible for that geometry. Configurations that allow unobscured views of a
Compton-thick reflecting surface are capable of yielding the highest
efficiencies. Our results can be used to estimate the predicted flux of the
narrow Fe Kalpha line at ~6.4 keV from absorption models in AGN. In particular
we show that contrary to a recent claim in the literature, absorption dominated
models for the relativistic Fe Kalpha emission line in MCG -6-30-15 do not
over-predict the narrow Fe Kalpha line for any column density or covering

thermal expansion at the different phase transitions. The magnetic

the lowest crystal electric field doublet having a dominant Gamma_6 character.
Curie-Weiss like susceptibilities for magnetic field parallel and perpendicular
to the crystallographic c-axis do not reveal an influence of a staggered field
on the Ce site induced by magnetic ordering of the Fe. Furthermore, the
standard signatures for antiferromagnetic order of Ce at T_N = 3.7 K observed
in chi(T) and C(T) are incompatible with a Zeeman splitting Delta = 10 K of the
CEF ground state doublet at low temperature due to the Fe-magnetic order as
previously proposed. Our results can be reconciled with the earlier observation
by assuming a comparatively stronger effect of the Ce-Ce exchange leading to a
reduction of this Zeeman splitting below 15 K.

we demonstrated that the entanglement of the reduced two-particle state,
reconstructed from measurements of average currents and current cross
