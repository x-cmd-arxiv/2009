parameters are often introduced. Here we propose a time-independent procedure
based on quantum tomography to reconstruct the potentially unknown parameters
of a wide class of Markovian master equations. According to our scheme, the
system under investigation is initially prepared in a Gaussian state. At an
arbitrary time t, in order to retrieve the unknown coefficients one needs to
measure only a finite number (ten at maximum) of points along three
time-independent tomograms. Due to the limited amount of measurements required,
we expect our proposal to be especially suitable for experimental
implementations.

NASA/Ames Intelligent Systems Div. (2002) which is a Bayesian, finite mixture
model classification system developed by Cheeseman and Stutz (1996). We apply
this system to Mount Wilson Solar Observatory (MWO) intensity and magnetogram
images and classify individual pixels on the solar surface to calculate daily
indices that are then correlated with total solar irradiance (TSI) to yield a
set of regression coefficients. This approach allows us to model the TSI with a
correlation of better than 0.96 for the period 1996 to 2007. These regression
coefficients applied to classified pixels on the observed solar surface allow
the construction of images of the Sun as it would be seen by TSI measuring
instruments like the Solar Bolometric Imager recently flown by Foukal et al.,
(2004). As a consequence of the very high correlation we achieve in reproducing
the TSI record, our approach holds out the possibility of creating an on-going,
accurate, independent estimate of TSI variations fromground-based observations
which could be used to compare, and identify the sources of disagreement among,
TSI observations from the various satellite instruments and to fill in gaps in
the satellite record. Further, our spatially-resolved images should assist in
characterizing the particular solar surface regions associated with TSI
variations. Also, since the particular set of MWO data on which this analysis
is based is available on a daily basis back to at least 1985, and on an
intermittent basis before then, it will be possible to estimate the TSI
emission due to identified solar surface features at several solar minima to
constrain the role surface magnetic effects have on long-term trends in solar
energy output.

use a global structured metapopulation model integrating mobility and
transportation data worldwide in order to estimate the transmission potential
and the relevant model parameters we used the data on the chronology of the
2009 novel influenza A(H1N1). The method is based on the maximum likelihood
analysis of the arrival time distribution generated by the model in 12
countries seeded by Mexico by using 1M computationally simulated epidemics. An
extended chronology including 93 countries worldwide seeded before 18 June was
used to ascertain the seasonality effects. We found the best estimate R0 = 1.75
(95% CI 1.64 to 1.88) for the basic reproductive number. Correlation analysis
allows the selection of the most probable seasonal behavior based on the
observed pattern, leading to the identification of plausible scenarios for the
future unfolding of the pandemic and the estimate of pandemic activity peaks in
the different hemispheres. We provide estimates for the number of
hospitalizations and the attack rate for the next wave as well as an extensive
sensitivity analysis on the disease parameter values. We also studied the
effect of systematic therapeutic use of antiviral drugs on the epidemic
timeline. The analysis shows the potential for an early epidemic peak occurring
in October/November in the Northern hemisphere, likely before large-scale
vaccination campaigns could be carried out. We suggest that the planning of
additional mitigation policies such as systematic antiviral treatments might be
the key to delay the activity peak inorder to restore the effectiveness of the
vaccination programs.

surface by force applied to the end segment, it undergoes a first-order
thermodynamic phase transition albeit without phase coexistence. This unusual
feature is demonstrated analytically by means of a Grand Canonical Ensemble
(GCE) description of adsorbed macromolecules as well as by Monte Carlo
simulations of an off-lattice bead-spring model of a polymer chain. Theoretical
treatment and computer experiment can be carried out both in the constant-force
f statistical ensemble and in the constant-height h ensemble. We find that the
force-assisted desorption undergoes a first-order dichotomic phase transition
whereby phase coexistence between adsorbed and desorbed states does not exist.
In the f-ensemble the order parameter (the fraction of chain contacts with the
surface) is characterized by huge fluctuations when the pulling force attains a
critical value f_D. In the h-ensemble, in contrast, fluctuations are always
finite at the critical height h_D. The derived analytical expressions for the
probability distributions of the basic structural units of an adsorbed polymer,
such as loops, trains and tails, in terms of the adhesive potential and f or h,
provide a full description of the polymer structure and behavior upon
force-assisted detachment. In addition, one finds that the hitherto
controversial value of the universal critical adsorption exponent \phi depends
essentially on the extent of interaction between the loops adsorbed chain so
that \phi may vary within the limits 0.39 < \phi < 0.59.

this article, we consider the mechanics of pure shape and not scale of 4
particles on a line, so that the only physically significant quantities are
ratios of relative separations between the constituents' physical objects. Many
of our ideas and workings extend to the N-particle case. As such models'
configurations resemble depictions of metro lines in public transport maps, we
term them `N-stop metrolands'. This 4-stop model's configuration space is a
2-sphere, from which our metroland mechanics interpretation is via the `cubic'
tessellation. This model yields conserved quantities which are mathematically
SO(3) objects like angular momenta but are physically relative dilational
momenta (i.e. coordinates dotted with momenta). We provide and interpret
various exact and approximate classical and quantum solutions for 4-stop
metroland; from these results one can construct expectations and spreads of
shape operators that admit interpretations as relative sizes and the
`homogeneity of the model universe's contents', and also objects of
significance for the problem of time in quantum gravity (e.g. in the naive
Schrodinger and records theory timeless approaches).

the interstellar medium (ISM), the tenuous gas and plasma between the stars.
Previously known dispersive properties of the ISM cause low frequency pulses to
be delayed in time with respect to high frequency ones. This effect can be
explained by the presence of free electrons in the medium. The ISM also
contains neutral hydrogen which has a well known resonance at 1420.4 MHz.
Electro-magnetic theory predicts that at such a resonance, the induced
dispersive effects will be drastically different from those of the free
electrons. Pulses traveling through a cloud of neutral hydrogen should undergo
""anomalous dispersion"", which causes the group velocity of the medium to be
larger than the speed of light in vacuum. This superluminal group velocity
causes pulses containing frequencies near the resonance to arrive earlier in
time with respect to other pulses. Hence, these pulses appear to travel faster
than light. This phenomenon is caused by an interplay between the time scales
present in the pulse and the time scales present in the medium. Although
counter-intuitive, it does not violate the laws of special relativity. Here, we
present Arecibo observations of the radio pulsar PSR B1937+21 that show clear
evidence of anomalous dispersion. Though this effect is known in laboratory
physics, this is the first time it has been directly observed in an
astrophysical context, and it has the potential to be a useful tool for
studying the properties of neutral hydrogen in the Galaxy.

separate radiation code that, for the first time, links a parametrisation of
the microphysics of shock acceleration, synchrotron self-absorption and
electron cooling to a high-performance hydrodynamics simulation. For the
dynamics we find that the transition to the nonrelativistic regime generally
occurs later than expected, that the Sedov-Taylor solution overpredicts the
late time blast wave radius and that the analytical formula for the blast wave
velocity from Huang (1999) overpredicts the late time velocity by a factor 4/3.
For the radiation we find that the flux may differ up to an order of magnitude
depending on the equation of state that is used for the fluid and that the
counterjet leads to a clear rebrightening at late times for hard-edged jets.
Simulating GRB030329 using predictions for its physical parameters from the

the actual data, emphasizing the need for very accurate modelling. Predicted
light curves at low radio frequencies for a hard-edged jet model of GRB030329

that overcome the weak selection constraints needed for tractability in prior
studies of multilocus event models. A multivariate form of the reduction
principle is found: reduction results at individual loci combine topologically
to produce a surface of mutation rate alterations that are neutral for a new
modifier allele. New mutation rates survive if and only if they fall below this
surface - a generalization of the hyperplane found by Zhivotovsky et al. (1994)
for a multilocus recombination modifier. Increases in mutation rates at some
loci may evolve if compensated for by decreases at other loci. The strength of
selection on the modifier scales in proportion to the number of germline cell
divisions, and increases with the number of loci affected. Loci that do not
make a difference to marginal fitnesses at equilibrium are not subject to the
reduction principle, and under fine tuning of mutation rates would be expected
to have higher mutation rates than loci in mutation-selection balance. Other
results include the nonexistence of 'viability analogous, Hardy-Weinberg'
modifier polymorphisms under multiplicative mutation, and the sufficiency of
average transmission rates to encapsulate the effect of modifier polymorphisms
on the transmission of loci under selection. A conjecture is offered regarding
situations, like recombination in the presence of mutation, that exhibit
departures from the reduction principle. Constraints for tractability are:
tight linkage of all loci, initial fixation at the modifier locus, and mutation
distributions comprising transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains.

a large model of vitreous silica using only the silicon atoms and rescaling the

damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at redshifts $0.09 < z < 3.45$. The

high $T_s$ values found in DLAs do not arise from differences between the
optical and radio sightlines, but are likely to reflect the underlying gas
temperature distribution. The trend between $T_s$ and [Z/H] can be explained by
the larger number of radiation pathways for gas cooling in galaxies with high
metal abundances, resulting in a high cold gas fraction, and hence, a low spin
temperature. Conversely, low-metallicity galaxies have fewer cooling routes,
yielding a larger warm gas fraction and a high $T_s$. Most DLAs at $z>1.7$ have
low metallicities, [Z/H] $< -1$, implying that the HI in high-$z$ DLAs is
predominantly warm. The anti-correlation between $T_s$ and [Z/H] is consistent
with the presence of a mass-metallicity relation in DLAs, suggested by the
tight correlation between DLA metallicity and the kinematic widths of metal
lines. Most high-$z$ DLAs are likely to arise in galaxies with low masses
($M_{\rm vir} < 10^{10.5} M_\odot$), low metallicities ([Z/H]$< -1$, and low

motion under a constant shear stress and its recovery motion after removing the

the creep/recovery problem, the delayed elastic deformation in the creep motion
and evident elastic behavior in the recovery motion are demonstrated. The
velocity profiles of the melt in pressure-driven flows are quite different from
those of Newtonian fluid due to shear thinning. Velocity gradients of the melt
become steeper near the plates and flatter at the middle between the plates as
the pressure gradient increases and the temperature decreases. In the rapidly
oscillating plates, the viscous boundary layer of the melt is much thinner than
that of Newtonian fluid due to the shear thinning of the melt. Three different
rheological regimes, i.e., the viscous fluid, visco-elastic liquid, and
visco-elastic solid regimes, form over the oscillating plate according to the
local Deborah numbers. The melt behaves as a viscous fluid in a region for
$\omega\tau^R\lesssim 1$, and the crossover between the liquid-like and
solid-like regime takes place around $\omega\tau^\alpha\simeq 1$ (where
$\omega$ is the angular frequency of the plate and $\tau^R$ and $\tau^\alpha$

maintaining the divergence constraint in the numerical solution of the
equations of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) using the Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We derive a self-consistent formulation of the
equations of motion using a variational principle that is constrained by the
numerical formulation of both the induction equation and the curl operator used
to obtain the magnetic field, which guarantees exact and simultaneous
conservation of momentum, energy and entropy in the numerical scheme. This
leads to a novel formulation of the MHD force term, unique to the vector
potential, which differs from previous formulations. We also demonstrate how
dissipative terms can be correctly formulated for the vector potential such
that the contribution to the entropy is positive definite and the total energy
is conserved.
  On a standard suite of numerical tests in one, two and three dimensions we
find firstly that the consistent formulation of the vector potential equations
is unstable to the well-known SPH tensile instability, even more so than in the
standard Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics (SPMHD) formulation where the
magnetic field is evolved directly. Furthermore we find that, whilst a hybrid
approach based on the vector potential evolution equation coupled with a
standard force term gives good results for one and two dimensional problems
(where dAz/dt = 0), such an approach suffers from numerical instability in
three dimensions related to the unconstrained evolution of vector potential
components. We conclude that use of the vector potential is not a viable
approach for Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics.

form to the original FNH, which allows one to study in a simpler setting the
issues raised recently regarding the field theoretical approaches to glass
forming liquids. We study the effects of density nonlinearities on the time
evolution of correlation and response functions by developing field theoretic
formulations in two different ways: first by following the original
prescription of DM and then by constructing a dynamical action which possesses
a linear time reversal symmetry as proposed recently. We show explicitly that,
at the one-loop order of the perturbation theory, the DM-type field theory does
not support a sharp ergodic-nonergodic transition, while the other admits one.
The simple nature of the toy model in the DM formulation allows us to develop

photosensitive gaseous detector filled with Ne and ethylferrocene vapours at a
total pressure of 1 atm for an early forest fire detection system. Tests show
that it is one hundred times more sensitive than the best commercial
ultraviolet flame detectors and therefore, it is able to reliably detect a
flame of 1.5x1.5x1.5 m3 at a distance of about 1km. An additional and unique
feature of this detector is its imaging capability, which in combination with
other techniques, may significantly reduce false fire alarms when operating in
an automatic mode.
  Preliminary results conducted with air filled photosensitive gaseous
detectors are also presented. The approach main advantages include both the
simplicity of manufacturing and affordability of construction materials such as
plastics and glues specifically reducing detector production cost. The
sensitivity of these air filled detectors at certain conditions may be as high
as those filled with Ne and EF. Long term test results of such sealed detectors
indicate a significant progress in this direction.
  We believe that our detectors utilized in addition to other flame and smoke
sensors will exceptionally increase the sensitivity of forest fire detection
systems. Our future efforts will be focused on attempts to commercialize such
detectors utilizing our aforementioned findings.

to knowledge creation. Recent studies have shown that scientists can benefit
from their position within collaborative networks by being able to receive more
information of better quality in a timely fashion, and by presiding over
communication between collaborators. Here we focus on the tendency of
scientists to cluster into tightly-knit communities, and discuss the
implications of this tendency for scientific performance. We begin by reviewing
a new method for finding communities, and we then assess its benefits in terms
of computation time and accuracy. While communities often serve as a taxonomic
scheme to map knowledge domains, they also affect how successfully scientists
engage in the creation of new knowledge. By drawing on the longstanding debate
on the relative benefits of social cohesion and brokerage, we discuss the
conditions that facilitate collaborations among scientists within or across
communities. We show that successful scientific production occurs within
communities when scientists have cohesive collaborations with others from the
same knowledge domain, and across communities when scientists intermediate
among otherwise disconnected collaborators from different knowledge domains. We
also discuss the implications of communities for information diffusion, and
show how traditional epidemiological approaches need to be refined to take
knowledge heterogeneity into account and preserve the system's ability to
promote creative processes of novel recombinations of ideas

Spectrum, used for detecting and characterising the temporal changes of

data as well as archived observations made with the WSRT at wavelengths of 92
and 21 cm. The drifting subpulse phenomenon is a well known property of radio
pulsars. However the properties of the temporal behaviour of drifting subpulses
are not fully explored. The drifting can also be non-coherent and the presence
of effects like nulling or drift rate changing can mask the drifting behaviour
of the pulsar. The S2DFS is a robust method for investigating this phenomenon
and by introducing it we aim to expand our knowledge of the temporal drifting
subpulse properties. Our new analysis method uses horizonally collapsed
fluctuation spectra obtained with the Two-Dimensional Fluctuation Spectrum
method. Stacking the collapsed spectra obtained in a 256 pulse window which
slides by a pulse at a time produces a map of the collapsed fluctuation
spectrum. By analysing the maps one can easily determine the presence of any
temporal drift changes. Simulated data showed that the technique can reveal the
presence of any temporal changes in drift behaviour like mode changing or
nulling. We have also analysed data of three pulsars, PSRs B0031-07, B1819-22

known drift properties. All three sources are known to exhibit mode changes
which could easily be seen in the S2DFS. The results from the analysis of the

complimentary to the 2DFS method in detecting and characterising the temporal

constant stretching force is examined using a model for a Beta-barrel. For a
wide range of forces, the unfolding dynamics can be treated as one-dimensional
diffusion, parametrized in terms of the end-to-end distance. In particular, the
escape times can be evaluated as first passage times for a Brownian particle
moving on the protein free-energy landscape, using the Smoluchowski equation.
At strong forces, the unfolding process can be viewed as a diffusive drift away
from the native state, while at weak forces thermal activation is the relevant
mechanism. An escape-time analysis within this approach reveals a crossover
from an exponential to an inverse Gaussian escape-time distribution upon

enabling us to conclude that it is not possible to confirm the presence of any

investigate the effect of model uncertainties on our ability to reliably
recover a planetary signal. The use of incorrect temperature, model opacity
wavelengths and model temperature-pressure profiles have important consequences
for the least squares deconvolution procedure that we use to boost the S/N
ratio in our spectral timeseries observations. We find that mismatches between

information about emission from BP Cru in other bands than X-rays and optical
has been reported to date in the literature, though massive X-ray binaries
containing black holes can have radio emission from a jet. In order to assess
the presence of a radio jet, we searched for radio emission towards BP Cru
using the Australia Compact Array Telescope during a survey for radio emission
from Be/X-ray transients. We probed the 41.5d orbit of BP Cru with the
Australia Telescope Compact Array not only close to periastron but also close
to apastron. BP Cru was clearly detected in our data on 4, possibly 6, of 12
occasions at 4.8 and 8.6 GHz. Our data suggest that the spectral index of the
radio emission is modulated either by the X-ray flux or the orbital phase of
the system. We propose that the radio emission of BP Cru probably arises from
two components: a persistent component, coming from the mass donor Wray 977,
and a periodic component connected to the accretion onto the neutron star,
possibly coming from a (weak and short lived) jet.

  Methods. Our work is based on a extensive cross-identification of sources
from different wavelength catalogues and databases.
  Results. As a first result, we report the finding of a few counterpart
candidates inside the 95% confidence error box of the Fermi LAT unidentified
gamma-ray source 0FGL J1848.6$-$0138. The globular cluster GLIMPSE-C01
remarkably stands out among the most peculiar objects consistent with the
position uncertainty of the gamma-ray source and with a conceivable physical
scenario for gamma-ray production. The Fermi observed spectrum is compared
against theoretical predictions in the literature making the association
plausible but not yet certain due to its low X-ray to gamma-ray luminosity
ratio. Other competing counterparts are also discussed. In particular, we pay a
special attention to a possible Pulsar Wind Nebula inside the Fermi error box
whose nature is yet to be confirmed.
  Conclusions.Both a globular cluster and an infrared source resembling a
Pulsar Wind Nebula have been found in positional agreement with 0FGL
J1848.6$-$0138. In addition, other interesting objects in the field are also
reported. Future gamma-ray observations will narrow the position uncertainty
and we hope to eventually confirm one of the counterpart candidates reported
here. If GLIMPSE-C01 is confirmed, together with the Fermi possible detection
of the well known globular cluster 47 Tuc, then it would provide strong support
to theoretical predictions of globular clusters as gamma-ray sources.

the surface of a microdomain can regulate cellular signaling. When the ligand
switches between various states induced by chemical interactions or
conformational changes, while target activation occurs in only one state, this
activation time is affected. We investigate this dynamics using new equations
for the sojourn times spent in each state. For two states, we obtain exact
solutions in dimension one, and asymptotic ones confirmed by Brownian
simulations in dimension 3. We find that the activation time is quite sensitive
to changes of the switching rates, which can be used to modulate signaling.
Interestingly, our analysis reveals that activation can be fast although the
ligand spends most of the time 'hidden' in the non-activating state. Finally,
we obtain a new formula for the narrow escape time in the presence of
switching.

identities. We first present the diagrammatic formulation of the technique in
QCD, deriving at one loop the gauge independent gluon self-energy, quark-gluon
vertex, and three-gluon vertex, together with their Abelian Ward identities.
The generalization to theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking is carried
out in detail, and the connection with the optical theorem and the dispersion
relations are explained within the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.
The equivalence between the PT and the Feynman gauge of the Background Field
Method (BFM) is elaborated, and the crucial differences between the two methods
are critically scrutinized. The Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization method and the
general formalism of algebraic renormalization are introduced, and the
all-order generalization of the PT is thoroughly examined. The extension of the
PT to the non-perturbative domain of the QCD Schwinger-Dyson equations is
presented systematically, and the main advantages of the resulting
self-consistent truncation scheme are discussed. A plethora of physical
applications relying on the PT are reviewed, such as the definition of
gauge-independent off-shell form-factors, the construction of non-Abelian
effective charges, the gauge-invariant treatment of resonant transition
amplitudes and unstable particles, and the dynamical generation of an effective
gluon mass.

control problems in spite of the complexity of the plant and the significant
delays in sensory feedback . Such delays are expected to lead to non trivial
stability issues and lack of robustness of control solutions. However, such
difficulties are not observed in biological systems under normal operating
conditions. Based on early suggestions in the control literature, a possible
solution to this conundrum has been the suggestion that the motor system
contains within itself a forward model of the plant (e.g., the arm), which
allows the system to `simulate' and predict the effect of applying a control
signal. In this work we formally define the notion of a forward model for
deterministic control problems, and provide simple conditions that imply its
existence for tasks involving delayed feedback control. As opposed to previous
work which dealt mostly with linear plants and quadratic cost functions, our
results apply to rather generic control systems, showing that any controller
(biological or otherwise) which solves a set of tasks, \emph{must} contain
within itself a forward plant model. We suggest that our results provide strong
theoretical support for the necessity of forward models in many delayed control
problems, implying that they are not only useful, but rather, mandatory, under
general conditions.

asteroseismology or dynamical methods, for which it is often difficult to
obtain the necessary data from observations. We intend to find an approach to
deriving the masses of hot subdwarfs from observational data in the literature.
We presented full evolutionary calculations for hot subdwarfs in a wide mass
range (0.33 $M_\odot$ to 1.4 $M_\odot$) for a Population I metallicity of
$Z$=0.02, and obtained a relation between $M_{\rm p}$ and $\log (\frac{T_{\rm
eff}^4}{g})$, where $M_{\rm p}$, $T_{\rm eff}$, and $g$ are the most probable
mass, effective temperature, and gravity. This relation is used to study the
masses of some observed hot subdwarfs. We proposed a method of determining the
masses of hot subdwarfs. Using this method, we studied the masses of hot
subdwarfs from the ESO supernova Ia progenitor survey and Hamburg quasar
survey. The study shows that most of subdwarf B stars have masses between 0.42
and 0.54 $M_\odot$, whilst most sdO stars are in the range 0.40 $\sim$ 0.55
$M_\odot$. Comparing our study to the theoretical mass distributions of Han et
al. (2003), we found that sdO stars with mass less than $\sim$ 0.5 $M_\odot$
may evolve from sdB stars, whilst most high-mass($>$ 0.5 $M_\odot$) sdO stars

Richter and Thomassen argued that, for any given k>=1 and r>=6, there are only

observed that the same argument implies such a conclusion for simple
k-crossing-critical graphs of prescribed average degree r>6. He established
existence of infinite families of simple k-crossing-critical graphs with any
prescribed rational average degree r in [4,6) for infinitely many k and asked
about their existence for r in (3,4). The question was partially settled by
Pinontoan and Richter, who answered it positively for r in (7/2,4).
  The present contribution uses two new constructions of crossing critical
simple graphs along with the one developed by Pinontoan and Richter to unify
these results and to answer Salazar's question by the following statement: for
every rational number r in (3,6) there exists an integer N_r, such that, for
any k>N_r, there exists an infinite family of simple 3-connected
crossing-critical graphs with average degree r and crossing number k. Moreover,
a universal lower bound on k applies for rational numbers in any closed

(BHT) massive gravity theory in three dimensions are considered. In the special
case when the theory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution, apart from
the mass and the angular momentum, the black hole is described by an
independent ""gravitational hair"" parameter, which provides a negative lower
bound for the mass. This bound is saturated at the extremal case and, since the
temperature and the semiclassical entropy vanish, it is naturally regarded as
the ground state. The absence of a global charge associated with the
gravitational hair parameter reflects through the first law of thermodynamics
in the fact that the variation of this parameter can be consistently reabsorbed
by a shift of the global charges, giving further support to consider the
extremal case as the ground state. The rotating black hole fits within relaxed
asymptotic conditions as compared with the ones of Brown and Henneaux, such
that they are invariant under the standard asymptotic symmetries spanned by two
copies of the Virasoro generators, and the algebra of the conserved charges
acquires a central extension. Then it is shown that Strominger's holographic
computation for general relativity can also be extended to the BHT theory;
i.e., assuming that the quantum theory could be consistently described by a
dual conformal field theory at the boundary, the black hole entropy can be
microscopically computed from the asymptotic growth of the number of states
according to Cardy's formula, in exact agreement with the semiclassical result.

processes and morphologies are observed in both X-ray binaries as well as
active galactic nuclei has led to suggestions that the underlying physics could
scale with black hole mass, which could provide a new handle on the problem. In
the last decade, simultaneous broadband campaigns of the fast-varying X-ray
binaries particularly in their microquasar state have driven the development
of, and in some cases altered, our ideas about the inflow/outflow connection in
accreting black holes. Specifically the discovery of correlations between the
radio, infrared and X-ray bands has revealed a remarkable connectivity between
the various emission regions, and argued for a more holistic approach to
tackling questions about accretion. This article reviews the recent major
observational and theoretical advances that focus specifically on the relation
between the two ""sides"" of the accretion process in black holes, with an
emphasis on how new tools can be derived for comparisons across the mass scale.

understanding of the X-ray variability of AGN, of the relationship between AGN
and Galactic black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) and hence of the accretion
process itself, which fuels the emission in AGN and BHBs and is the major
source of power in the universe. In this paper I review our current
understanding of these topics. I begin by considering whether AGN and BHBs show
the same X-ray spectral-timing `states' (e.g. low-flux, hard-spectrum or `hard'
and high-flux, soft-spectrum or `soft'). Observational selection effects mean
that most of the AGN which we have monitored will probably be `soft state'
objects, but AGN are found in the other BHB states, although possibly with
different critical transition accretion rates. I examine timescale scaling
relationships between AGN and BHBs. I show that characteristic power spectral
`bend' timescales, T_B, scale approximately with black hole mass, M_BH, but
inversely with accretion rate, mdot_E, (in units of the Eddington accretion
rate) probably signifying that T_B, arises at the inner edge of the accretion
disc. The relationship T_B proportional to M_BH/mdot_E is a good fit, implying
that no other potential variable, e.g. black hole spin, varies significantly.
Lags between hard and soft X-ray bands as a function of Fourier timescale
follow similar patterns in AGN and BHBs. [Abridged]

introduction to dynamics and electromagnetism in the spacetime near black
holes. We then present a brief summary of the classical Blandford-Znajek
mechanism and its conceptual foundations. Recently, it has become possible to
study these effects in much greater detail using numerical simulation. After
discussing which aspects of the problem can be handled well by numerical means
and which aspects remain beyond the grasp of such methods, we summarize their
results so far. Simulations have confirmed that processes akin to the classical
Blandford-Znajek mechanism can launch powerful electromagnetically-dominated
jets, and have shown how the jet luminosity can be related to black hole spin
and concurrent accretion rate. However, they have also shown that the
luminosity and variability of jets can depend strongly on magnetic field
geometry. We close with a discussion of several important open questions.

consensus of the last decade, we show that the time derivative of the
cosmological scale factor, is a constant. We derive H(z), the Hubble parameter,
as a function of the redshift, z. Based on H(z), we derive a curve of the
Distance Modulus versus log(z). This curve fits data from supernovae
observations, without any free parameters. This fit is as good as that obtained
by current cosmology, which needs the free parameters Omega_M and Omega_Lambda.
We obtain these results by using the hitherto un-noticed fact that the global
gravitational energy density in our Hubble Sphere (HS) is equal to the
Cosmological Microwave Background (CMB) energy density. We derive the dynamic
and kinematic relations that govern the motions of celestial bodies in and
around galaxies. This derivation does not require any gravitating matter beyond
the observed baryonic matter. The theoretical Rotation Curves (RC), resulting
from these relations, fit observed RCs. We obtain these results by examining
the interplay between the local gravitational energy density, around a galaxy,
and the CMB energy density. This interplay causes the inhomogeneous and
anisotropic space expansion around a galaxy.

potential `microquasars', so much as all galactic nuclei may have been quasars,
once upon a time. The necessary ingredients for a compact object of stellar
mass to qualify as a microquasar seem to be: accretion, rotation and magnetic
field. The presence of a black hole may help, but is not strictly required,
since neutron star X-ray binaries and dwarf novae can be powerful jet sources
as well. The above issues are broadly discussed throughout this Chapter, with a
a rather trivial question in mind: why do we care? In other words: are jets a
negligible phenomenon in terms of accretion power, or do they contribute
significantly to dissipating gravitational potential energy? How do they
influence their surroundings? The latter point is especially relevant in a
broader context, as there is mounting evidence that outflows powered by
super-massive black holes in external galaxies may play a crucial role in
regulating the evolution of cosmic structures. Microquasars can also be thought
of as a form of quasars for the impatient: what makes them appealing, despite
their low number statistics with respect to quasars, are the fast variability
time-scales. In the first approximation, the physics of the jet-accretion
coupling in the innermost regions should be set by the mass/size of the
accretor: stellar mass objects vary on 10^5-10^8 times shorter time-scales,
making it possible to study variable accretion modes and related ejection
phenomena over average Ph.D. time-scales. [Abridged]
