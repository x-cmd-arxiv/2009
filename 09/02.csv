can be viewed as a strongly fluctuating liquid of valence bonds, while in
disordered chains these bonds lock into random singlet states on long length
scales. We show that this phenomenon can be studied numerically, even in the
case of weak disorder, by calculating the mean value of the number of valence
bonds leaving a block of $L$ contiguous spins (the valence-bond entanglement
entropy) as well as the fluctuations in this number. These fluctuations show a
clear crossover from a small $L$ regime, in which they behave similar to those
of the uniform model, to a large $L$ regime in which they saturate in a way
consistent with the formation of a random singlet state on long length scales.
A scaling analysis of these fluctuations is used to study the dependence on
disorder strength of the length scale characterizing the crossover between
these two regimes. Results are obtained for a class of models which include, in
addition to the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain, the uniform and disordered critical
1D transverse-field Ising model and chains of interacting non-Abelian anyons.

could be plasma heated by the shock formed by the accretion process. However
its nature is still being debated. Our aim is to probe the soft X-ray emission
from the high-density plasma component in classical T Tauri stars to check
whether this is plasma heated in the accretion shock or whether it is coronal
plasma. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy allows us to measure individual line
fluxes. We analyze X-ray spectra of the classical T Tauri stars MP Muscae and
TW Hydrae. Our aim is to evaluate line ratios to search for optical depth
effects, which are expected in the accretion-driven scenario. We also derive
the plasma emission measure distributions EMD, to investigate whether and how
the EMD of accreting and non accreting young stars differ. The results are
compared to those obtained for the non-accreting weak-line T Tauri star TWA 5.
We find evidence of resonance scattering in the strongest lines of MP Mus,
supporting the idea that soft X-rays are produced by plasma heated in the
accretion shock. We also find that the EMD of MP Mus has two peaks: a cool peak
at temperatures expected for plasma heated in the accretion shock, and a hot
peak typical of coronal plasma. The shape of the EMD of MP Mus appears to be
the superposition of the EMD of a pure coronal source, like TWA 5, and an EMD
alike that of TW Hydrae, which is instead dominated by shock-heated plasma.

  In the first case subcritical regions increase, but there is no estimate on
the expansion rate. In the second case they expand with a positive rate and
always spread over the whole domain after a finite time, depending only on the

we had to self-consistently inflate the bubbles with jets, rather than inject
them artificially. Our main results are as follows
  (1) Feedback mechanisms that are based on Bondi accretion fail. Instead, the
accretion to the central super-massive black hole (SMBH) is in the form of cold
dense blobs that fall-in from an extended region. (2) Slow massive wide (SMW)
jets, or rapidly precessing jets, can inflate bubbles similar to those observed
in CF clusters. (3) Contrary to some claims in the literature, the inflated
bubbles are stable for a relatively long time, becoming unstable only at later
times. (4) A single bubble inflation episode excites multiple sound waves and
shocks. These can then heat the intracluster medium (ICM). (5) Mixing of the
bubble material to the ICM is efficient, and can serve as a main heating
channel. (6) The heating processes work in all directions, and can explain the
heating of the ICM in CF in clusters and in galaxies.

detectors were flown in satellites, following a decade of theoretical

pi-zero decay mechanism. The seventies were a golden era for gamma-ray and
cosmic-ray astrophysics, with the (re)discovery of the ""diffuse shock
acceleration"" theory for cosmic rays, and the first CO and GeV gamma-ray
surveys of the galactic plane, verifying the importance of pi-zero decay in the
large-scale gamma-ray emission of the Galaxy. But because of this strong
galactic background, GeV gamma-ray sources were hard to identify. The first
such sources definitely identified were three pulsars, with a suggestion that
supernova remnants interacting with molecular clouds in massive star-forming
regions (""SNOBs"") were also gamma-ray sources. Because of their improved
sensitivity and spatial resolution, ground-based Cerenkov telescopes, detecting
gamma-rays at > TeV energies, are now able to resolve molecular cloud-sized
objects at a few kpc. SNOB-like objects like IC443 and W28 are detected at GeV
and TeV energies, and show spatial evidence for cosmic-ray interactions between
an SNR shock wave and nearby molecular clouds, and subsequent pi-zero decay.
However, the spectral evidence does not clearly support this mechanism. We
propose to use another tool for probing the interaction of the low-energy
component of the putative local cosmic rays, in the form of enhanced ionization
in TeV-bright molecular clouds, using millimeter observations.

of both twistor and dual twistor variables. We show that it can be related to
other representations of amplitudes by applying the global residue theorem to
deform the contour of integration. For six and seven particles we demonstrate
explicitly that certain contour deformations rewrite the connected prescription
as the BCFW representation, thereby establishing a concrete link between
Witten's twistor string theory and the dual formulation for the S-matrix of N=4
SYM recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed et. al. Other choices of integration
contour also give rise to ""intermediate prescriptions"". We expect a similar
though more intricate structure for more general amplitudes.

organize around megaparsec-scale filament axes as well as near the cluster

star formation in these galaxies are most likely due to merger interactions in

between, the two HS in a spherical pore, two sticked HS in a spherical pore,
and two HS on a spherical surface partition functions are traced. These
relations make meaningful the limiting caging and low density behavior. Turning
to the system of two HS in a spherical pore, we also analytically evaluate the
pressure tensor. The thermodynamic properties of the system are discussed. To
accomplish this statement we purposely focus in the overall characteristics of
the inhomogeneous fluid system, instead of concentrate in the peculiarities of
a few body system. Hence, we analyse the equation of state, the pressure at the
wall, and the fluid-substrate surface tension. The consequences of new results
about the spherically confined system of two HS in D dimension on the confined

opposed to the usual twistors that make the ordinary superconformal properties
manifest. The relation between momentum twistors and on-shell momenta is
algebraic, so the translation procedure does not rely on any choice of
space-time signature. We show that tree amplitudes and box coefficients are
succinctly generated by integration of holomorphic delta-functions in momentum

numerous applications can be found for this novel fracture problem. In the
limit of strong disorder, our results show that all the cracks are located on a
single self-similar connected line of fractal dimension $D_{b} \approx 1.22$.
For weak disorder, the number of cracks spreads all over the entire network
before global connectivity is lost. Strikingly, the disconnecting path
(backbone) is, however, completely independent on the disorder.

This is consistent with unstratified simulations of the streaming instability

magnetic field lines fundamentally changes the stability of the ICM, leading to
the ""heat-flux buoyancy instability"" when $dT/dr>0$ and the ""magnetothermal
instability"" when $dT/dr<0$. The ICM is thus buoyantly unstable regardless of
the signs of $dT/dr$ and $ds/dr$. On the other hand, these
temperature-gradient-driven instabilities saturate by reorienting the magnetic
field (perpendicular to $\hat{\bf r}$ when $dT/dr>0$ and parallel to $\hat{\bf
r}$ when $dT/dr<0$), without generating sustained convection. We show that
after an anisotropically conducting plasma reaches this nonlinearly stable
magnetic configuration, it experiences a buoyant restoring force that resists
further distortions of the magnetic field. This restoring force is analogous to
the buoyant restoring force experienced by a stably stratified adiabatic
plasma. We argue that in order for a driving mechanism (e.g, galaxy motions or
cosmic-ray buoyancy) to overcome this restoring force and generate turbulence
in the ICM, the strength of the driving must exceed a threshold, corresponding
to turbulent velocities $\gtrsim 10 -100 {km/s}$. For weaker driving, the ICM
remains in its nonlinearly stable magnetic configuration, and turbulent mixing
is effectively absent. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
turbulent diffusion of metals and heat in the ICM.

be stars in binary systems, but little observational evidence exists to confirm
the hypothesis. We suggest that the collision of the supernova ejecta with its
companion star should produce detectable emission in the hours and days
following the explosion. The interaction occurs at distances ~10^11-10^13 cm
and shocks the impacting supernova debris, dissipating kinetic energy and
re-heating the gas. Initially, some radiation may escape promptly through the
evacuated region of the shadowcone, producing a bright X-ray (0.1-2 keV) burst
lasting minutes to hours with luminosity L ~ 10^44 ergs/s. Continuing radiative
diffusion from deeper layers of shock heated ejecta produces a longer lasting
optical/UV emission which exceeds the radioactively powered luminosity of the
supernova for the first few days after the explosion. These signatures are
prominent for viewing angles looking down upon the shocked region, or about 10%
of the time. The properties of the emission provide a straightforward measure
of the separation distance between the stars and hence (assuming Roche lobe
overflow) the companion's radius. Current optical and UV data sets likely
already constrain red giant companions. By systematically acquiring early time
data for many supernovae, it should eventually be possible to empirically
determine how the parameters of the progenitor system influence the outcome of
the explosion.

strongly affect galaxy formation and evolution. Galaxy evolution simulations
typically incorporate an ultraviolet background which falls off rapidly above
z=3; e.g., that of Haardt & Madau (1996). However, this decline may be too
steep to fit the WMAP constraints on electron scattering optical depth or
observations of intermediate redshift (z ~ 2-4) Ly-alpha forest transmission.
As an alternative, we present simulations of the cosmological formation of
individual galaxies with UV backgrounds that decline more slowly at high
redshift: both a simple intensity rescaling and the background recently derived
by Faucher-Giguere (2009), which softens the spectrum at higher redshifts. We
also test an approximation of the X-ray background with a similar z-dependence.
We find for the test galaxies that an increase in either the intensity or
hardness of ionizing radiation generically pushes star formation towards lower
redshifts: although overall star formation in the simulation boxes is reduced
by 10-25%, the galaxies show a factor of ~2 increase in the fraction of stars
within a 30 kpc radius that are formed after z=1. Other effects include late
gas inflows enhanced up to 30 times, stellar half-mass radii decreased by up to
30%, central velocity dispersions increased up to 40%, and a strong reduction
in substructure. The magnitude of the effects depends on the
environmental/accretion properties of the particular galaxy.

sheet and microtubule structures using thermodynamic analysis and stochastic
simulations. With the novel assumptions that tubulins can laterally interact in
two different forms, and allosterically affect neighboring lateral

temperature, the allosteric effect results in the observed sheet structure with
alternating lateral interactions as the thermodynamically most stable form. At
normal microtubule assembly temperature, our work indicates that a class of

around the stars in tight binary systems (separations ~ 20 AU. In such systems,
the initial stages of runaway embryo formation are expected to only take place
within some critical disk radius a_{crit}, due to the perturbing effect of the
binary companions (Thebault et al. 2009). We perform n-body simulations of the
evolution of such a population of inner-disk embryos surrounded by an
outer-disk of smaller planetesimals. Taking Alpha Centauri-B as our fiducial
reference example in which a_{crit} ~ 0.7 AU, and using a Minimum Mass Nebular
Model with $\Sigma \propto a^{-3/2}$, we find that within 10^6 yrs (10^7 yrs),
systems will on average contain embryos which have migrated out to 0.9 AU (1.2
AU), with the average outer-most body having a mass of 0.2 M_{earth} 0.4
M_{earth}. Changes to increase the surface density of solids or to use a
flatter profile both produce increased embryo migration and growth. At a given
time, the relative change in semi-major axis of the outer-most embryo in these
simulations is found to be essentially independent of a_{crit}, and we note
that little further embryo migration takes place beyond 10^7 years. We conclude
that the suppression of runaway growth outside a_{crit} does not mean that the
habitable zones in such tight binary systems will be devoid of detectable,
terrestrial mass planets, even if a_{crit} lies significantly interior to the
inner edge of the habitable zone.

information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. A precise
knowledge of the host stars is necessary to derive the planetary properties
accurately. The properties of the host stars, especially their chemical
composition, are also of interest in their own right. Information about planet
formation is inferred by, among others, correlations between different
parameters such as the orbital period and the metallicity of the host stars.
The stellar properties studied should be derived as homogeneously as possible.
The present work provides new, uniformly derived parameters for 13 host stars
of transiting planets. Effective temperature, surface gravity, microturbulence
parameter, and iron abundance were derived from spectra of both high
signal-to-noise ratio and high resolution by assuming iron excitation and
ionization equilibria. For some stars, the new parameters differ from previous
determinations, which is indicative of changes in the planetary radii. A
systematic offset in the abundance scale with respect to previous assessments
is found for the TrES and HAT objects. Our abundance measurements are
remarkably robust in terms of the uncertainties in surface gravities. The iron
abundances measured in the present work are supplemented by all previous
determinations using the same analysis technique. The distribution of iron
abundance then agrees well with the known metal-rich distribution of planet
host stars. To facilitate future studies, the spectroscopic results of the
current work are supplemented by the findings for other host stars of
transiting planets, for a total dataset of 50 objects.

as wavelet based density estimation (WBDE), was previously introduced in the
statistical literature to estimate probability densities given a finite number
of independent measurements. Its novel application to plasma simulations can be
viewed as a natural extension of the finite size particles (FSP) approach, with
the advantage of estimating more accurately distribution functions that have
localized sharp features. The proposed method preserves the moments of the
particle distribution function to a good level of accuracy, has no constraints
on the dimensionality of the system, does not require an a priori selection of
a global smoothing scale, and its able to adapt locally to the smoothness of
the density based on the given discrete particle data. Most importantly, the
computational cost of the denoising stage is of the same order as one time step
of a FSP simulation. The method is compared with a recently proposed proper
orthogonal decomposition based method, and it is tested with three particle
data sets that involve different levels of collisionality and interaction with
external and self-consistent fields.

straw-man ultra-compact object with no event horizon, but which is otherwise
almost identical to a black hole, we consider a nonrotating thin-shell model
inspired by Mazur and Mottola's gravastar, which has a Schwarzschild exterior,
a de Sitter interior and an infinitely thin shell with finite tension
separating the two regions. As viewed from the external space-time, the shell
can be located arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild radius, so a gravastar
might seem indistinguishable from a black hole when tests are only performed on
its external metric. We study the linearized dynamics of the system, and in
particular the junction conditions connecting internal and external
gravitational perturbations. As a first application of the formalism we compute
polar and axial oscillation modes of a thin-shell gravastar. We show that the
quasinormal mode spectrum is completely different from that of a black hole,
even in the limit when the surface redshift becomes infinite. Polar QNMs depend
on the equation of state of matter on the shell and can be used to distinguish
between different gravastar models. Our calculations suggest that
low-compactness gravastars could be unstable when the sound speed on the shell

only primary production of light hadrons is considered. There is evidence that
the primary cross section for each particle may have the same value for pp and
pbar-p collisions and that it may have nearly constant values between
sqrt(s)=63 GeV and sqrt(s)=1800 GeV. Fits to the final state transverse momenta
of the particles using a gas model favor a temperature T=132 MeV, a chemical
potential mu=129 MeV, and a transverse flow of the gas with beta_f=0.27.

emission mechanism for high-power jets at kpc scales is hotly debated. Two
mechanisms have been proposed: either inverse-Compton of cosmic microwave

slowly leaking out. The real part of the complex quasinormal resonances is
related to the angular velocity at the unstable null geodesic. The imaginary
part of the resonances is related to the instability timescale (or the inverse
Lyapunov exponent) of the orbit. While this geometric-optics description of the
black-hole quasinormal resonances in terms of perturbed null {\it rays} is very
appealing and intuitive, it is still highly important to verify the validity of
this approach by directly analyzing the Teukolsky wave equation which governs
the dynamics of perturbation {\it waves} in the black-hole spacetime. This is
the main goal of the present paper. We first use the geometric-optics technique
of perturbing a bundle of unstable null rays to calculate the resonances of
near-extremal Kerr black holes in the eikonal approximation. We then directly
solve the Teukolsky wave equation (supplemented by the appropriate physical
boundary conditions) and show that the resultant quasinormal spectrum obtained
directly from the wave analysis is in accord with the spectrum obtained from
the geometric-optics approximation of perturbed null rays.

an appropriate asymptotic behavior of the solution for a large momentum cutoff.

by imposing the Ward-Takahashi identity, and another by imposing the
generalized Ward-Takahashi identity via sources that generate symmetry
transformations. We apply the two formalisms to concrete models such as QED, YM

nonparametric regression with unbounded loss functions. The results imply that
all the Gaussian nonparametric regression procedures can be robustified in a
unified way. A key step in our equivalence argument is to bin the data and then
take the median of each bin. The asymptotic equivalence results have
significant practical implications. To illustrate the general principles of the
equivalence argument we consider two important nonparametric inference
problems: robust estimation of the regression function and the estimation of a
quadratic functional. In both cases easily implementable procedures are
constructed and are shown to enjoy simultaneously a high degree of robustness
and adaptivity. Other problems such as construction of confidence sets and
nonparametric hypothesis testing can be handled in a similar fashion.

We then study a class of games that generalizes congestion games with

bottleneck congestion games in networks, we identify cases in which the
potential function associated with the LIP leads to polynomial time algorithms
computing a strong Nash equilibrium. Finally, we investigate the LIP for
infinite games. We show that the LIP does not imply the existence of a

however, we prove existence of SNE. As a consequence, we prove that bottleneck
congestion games with infinite strategy spaces and continuous cost functions

new 3.0 sigma anomaly at lower energies, down to 200 MeV. The nu_e data have so
far an insufficient statistics to be conclusive with LSND's anti-nu_e. The
present proposal at the CERN-PS is based on two strictly identical LAr-TPC
detectors in the near and far positions, respectively at 127 and 850 m from the

electron-neutrino signal. This project will benefit from the already developed
technology of ICARUS T600, well tested on surface in Pavia, without the need of
any major R&D activity and without the added problems of an underground
experiment (CNGS-2). The superior quality of the Liquid Argon imaging TPC and
its unique electron - pi-zero discrimination allow full rejection of the NC
background, without efficiency loss for electron neutrino detection. In two
years of exposure, the far detector mass of 600 tons and a reasonable
utilization of the CERN-PS with the refurbished previous TT7 beam line will
allow to collect about 10^6 charged current events, largely adequate to settle

and prove that any SDSE (S) such that H_S is Hopf is the concatenation of
several fundamental or cyclic systems after the application of a change of

certain oriented graph. 2. g_S is an iterated extension of the Fa\`a di Bruno

MRI applications, parallel MRI (pMRI) acquisition techniques with multiple
coils acquisition have emerged since the early 1990s as powerful 3D imaging
methods that allow faster acquisition of reduced Field of View (FOV) images. In
these techniques, the full FOV image has to be reconstructed from the resulting
acquired undersampled k-space data. To this end, several reconstruction
techniques have been proposed such as the widely-used SENSE method. However,
the reconstructed image generally presents artifacts when perturbations occur
in both the measured data and the estimated coil sensitivity maps. In this
paper, we aim at achieving good reconstructed image quality when using low
magnetic field and high reduction factor. Under these severe experimental
conditions, neither the SENSE method nor the Tikhonov regularization in the
image domain give convincing results. To this aim, we present a novel method
for SENSE-based reconstruction which proceeds with regularization in the
complex wavelet domain. To further enhance the reconstructed image quality,
local convex constraints are added in the regularization process. In vivo
experiments carried out on Gradient-Echo (GRE) anatomical and Echo-Planar
Imaging (EPI) functional MRI data at 1.5 Tesla indicate that the proposed
algorithm provides reconstructed images with reduced artifacts for high
reduction factor.

twofold: i) to avoid numerical singularities in the integral representation of
the potential (i.e., arising when the relative separation vanishes), and ii) to
acount for stratification of matter in the direction perpendicular to the disc
mid-plane. So far, most studies have considered LAMBDA as a free parameter and
various values or formulae have been proposed without much mathematical
justification. In this paper, we demonstrate by means of a rigorous calculus
that it is possible to define LAMBDA such that the gravitational potential of a
flat disc coincides at order zero with that of a geometically thin disc of the
same surface density. Our prescription for LAMBDA, valid in the local,
axisymmetric limit, has the required properties i) and ii). It is mainly an
analytical function of the radius and disc thickness, and is sensitive to the
vertical stratification. For mass density profiles considered (namely, profiles
expandable over even powers of the altitude), we find that LAMBDA : i) is
independant of the numerical mesh, ii) is always a fraction of the local
thickness H, iii) goes through a minimum at the singularity (i.e., at null
separation), and iv) is such that 0.13 < LAMBDA/H < 0.29 typically (depending
on the separation and on density profile). These results should help us to
improve the quality of 2D- and 3D-simulations of gaseous discs in several
respects (physical realism, accuracy, and computing time).

state of the accretion disk on a highly magnetised neutron star. The model we
describe has a local character and represents the extension of the crystalline
structure outlined in Coppi (2005), dealing with a local model too, when a
specific accretion rate is taken into account. We limit our attention to the
linearised MHD formulation of the electromagnetic back-reaction characterising
the equilibrium, by fixing the structure of the radial, vertical and azimuthal
profiles. Since we deal with toroidal currents only, the consistency of the
model is ensured by the presence of a small collisional effect,
phenomenologically described by a non-zero constant Nernst coefficient (thermal
power of the plasma). Such an effect provides a proper balance of the electron
force equation via non zero temperature gradients, related directly to the
radial and vertical velocity components.
  We show that the obtained profile has the typical oscillating feature of the
crystalline structure, reconciled with the presence of viscosity, associated to
the differential rotation of the disk, and with a net accretion rate. In fact,
we provide a direct relation between the electromagnetic reaction of the disk
and the (no longer zero) increasing of its mass per unit time. The radial
accretion component of the velocity results to be few orders of magnitude below
the equatorial sound velocity. Its oscillating-like character does not allow a
real matter in-fall to the central object (an effect to be searched into
non-linear MHD corrections), but it accounts for the out-coming of steady
fluxes, favourable to the ring-like morphology of the disk.

The major findings of our analysis are: 1) GMCs are associated with an envelope
of HI emission, 2) in GMCs [average CO intensity] is proportional to [average
HI intensity]^[1.1+-0.1] and 3) the HI intensity tends to increase with the
star formation activity within GMCs, from Type I to Type III. An analysis of
the HI envelopes associated with GMCs shows that their average linewidth is 14
km s-1 and the mean density in the envelope is 10 cm-3. We argue that the HI
envelopes are gravitationally bound by GMCs. These findings are consistent with
a continual increase in the mass of GMCs via HI accretion at an accretion rate
of 0.05 Msun/yr over a time scale of 10 Myr. The growth of GMCs is terminated
via dissipative ionization and/or stellar-wind disruption in the final stage of

II and Sagittarius around the Milky Way, and supports the trend that M31
satellites are larger than their Milky Way counterparts. Andromeda XXII is much
fainter (M_V=-6.5+/-0.8) and lies a lot closer in projection to M33 than it
does to M31 (42 vs. 224 kpc), suggesting that it could be the first Triangulum
satellite to be discovered. Although this is a very exciting possibility in the
context of a past interaction of M33 with M31 and the fate of its satellite
system, a confirmation will have to await a good distance estimate to confirm
its physical proximity to M33. Along with the dwarf galaxies found in previous
surveys of the M31 surroundings, these two new satellites bring the number of
dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 20.

identification of individuals carrying disease variants. Rapid sequencing by
new technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it
is still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve
cost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which
enable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals.
However, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals
in a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases.
  We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach,
which is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental
procedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of
rare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially
in situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual.
  Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance
performance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing
costs. For example, when targeting a small enough genomic region (~100
base-pairs) and using only ~10 sequencing lanes and ~10 distinct barcodes, one
can recover the identity of 4 rare allele carriers out of a population of over
4000 individuals.

that scenarios involving the slow migration of Neptune over a large distance

to the properties of the known Trojans. Scenarios with faster migration (5Myr),
and those in which Neptune migrates from 23.1AU to its current location, fail
to adequately reproduce the current day Trojan population. Scenarios which
avoid disruptive perturbation events between Uranus and Neptune fail to yield
any significant excitation of pre-formed Trojans (transported with efficiencies
between 30 and 98% whilst maintaining the dynamically cold nature of these
objects). Conversely, scenarios with periods of strong Uranus-Neptune
perturbation lead to the almost complete loss of such pre-formed objects. In
these cases, a small fraction (~0.15%) of these escaped objects are later
recaptured as Trojans prior to the end of migration, with a wide range of
eccentricities (<0.35) and inclinations (<40 deg). In all scenarios (including
those with such disruptive interaction between Uranus and Neptune) the capture
of objects from the trans-Neptunian disk (through which Neptune migrates) is
achieved with efficiencies between ~0.1 and ~1%. The captured Trojans display a
wide range of inclinations (<40 deg for slow migration, and <20 deg for rapid

minimization has been shown to be effective for this task both theoretically
and empirically. With the virtues of both regularization and sparsity, the
$L_1$-penalized squared error minimization method Lasso has been popular in
regression models and beyond. In this paper, we combine different norms
including $L_1$ to form an intelligent penalty in order to add side information
to the fitting of a regression or classification model to obtain reasonable
estimates. Specifically, we introduce the Composite Absolute Penalties (CAP)
family, which allows given grouping and hierarchical relationships between the
predictors to be expressed. CAP penalties are built by defining groups and
combining the properties of norm penalties at the across-group and within-group
levels. Grouped selection occurs for nonoverlapping groups. Hierarchical
variable selection is reached by defining groups with particular overlapping
patterns. We propose using the BLASSO and cross-validation to compute CAP
estimates in general. For a subfamily of CAP estimates involving only the $L_1$
and $L_{\infty}$ norms, we introduce the iCAP algorithm to trace the entire
regularization path for the grouped selection problem. Within this subfamily,
unbiased estimates of the degrees of freedom (df) are derived so that the
regularization parameter is selected without cross-validation. CAP is shown to
improve on the predictive performance of the LASSO in a series of simulated
experiments, including cases with $p\gg n$ and possibly mis-specified
groupings. When the complexity of a model is properly calculated, iCAP is seen
to be parsimonious in the experiments.

investigation of ultracold quantum gases. Flow equations are derived for a Bose
gas with approximately pointlike interaction, for a Fermi gas with two

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover and for a Fermi gas with three
components. The solution of the flow equations determine the properties of
these systems both in the few-body regime and in thermal equilibrium.
  For the Bose gas this covers the quantum phase diagram, the condensate and
superfluid fraction, the critical temperature, the correlation length, the
specific heat or sound propagation. The properties are discussed both for three
and two spatial dimensions. The discussion of the Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC
crossover concentrates on the effect of particle-hole fluctuations but
addresses the complete phase diagram. For the three component fermions, the
flow equations in the few-body regime show a limit-cycle scaling and the Efimov
tower of three-body bound states. Applied to the case of Lithium they explain
recently observed three-body loss features. Extending the calculations by
continuity to nonzero density, it is found that a new trion phase separates a
BCS and a BEC phase for three component fermions close to a common resonance.
  More formal is the derivation of a new exact flow equation for scale
dependent composite operators. This equation allows for example a better

  The third decade of September 2009 was accompanied with a stock market
correction typically within the range of 4-5% worldwide. Taking into account
the market patterns that followed the time of delivering the previous scenario
we present an updated scenario whose critical time corresponds to October 28,
2009.
  Assuming quite evident (as of November 12, 2009) termination of the
correction due to the above critical time we extend - consistently with our
methodology - the stock market forecasting scenario. The corresponding expected
SP500 future trend is shown in Fig. 5 and it supports a potential average
continuation of increases to as far into the future as the turn of
February/March 2010. We also indicate the log-periodic patterns on the gold
market and they point to the end of November 2009 as the time when the trend
reversal - likely local however - is expected to begin.

graphs. Our focus is on graphs constructed from the join and related graph
operators. Some specific results we prove include: (1) The join of a weighted
two-vertex graph with any regular graph has perfect state transfer. This
generalizes a result of Casaccino et al. [clms09] where the regular graph is a
complete graph or a complete graph with a missing link. In contrast, the
half-join of a weighted two-vertex graph with any weighted regular graph has no
perfect state transfer. This implies that adding weights in a complete
bipartite graph do not help in achieving perfect state transfer. (2) A Hamming
graph has perfect state transfer between each pair of its vertices. This is
obtained using a closure property on weighted Cartesian products of perfect
state transfer graphs. Moreover, on the hypercube, we show that perfect state
transfer occurs between uniform superpositions on pairs of arbitrary subcubes.
This generalizes results of Bernasconi et al. [bgs08] and Moore and Russell
[mr02]. Our techniques rely heavily on the spectral properties of graphs built
using the join and Cartesian product operators.

limiting distributions of these test statistics under null hypotheses are
always normal distributions, and they can be implemented easily for practical
use. If null hypotheses are false, as the sample size goes to infinity, they
diverge to infinity and consequently are consistent tests for any alternative.
The approach can be applied to various null hypotheses such as the independence
between the component series, the equality of the autocovariance functions or
the autocorrelation functions of the component series, the separability of the
covariance matrix function and the time reversibility. Furthermore, a null
hypothesis with a nonlinear constraint like the conditional independence

formal matrix calculus is introduced and developed for pairs of matrices over

with coefficients in R. In the case when the ring R is a field, every pair is
equivalent to a homogeneous system.
  Using the formal matrix calculus, two alternate presentations are given for
the Grothendieck group $K_0 (R-mod, \oplus)$ of the category R-mod of finitely
presented modules. One of these presentations suggests a homological
interpretation, and so a complex is introduced whose 0-dimensional homology is
naturally isomorphic to $K_0 (R-mod, \oplus).$ A computation shows that if R =
k is a field, then the 1-dimensional homology group is given by the
abelianization of the multiplicative group of k, modulo the subgroup {1, -1}.
  The formal matrix calculus, which consists of three rules of matrix
operation, is the syntax of a deductive system whose completeness was proved by
Prest. The three rules of inference of this deductive system correspond to the
three rules of matrix operation, which appear in the formal matrix calculus as
the Rules of Divisibility.

the waist of an extended bipolar structure. By deprojection, the inclination of
