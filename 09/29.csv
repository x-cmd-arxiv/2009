tested that preserves the complete supersymmetry on the lattice. The results of
a one-dimensional nonperturbative simulation show the realization of the full
supersymmetry and the correct continuum limit of the theory. It is proven that
the violation of supersymmetry due to the absence of the Leibniz rule on the
lattice can be amended only with a nonlocal derivative and nonlocal interaction
term. The fermion doubling problem is also discussed, which leads to another
important source of supersymmetry breaking on the lattice. This problem is also
solved with a nonlocal realization.

single-antenna receivers is considered, where the channel of receiver $r$ takes
one of the $J_r$ finite values. It is assumed that the channel states of each
receiver are randomly selected from $\mathds{R}^{M\times 1}$ (or from
$\mathds{C}^{M\times 1}$). It is shown that no matter what $J_r$ is, the
degrees of freedom (DoF) of $\frac{MK}{M+K-1}$ is achievable. The achievable
scheme relies on the idea of interference alignment at receivers, without
exploiting the possibility of cooperation among transmit antennas. It is proven
that if $J_r \geq M$, $r=1,...,K$, this scheme achieves the optimal DoF. This
results implies that when the uncertainty of the base station about the channel
realization is considerable, the system loses the gain of cooperation. However,
it still benefits from the gain of interference alignment. In fact, in this
case, the compound broadcast channel is treated as a compound X channel.
  Moreover, it is shown that when the base station knows the channel states of
some of the receivers, a combination of transmit cooperation and interference
alignment would achieve the optimal DoF.
  Like time-invariant $K$-user interference channels, the naive vector-space
approaches of interference management seem insufficient to achieve the optimal
DoF of this channel. In this paper, we use the Number-Theory approach of
alignment, recently developed by Motahari et al.[1]. We extend the approach of
[1] to complex channels as well, therefore all the results that we present are
valid for both real and complex channels.

than quantum mechanics, with particular reference to the notion of information
causality recently proposed by Pawlowski et. al. (arXiv:0905.2992). We consider
two entropic quantities, which we term measurement and mixing entropy. In
classical and quantum theory, they are equal, being given by the Shannon and
von Neumann entropies respectively; in general, however, they are very
different. In particular, while measurement entropy is easily seen to be
concave, mixing entropy need not be. In fact, as we show, mixing entropy is not
concave whenever the state space is a non-simplicial polytope. Thus, the
condition that measurement and mixing entropies coincide is a strong constraint
on possible theories. We call theories with this property monoentropic.
Measurement entropy is subadditive, but not in general strongly subadditive.
Equivalently, if we define the mutual information between two systems A and B
by the usual formula I(A:B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(AB) where H denotes the
measurement entropy and AB is a non-signaling composite of A and B, then it can
happen that I(A:BC) < I(A:B). This is relevant to information causality in the
sense of Pawlowski et al.: we show that any monoentropic non-signaling theory
in which measurement entropy is strongly subadditive, and also satisfies a
version of the Holevo bound, is informationally causal, and on the other hand
we observe that Popescu-Rohrlich boxes, which violate information causality,
also violate strong subadditivity. We also explore the interplay between
measurement and mixing entropy and various natural conditions on theories that
arise in quantum axiomatics.

volume dependence of the chiral condensate and chiral susceptibilities in QCD

mass (m_s) is chosen close to its physical value; the two degenerate light
quark masses (m_l) are varied in a wide range 1/80 \le m_l/m_s \le 2/5, where
the smallest light quark mass value corresponds to a pseudo-scalar Goldstone
mass of about 75 MeV. All calculations are performed with staggered fermions on
lattices with temporal extent Nt=4. We show that numerical results are
consistent with O(N) scaling in the chiral limit. We find that in the region of
physical light quark mass values, m_l/m_s \simeq 1/20, the temperature and
quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate is already dominated by
universal properties of QCD that are encoded in the scaling function for the
chiral order parameter, the magnetic equation of state. We also provide
evidence for the influence of thermal fluctuations of Goldstone modes on the
chiral condensate at finite temperature. At temperatures below, but close to
the chiral phase transition at vanishing quark mass, this leads to a
characteristic dependence of the light quark chiral condensate on the square
root of the light quark mass.

Sr, or Ca) is $A$-terminated with a $(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ or
$(1\times 2)$ order. The $(1\times 2)$ ordered structure yields a $(1\times 2)$
dimerized STM image, in agreement with the experimental observation. The $A$
atoms are found to diffuse on the surface with a small energy barrier so that
the cleaving process may destroy the $A$ atoms ordering. At the very low
temperatures this may result in an As-terminated surface with the $A$ atoms in
randomly assembling. The As-terminated BaFe$_2$As$_2$ surface in orthorhombic
phase is $(\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ buckled, giving rise to a
switchable $(\sqrt{2}\times \sqrt{2})R45^{\circ}$ STM pattern upon varying the
applied bias. No any reconstruction is found for the other As-terminated
surfaces. There are surface states crossing or nearby the Fermi energy in the
As-terminated and $(1\times 2)$ $A$-terminated surfaces. A unified physical
picture is thus established to help understand the cleaved $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$(001)
surfaces.

but the hardest to model as well. There are numerous methods of computing such
fields by extrapolating vector magnetograms from the photosphere, but very few
attempts have so far made quantitative use of coronal morphology. We present a
method to make such quantitative use of X-Ray and EUV images of coronal loops.
Each individual loop is fit to a field line of a linear force-free field,
allowing the estimation of the field line's twist, three-dimensional geometry
and the field strength along it.
  We assess the validity of such a reconstruction since the actual corona is
probably not a linear force-free field and that the superposition of linear
force-free fields is generally not itself a force-free field. To do so, we
perform a series of tests on non-linear force-free fields, described in Low &
Lou (1990). For model loops we project field lines onto the photosphere. We
compare several results of the method with the original field, in particular
the three-dimensional loop shapes, local twist (coronal alpha), distribution of
twist in the model photosphere and strength of the magnetic field. We find
that, (i) for these trial fields, the method reconstructs twist with mean
absolute deviation of at most 15% of the range of photospheric twist, (ii) that
heights of the loops are reconstructed with mean absolute deviation of at most
5% of the range of trial heights and (iii) that the magnitude of non-potential
contribution to photospheric field is reconstructed with mean absolute
deviation of at most 10% of the maximal value.

corresponding to a gas mass-loss rate of 8.6(+5.6/-3.4) x 10^-6 solar masses

dust-less mass loss that is certainly occurring within the cluster. The two
most extreme stars, variables V2 and V16, contribute up to 45% of the total
cluster dust-traced mass loss. The SEDs of the more moderate stars indicate the
presence of silicate dust, as expected for low-mass, low-metallicity stars.
Surprisingly, the SED shapes of the stars with the strongest mass-loss rates
appear to require the presence of amorphous carbon dust, possibly in
combination with silicate dust, despite their oxygen-rich nature. These results
corroborate our previous findings in omega Centauri.

Unnikrishnan has suggested that a dynamical interaction leading to the SSC

the scattering of two identical particles, he considers [arXiv: gr-qc/0406043]
the interaction of their spins with the gravito-magnetic field generated by
their scattering motion through cosmic matter-energy. There the direct and
particles-exchanged scattering amplitudes accumulate different quantum phases
which provide the relevant bosonic/fermionic sign between them without applying
the ad hoc SSC rule. Here it is shown that the scattering probabilities given
by the standard implementation of SSC in quantum mechanics are actually not
obtained from the above interaction for most initial spin states of the
scattering particles. Instead, an unrealized peculiar dynamical interaction is
required. Further, a spin-gravito-magnetic interaction as above (with caveats)
would result in a large unmeasured spin-orbit coupling type effect on atomic
energy levels. A comparison with a typical rotation based proof is also
provided.

surprise because of the high values observed. Non-standard models of Big Bang
nucleosynthesis and pre-Galactic cosmic ray fusion and spallation have been
proposed to explain these values. However, the observations of this light
isotope are challenging which may make some detections disputable. The goal was
to determine 6Li/7Li for a sample of metal-poor stars; three of them have been
previously studied and the remaining two are new for this type of study. The
purpose was to increase, if possible, the number of lithium-6 detections and to
confirm previously published results. Spectra of the resonance doublet line of
neutral lithium Li I 670.78nm were taken with the High Dispersion Spectrograph
at the Subaru 8.2m-telescope for a sample of five metal-poor stars (-3.12 <
[Fe/H] < -2.19). The contribution of lithium-6 to the total observed line
profile was estimated from the 1D-LTE analysis of the line asymmetry. Observed
asymmetries could be reproduced assuming isotopic abundance ratios 6Li/7Li of
the order of: 0.004 for BD+26 3578, ~ 0.010 for BD+02 3375 and G 64-37, 0.025
for BD+20 3603 and 0.047 for BD-04 3208. We found that these results were very
sensitive to several of the assumptions made in the analysis, in particular,
the treatment of the residual structure in the analysed spectra. Our final
estimates for the errors are respectively delta_6Li/7Li=+- 0.028, 0.029, 0.039,
0.025 and 0.039. The 6Li/7Li ratios for the sample are comparable to or even
lower than these error values, so that detections of lithium-6 can not safely
be claimed despite of the high resolving power (R ~ 95 000) and S/N (400-600).

parameters and from absorptive parts of loop integrals. The genuine vertex
contributions to the neutralino decay amplitudes are combined with two-loop
propagator-type corrections for the outgoing Higgs boson. In this way the
currently most precise prediction for this class of processes is obtained. The
numerical impact of the genuine vertex corrections is studied for several
examples of CP-conserving and CP-violating scenarios. We find that significant
effects on the decay widths and branching ratios are possible even in the
CP-conserving MSSM. In the CP-violating CPX benchmark scenario the corrections
to the decay width are found to be particularly large, namely, of order 45% for
a Higgs mass of 40 GeV. This parameter region of the CPX scenario where a very
light Higgs boson is unexcluded by present data is analysed in detail. We find
that in this parameter region, which will be difficult to cover by standard

superconductors (FeBSC) posits that the bosons responsible for electronic
pairing are spin-fluctuations with a wave vector spanning the hole Fermi
surfaces (FSs) near $\Gamma$ and the electron FSs near M points. So far all
FeBSC for which neutron data are available do demonstrate such excitations, and
the band structure calculations so far were finding quasi-nested FSs in all
FeBSC, providing for a peak in the spin susceptibility at the desired wave
vectors. However, the newest addition to the family, Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, has
been calculated to have a very complex FS with no visible quasi-nesting
features. It was argued therefore that this material does not fall under the
existing paradigm and calls for revisiting our current ideas about what is the
likely cause of superconductivity in FeBSC. In this paper, I show that the
visible complexity of the FS is entirely due to the V-derived electronic
states. Assuming that superconductivity in Sr$_{2}$VO$_{3}$FeAs, as in the
other FeBSC, originates in the FeAs layers, and the superconducting electrons
are sensitive to the susceptibility of the FeAs electronic subsystem, I
recalculate the bare susceptibility, weighting the electronic states with their
Fe character, and obtain a susceptibility that fully supports the existing
quasi-nesting model.

of the modulated wideband converter, a recently proposed system for sub-Nyquist
sampling of analog sparse signals. Attempting to quantify the conditioning of
the converter sensing matrix with existing approaches leads to unreasonable
rate requirements, due to the relatively small size of this matrix. We propose
a new conditioning criterion, named the expected restricted isometry property,
and derive theoretical guarantees for the converter to satisfy this property.
We then show that applying these conditions to popular binary sequences, such

equal to, or slightly smaller than our default masses. The maximum difference
is 0.16 dex for each parameter considered, and only 0.18 dex for the most

old stellar population superposed with a young component provide reasonable
fits to these SEDs using the models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003); however, using

surface density of galaxy dark matter halos, I look at what MOND has to say on
the subject. MOND, indeed, predicts a quasi-universal value of this quantity
for objects of all masses and of any internal structure, provided they are
mostly in the Newtonian regime; i.e., that their mean acceleration is at or
above a0. The predicted value is qSm, with Sm= a0/2 pi G= 138 solar masses per
square parsec for the nominal value of a0, and q a constant of order 1 that
depends only on the form of the MOND interpolating function. This gives in the
above units log(Sm)=2.14, which is consistent with that found by Doanato et al.
of 2.15+-0.2. MOND predicts, on the other hand, that this quasi-universal value
is not shared by objects with much lower mean accelerations. It permits halo
central surface densities that are arbitrarily small, if the mean acceleration
inside the object is small enough. However, for such low-surface-density
objects, MOND predicts a halo surface density that scales as the square root of
the baryonic one, and so the range of the former is much compressed relative to
the latter. This explains, in part, the finding of Donato et al. that the
universal value applies to low acceleration systems as well. Looking at
literature results for a number of the lowest surface-density disk galaxies
with rotation-curve analysis, I find that, indeed, their halo surface densities
are systematically lower then the above ""universal"" value. The prediction of Sm
as an upper limit, and accumulation value, of halo central surface densities,
pertains, unlike most other MOND predictions, to a pure ""halo"" property, not to
a relation between baryonic and ""dark matter"" properties.

constrain the star formation histories of these 24 micron selected star-forming

consistent with the star formation scenario that, most regions across the whole

average is their specific star formation rate (SSFR = SFR/Ms, Ms is the stellar
mass). Such a trend, called the 'SSFR downsizing' (SSFR-DS) phenomenon, is seen
for local and high-z (back to z~1-2) galaxy samples. We use observational data
related only to disc galaxies and explore the average SSFR change with z for
different masses. For Ms in the range ~10^9.5-10^10.5 Msun, the SSFR increases
with (1+z) to a power that barely depends on Ms, and at all z's smaller
galaxies have ever higher SSFRs. The latter strongly disagree with the LCDM
hierarchical mass accretion rates. By means of self-consistent models of disc
galaxy evolution inside growing LCDM halos, the effects that disc
feedback-driven outflows and gas re-accretion have on the galaxy SSFR histories
are explored. The parameters of the outflow and re-accretion schemes are tuned
to reproduce the z~0 Mh-Ms relation inferred from observations. In the case of
outflows only, the SSFR of individual model galaxies is roughly proportional to
(1+z)^2.2 for all the masses with a normalization factor that depends on mass
as Ms^0.1, i.e more massive galaxies have slightly larger SSFRs, contrary to
the observed strong SSFR-DS trend. For the re-accretion cases, the dependence
on z remains approximately the same as without re-infall, but the correlation
on Ms even increases for most of the reasonable values of the model parameters.
The comparison of models and observations in the SSFR-Ms plane at z~0 shows the
divergent trend in SSFR as lower are the masses (upsizing vs downsizing). We
explain why the models show the reported trends, and conclude that the SSFR-DS
for low-mass galaxies poses a challenge for LCDM-based disc galaxy evolution
models. (Abridged)

device construction zone by allowing ion sensing at potentially greater
distances. Using a remotely located passively gated single ion Geiger mode
avalanche diode (SIGMA) detector we have demonstrated 100% detection efficiency
at a distance of >75 um from the center of the collecting junction. This
detection efficiency is achieved with sensitivity to ~600 or fewer
electron-hole pairs produced by the implanted ion. Ion detectors with this
sensitivity and integrated with a thin dielectric, for example 5 nm gate oxide,
using low energy Sb implantation would have an end of range straggle of <2.5
nm. Significant reduction in false count probability is achieved by modifying
the ion beam set-up to allow for cryogenic operation of the SIGMA detector.
Using a detection window of 230 ns at 1 Hz, the probability of a false count
was measured as 1E-1 and 1E-4 for operation temperatures of 300K and 77K,
respectively. Low temperature operation and reduced false, dark, counts are
critical to achieving high confidence in single ion arrival. For the device
performance in this work, the confidence is calculated as a probability of >98%
for counting one and only one ion for a false count probability of 1E-4 at an
average ion number per gated window of 0.015.

together comprise the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project. We
systematically vary the parameters of the model to determine which physical
processes are dominant and which aspects of the model are robust. Generically,
we find that SF is limited by the build-up of dark matter haloes at high
redshift, reaches a broad maximum at intermediate redshift, then decreases as
it is quenched by lower cooling rates in hotter and lower density gas, gas
exhaustion, and self-regulated feedback from stars and black holes. The higher
redshift SF is therefore mostly determined by the cosmological parameters and
to a lesser extent by photo-heating from reionization. The location and height
of the peak in the SF history, and the steepness of the decline towards the
present, depend on the physics and implementation of stellar and black hole
feedback. Mass loss from intermediate-mass stars and metal-line cooling both
boost the SF rate at late times. Galaxies form stars in a self-regulated
fashion at a rate controlled by the balance between, on the one hand, feedback
from massive stars and black holes and, on the other hand, gas cooling and
accretion. Paradoxically, the SF rate is highly insensitive to the assumed SF
law. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: if the SF efficiency
is changed, then galaxies adjust their gas fractions so as to achieve the same
rate of production of massive stars. Self-regulated feedback from accreting
black holes is required to match the steep decline in the observed SF rate
below redshift two, although more extreme feedback from SF, for example in the
form of a top-heavy IMF at high gas pressures, can help.

spectrum of halo and relic and to investigate the physical properties of the
Beaver head-tail radio galaxy belonging to the cluster. In the radio halo, the
spectral index is steeper at the center and flatter at the locations of the
radio filaments, clearly detected at 25 cm. In the relics, the spectral index
flattens, moving away from the cluster center. For the Beaver radio galaxy, the
spectrum severely steepens from the head towards the end of the tail, because
of the energy losses suffered by the relativistic particles. In the 2 m map,
which is the first high-sensitivity image presented in the literature at such a
long wavelength, a new Mpc-size emission region is detected between the known
radio halo and the NW relic. Not detecting this feature in the more sensitive
85 cm observations implies that it must have a very steep spectrum (alpha <=
-2.6). The observational properties of the radio halo suggest that either we
are looking at a superposition of different structures (filaments in the
foreground plus real halo in the background) seen in projection across the
cluster center or that the halo is intrinsically peculiar. The newly detected
extended region to the NW of the halo could be considered as an asymmetric
extension of the halo itself. However, since radio halos are known in the
literature as structures showing a regular morphology, the new feature could
represent the first example of steep Mpc-size diffuse structures (MDS),

transitional disk LRLL 31 in the 2-3 Myr-old star forming region IC 348. Our
measurements show remarkable mid-infrared variability on timescales as short as
one week. The infrared continuum emission exhibits systematic
wavelength-dependent changes that suggest corresponding dynamical changes in
the inner disk structure and variable shadowing of outer disk material. We
propose several possible sources for the structural changes, including a
variable accretion rate or a stellar or planetary companion embedded in the
disk. Our results indicate that variability studies in the infrared can provide
important new constraints on protoplanetary disk behavior.

between the enclosed surface densities of luminous and dark matter in galaxies.

small-scale structure in the Ly-a forest from 40 high resolution, high
signal-to-noise, VLT spectra at z=2.2-4.2. We convolve each Ly-a forest
spectrum with a suitably chosen wavelet filter, which allows us to extract the
amount of small-scale structure in the forest as a function of position across
each spectrum. We compare these measurements with high resolution hydrodynamic
simulations of the Ly-a forest which track more than 2 billion particles. This
comparison suggests that the IGM temperature close to the cosmic mean density
(T_0) peaks near z=3.4, at which point it is greater than 20,000 K at 2-sigma
confidence. The temperature at lower redshift is consistent with the fall-off
expected from adiabatic cooling ($T_0 \propto (1+z)^2$), after the peak
temperature is reached near z=3.4. At z=4.2 our results favor a temperature of
T_0 = 15-20,000 K. However, owing mostly to uncertainties in the mean
transmitted flux at this redshift, a cooler IGM model with T_0 = 10,000 K is
only disfavored at the 2-sigma level here, although such cool IGM models are
strongly discrepant with the z ~ 3-3.4 measurement. We do not detect large
spatial fluctuations in the IGM temperature at any redshift covered by our data

excitations of clusters with singlet ground state are examined using
simulations in the valence bond basis. The triplet is shown to affect
predominantly sites on the classical monomer regions. The number of sites

much smaller dynamic exponent, consistent with quantum rotor (or possibly

influence of the tree structure and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution

Specifically, the error exponent corresponding to the event that the estimated
tree structure differs from the actual unknown tree structure of the
distribution is analyzed. Finding the error exponent reduces to a least-squares
problem in the very noisy learning regime. In this regime, it is shown that the
extremal tree structure that minimizes the error exponent is the star for any
fixed set of correlation coefficients on the edges of the tree. If the
magnitudes of all the correlation coefficients are less than 0.63, it is also
shown that the tree structure that maximizes the error exponent is the Markov
chain. In other words, the star and the chain graphs represent the hardest and
the easiest structures to learn in the class of tree-structured Gaussian
graphical models. This result can also be intuitively explained by correlation
decay: pairs of nodes which are far apart, in terms of graph distance, are
unlikely to be mistaken as edges by the maximum-likelihood estimator in the
asymptotic regime.

uniqueness} that are required in previous works. This leaves open the
possibility for our schema to be sufficiently accurate even for $k<d$.
  The set up for establishing correlation decay is as follows: Given
$G(n,d/n)$, we alter the graph structure in some specific region $\Lambda$ of
the graph by deleting edges between vertices of $\Lambda$. Then we show that
the effect of this change on the marginals of Gibbs distribution, diminishes as
we move away from $\Lambda$. Our approach is novel and suggests a new context
for the study of deterministic counting algorithms.

we perform detailed photoionization modeling of the infrared lines. Our
analysis suggests that the luminosity and morphology of the [O IV] 25.89 $\mu$m
emission line is consistent with photoionization by the soft X-ray and far
ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from the accretion disk of the binary system and
inconsistent with narrow beaming. We show that the emission nebula is
matter-bounded both in the line of sight direction and to the east, and
probably radiation-bounded to the west. A bolometric luminosity in excess of
10$^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ would be needed to produce the measured [O IV] flux. We
use modeling and previously published studies to conclude that shocks likely
contribute very little, if at all, to the high-ionization line fluxes observed
in the Holmberg II ULX. Additionally, we find that the spectral type of the
companion star has a surprisingly strong effect on the predicted strength of
the [O IV] emission. This finding could explain the origin of [O IV] in some
starburst systems containing black hole binaries.

holds for the anti-unitary operators of the extended group. We also improve on
Neuhauser's result by giving explicit formulae for the (anti-)unitary

the eigenvalues and the order of an arbitrary (anti-)symplectic matrix. The
fact that in prime power dimension the matrix elements belong to a field means
that this can be done using the same techniques which are used to find the
eigenvalues of a matrix defined over the reals-including the use of an
extension field (the analogue of the complex numbers) when the eigenvalues are
not in the base field. We then give an application of these results to
SIC-POVMs (symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued
measures). We show that in prime dimension our results can be used to find a
natural basis for the eigenspace of the Zauner unitary in which SIC-fiducials
are expected to lie. Finally, we apply our results to the MUB cycling problem.

model describes interactions between three diabatic electronic states, each of
which can be associated with a valence bond structure. Monomethine dyes are
characterized by a charge-transfer resonance; the indeterminacy of the
single-double bonding structure dictated by the resonance is reflected in a
duality of photoisomerization pathways corresponding to the different methine
bonds. The possible multiplicity of decay channels complicates mechanistic
models of the effect of the environment on fluorescent quantum yields, as well
as coherent control strategies. We examine the extent and topology of
intersection seams between the electronic states of the dye, and how they
relate to charge localization and selection between different decay pathways.
We find that intersections between the S1 and S0 surfaces only occur for large
twist angles. In contrast, S2/S1 intersections can occur near the Franck-Condon
region. When the molecule has left-right symmetry, all intersections are
associated with con- or dis-rotations and never with single bond twists. For
asymmetric molecules (i.e. where the bridge couples more strongly to one end)
then the S2 and S1 surfaces bias torsion about different bonds. Charge
localization and torsion pathway biasing are correlated. We relate our
observations to several recent experimental and theoretical results, which have
been obtained for dyes with similar structure.

of the shallow decay phase and the isotropic X-ray luminosity at t2. We infer
the properties of the progenitor stars based on a model proposed by Kumar et
al. who suggested that both the prompt gamma-rays and the X-ray afterglows are
due to the accretions of different layers of materials of the GRB progenitor
star by a central black hole (BH). We find that most of the derived masses of
the core layers are 0.1-5 solar mass with a radius of 10^8-10^10 cm. The
rotation parameter is correlated with the burst duration, being consistent with
the expectation of collapsar models. The estimated radii and the masses of the
fall-back materials for the envelope layers are 10^10-10^12 cm and 10^-3~1
solar mass, respectively. The average accretion rates in the shallow decay
phase are correlated with those in the prompt gamma-ray phase, but they are
much lower. The derived radii of the envelope are smaller than the photospheric
radii of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. It is interesting that the assembled mass
density profile for the bursts in our sample is also well consistent with the
simulation for a pre-supernova star with 25 solar mass.

its behavior numerically. It turns out that the entropy perturbations cannot be
neglected in N-flation, because the amplitude of entropy components is
approximately in the same order as the adiabatic one at the end of inflation
$T^2_{\ma{R}\ma{S}}\sim\ma{O}(1)$. The spectral index $n_S$ is calculated and
it becomes smaller after the entropy modes are taken into account, i.e., the
spectrum becomes redder, compared to the pure adiabatic case. Finally we study
the modified consistency relation of N-flation, and find that the

emission. Our 1.5"" resolution 1.3 mm molecular line images reveal substantial
hot-core line emission toward SMA1 and to a lesser degree SMA2. We find CH3OH

of the outflow emanating from the SMA1 region. The LSR velocities of SMA1,
SMA2, and SMA4 all differ by 1-2 km/s. Outflow activity from SMA1, SMA2, SMA4,

strengths with overall abundance [Fe/H]. For the 41 M22 member stars that lie

that is substantially broader than that expected from the observed errors
alone. We argue that this broad distribution cannot be the result of
differential reddening. Instead we conclude that, as has long been suspected,
M22 is similar to omega Cen in having an intrinsic dispersion in heavy element
abundance. The observed M22 abundance distribution rises sharply to a peak at
[Fe/H] = -1.9 with a broad tail to higher abundances: the highest abundance

maximal extreme sets in $G$. This was later extended to graphs without perfect

instabilities of dipolar fermions on the two-dimensional square lattice (in the
$x-y$ plane) with dipoles pointing to the $z$ direction. We determine the phase
diagram using two complimentary methods, the Hatree-Fock mean field theory and
the linear response analysis of compressibility. Both give consistent results.
In addition to the staggered ($\pi$, $\pi$) density wave, over a finite range
of densities and hopping parameters, the ground state of the system first
becomes nematic and then smectic, when the dipolar interaction strength is
increased. Both phases are characterized by the same broken four-fold (C$_4$)
rotational symmetry. The difference is that the nematic phase has a closed
Fermi surface but the smectic does not. The transition from the nematic to the
smectic phase is associated with a jump in the nematic order parameter. This
jump is closely related to the van Hove singularities. We derive the kinetic
equation for collective excitations in the normal isotropic phase and find that

density-functional theory. It is demonstrated that C2H4 can be adsorbed on
small gold clusters in two different configurations, corresponding to the pi-

the di-sigma mode over all considered cluster sizes n, with the exception of
the neutral C2H4-Au5 system. A striking difference is found in the
size-dependence of the adsorption energy of C2H4 bonded to the neutral gold

electronic shell effects in the di-sigma mode of ethylene adsorption on neutral
gold clusters is demonstrated. It is shown that the interaction of C2H4 with

Kac-Kubilius model suggests that the distribution of values of a given additive

accurate (in a large deviation sense) when one is looking at values of the

  In the second part of the paper, we are motivated by a question of Elliott,
to understand how much the distribution of values of the additive function on

additive function on all of the integers. For example, our main theorem,

jets are assumed as initial conditions in some numerical simulations that
demonstrate that SMW jets can expel the rest of the collapsing star. The
original fast narrow jets must deposit their energy inside the star via shock
waves, and form two hot bubbles that accelerate a much larger mass to form SMW
jets. To prevent the jets from penetrating through the still infalling gas and
escape instead of forming the hot bubbles, the jets should encounter fresh
infalling gas. This condition is met if the jets' axis changes its direction.
The exact condition is derived. In addition, to maintain a small neutrino
cooling the fast narrow jets must be shocked at a distance r>1000 km from the
core, such that most of the post-shock energy is in radiation, and temperature
is not too high. The scenario proposed here was shown to be able to suppress
star formation in newly formed galaxies, and in forming SMW jets in cooling
flow clusters of galaxies and in planetary nebulae. Namely, I suggest that NSs

the mass available for accretion by the same mechanism that super-massive BHs
shut off their own growth, as well as that of their host bulge, in young
galaxies.

The new theorem is written in terms of posterior probabilities, which are
introduced via the Bayes theorem. In usual fluctuation theorems, a forward path
and its time reversal play an important role, so that a microscopically
reversible condition is essential. In contrast, the microscopically reversible
condition is not necessary in the new theorem. It is shown that the new theorem

strategically chosen hidden virtual network by placing a wiretap on a single

greatest probability that the wiretapper can secure for hitting the virtual

underlying graph.
  We efficiently compute a unique partition of the edges of the graph, called
the prime-partition, and find the set of pure strategies of the hider that are
best responses against every maxmin strategy of the wiretapper. Using these
special pure strategies of the hider, which we call
omni-connected-spanning-subgraphs, we define a partial order on the elements of
the prime-partition. From the partial order, we obtain a linear number of
simple two-variable inequalities that define the maxmin-polytope, and a
characterization of its extreme points.
  Our definition of the partial order allows us to find all equilibrium
strategies of the wiretapper that minimize the number of pure best responses of
the hider. Among these strategies, we efficiently compute the unique strategy
that maximizes the least punishment that the hider incurs for playing a pure
strategy that is not a best response. Finally, we show that this unique
strategy is the nucleolus of the recently studied simple cooperative spanning
connectivity game.

Except for select cases however, analytical expressions do not exist for a
diffusion process' transitional probabilities. It is proposed that the cumulant
truncation procedure can be applied to predict the evolution of the cumulants
of the system. These predictions may be subsequently used within the
saddlepoint procedure to approximate the transitional probabilities. An
approximation to the likelihood of the diffusion system is then easily derived.
The method is applicable for a wide-range of diffusion systems - including
multivariate, irreducible diffusion systems that existing estimation schemes
struggle with. Not only is the accuracy of the saddlepoint comparable with the
Hermite expansion - a popular approximation to a diffusion system's
transitional density - it also appears to be less susceptible to increasing
lags between successive samplings of the diffusion process. Furthermore, the
saddlepoint is more stable in regions of the parameter space that are far from
the maximum likelihood estimates. Hence, the saddlepoint method can be
naturally incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) routine in
order to provide reliable estimates and credibility intervals of the diffusion
model's parameters. The method is applied to fit the Heston model to daily
observations of the S&P 500 and VIX indices from December 2009 to November

of the distribution is independent of optical ellipticity, optical

the formalism of stochastic growth equations on growing domains. This framework
reveals a number of dynamic features arising during surface growth. For fast
growth, dilution, which spatially reorders the incoming matter, is responsible
for the transmission of correlations. Its effects include the erasing of memory
with respect to the initial condition, a partial attenuation of geometrically
originated instabilities, and the restoring of universality in some special
cases in which the critical exponents depend on the parameters of the equation
of motion. In this sense, dilution rends the dynamics more similar to the usual
one of planar systems. This fast growth regime is also characterized by the
spatial decorrelation of the interface, which in the case of radially growing
interfaces naturally originates rapid roughening and scale dependent
fractality, and suggests the advent of a self-similar fractal dimension. The
center of mass fluctuations of growing clusters are also studied, and our
analysis suggests the possible non-applicability of usual scalings to the long

It is found that this model can successfully explain the long plateaus in the

the plateaus should be due to the rapid decline of the emission power of the

galaxies (SFG) and passive normal galaxies (NG), i.e., no emission lines
observed, using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data (SDSS) (Adelman-McCarthy, 2008).
The stellar component of the observed spectra has been extracted using
STARLIGHT (Cid Fernandes et al., 2004), which fits an observed spectrum with a
model (template) spectrum obtained by combining a library of pre-defined simple
stellar populations spectra, with distinct ages and metallicities. The
resulting template spectra for the different samples of galaxies have been
compared to determine the features of the stellar emission component and to
evaluate the presence and intensity of the star formation in the nuclear
regions of different families of galaxies. From a first qualitative analysis it
results that the shape of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of S2G and NG
is very similar, while that of SFG is characterized by a strong blue excess.
The presence of the 4000 A break in the spectra of S2G and NG together with the
lack of a strong blue continuum clearly indicate the absence of ongoing star
formation in the circumnuclear regions of S2G and obviously of NG. Anyway
traces of a recent star formation history are evident in the spectra of S2G
galaxies, which show a 4000 A break systematically shallower than in NG.

a collection of concentric circular rings, and computing the torques in the
non-linear regime, we show that stable, strongly warped precessing equilibria
are possible. These solutions exist for a wide range of disk-to-black hole mass
ratios $M_d/M_{bh}$, can span large warp angles of up to $\pm\sim 120\deg$,
have inner and outer boundaries, and extend over a radial range of a factor of

such that in good approximation $\phidot/\Omega\propto M_d/M_{bh}$ where

characteristic orbital frequency in the disk. Stability was determined using
linear perturbation theory and, in a few cases, confirmed by numerical

that highly warped disks near black holes can persist for long times without

calculations were performed to calculate and analyze the electric field

family shows a contraction of the lattice parameters with shorter rare-earth
(RE)-As bond distances, an increased thickness of the As-Fe$_2$-As layer, and
less distorted Fe-As$_4$ tetrahedra. The $^{75}$As quadrupole frequencies are
enhanced with respect to the La analogs. This is due to a more prolate As $4p$
electron distribution mainly caused by the reduced lattice parameters and not
by the presence of Nd $4f$ electrons. A non-negligible hyperfine coupling
between the $^{75}$As nuclei and the Nd $4f$ states indicates a weak coupling
between the REO and FeAs layer and possibly opens the channel for a

relatively dark patches on the surface of the Sun, and are caused by
concentrations of magnetism which impede the flow of heat from deep inside the
Sun up to its othewise brilliant surface. The spots are not permanent: the
total number of spots on the Sun varies cyclically in time, with a period of
about eleven years, associated with which there appear to be variations in our
climate. When there are many spots, it is more dangerous for spacecraft to
operate. The cause of the spots is not well understood; nor is it known for
sure how they die. Their structure beneath the surface of the Sun is in some
dispute, although much is known about their properties at the surface,
including an outward material flow which was discovered by John Evershed
observing the Sun from Kodaikanal a hundred years ago. I shall give you a

recently. In this paper, we strictly define a class of networks, namely
effective networks, which are synchronizable and orientable networks. We can
prove that all the effective networks with the same size have the same spectra,
and are of the best synchronizability according to the master stability
analysis. However, it is found that the synchronization time for different
effective networks can be quite different. Further analysis show that the key
ingredient affecting the synchronization time is the maximal depth of an
effective network: the larger depth results in a longer synchronization time.
The secondary factor is the number of links. The more links connecting the
nodes in the same layer (horizontal links) will lead to longer synchronization
time, while the increasing number of links connecting nodes in neighboring
layers (vertical links) will accelerate the synchronization. Our findings
provide insights into the roles of horizontal and vertical links in
synchronizing process, and suggest that the spectral analysis is helpful yet
insufficient for the understanding of network synchronization.

exciting property of invisibility, which are based on a solid theory of
transformation optics and quasi-conformal mapping. Two kinds of cloaks have
been proposed: free-space cloaks, which can render objects in free space
invisible to incident radiation, and carpet cloaks (or ground cloaks), which
can hide objects under the conducting ground. The first free-space and carpet
cloaks were realized in the microwave frequencies using metamaterials. The
free-space cloak was composed of resonant metamaterials, and hence had
restriction of narrow bandwidth and high loss; the carpet cloak was made of
non-resonant metamaterials, which have broad bandwidth and low loss. However,
the carpet cloak has a severe restriction of large size compared to the cloaked
object. The above restrictions become the bottlenecks to the real applications
of free-space and carpet cloaks. Here we report the first experimental
demonstration of broadband and low-loss directive free-space cloak and
compact-sized carpet cloak based on a recent theoretical study. Both cloaks are
realized using non-resonant metamaterials in the microwave frequency, and good
invisibility properties have been observed in experiments. This approach
represents a major step towards the real applications of invisibility cloaks.

consisting of Thick Gas Electron Multipliers (THGEM) coated with CsI
photocathode, operated in atmospheric Ne/CH4 and Ne/CF4 mixtures. We report on
the photoelectron extraction efficiency from the photocathode into these gas
mixtures, and on the photoelectron collection efficiency into the THGEM holes.
Full collection efficiency was reached in all gases investigated, in some cases
at relatively low multiplication. High total detector gains for UV photons, in
excess of 10^5, were reached at relatively low operation voltages with a single
THGEM element. We discuss the photon detection efficiency in the context of
possible application to RICH.

perturbations generated by the curvaton, assuming a curvaton potential that may
deviate slightly from the quadratic one, and parameterizing the background
fluid density as \rho\propto a^{-\alpha}, where a is the scale factor, and
\alpha depends on the background fluid. It turns out that the more there is
deviation from the quadratic case, the more pronounced is the dependence of the
curvature perturbation on \alpha. We also show that the background can have a
significant effect on the nonlinearity parameters f_NL and g_NL. As an example,
if at the onset of the curvaton oscillation there is a dimension 6 contribution
to the potential at 5 % level and the energy fraction of the curvaton to the
total one at the time of its decay is at 1 %, we find variations \Delta f_NL
\sim \mathcal{O}(10) and \Delta g_NL \sim \mathcal{O}(10^4) between matter and
radiation dominated backgrounds. Moreover, we demonstrate that there is a
relation between f_NL and g_NL that can be used to probe the form of the
curvaton potential and the equation of state of the background fluid.

Plus (2011) 126: 79",,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently Abramowicz and Bajtlik [ArXiv: 0905.2428 (2009)] have studied the
twin paradox in Schwarzschild spacetime. Considering circular motion they
showed that the twin with a non-vanishing 4-acceleration is older than his
brother at the reunion and argued that in spaces that are asymptotically
Minkowskian there exists an absolute standard of rest determining which twin is
oldest at the reunion. Here we show that with vertical motion in Schwarzschild
spacetime the result is opposite: The twin with a non-vanishing 4-acceleration
is younger. We also deduce the existence of a new relativistic time effect,
that there is either a time dilation or an increased rate of time associated
with a clock moving in a rotating frame. This is in fact a first order effect
in the velocity of the clock, and must be taken into account if the situation
presented by Abramowicz and Bajtlik is described from the rotating rest frame
of one of the twins. Our analysis shows that this effect has a Machian
character since the rotating state of a frame depends upon the motion of the
cosmic matter due to the inertial dragging it causes. We argue that a
consistent formulation and resolution of the twin paradox makes use of the
general principle of relativity and requires the introduction of an extended
model of the Minkowski spacetime. In the extended model Minkowski spacetime is
supplied with a cosmic shell of matter with radius equal to its own
Schwarzschild radius, so that there is perfect inertial dragging inside the
shell.

allocating a single item via an auction when bidders place very different
values on the item. We formulate this as the problem of prior-free auction and
focus on designing a simple mechanism that always allocates the item. Rather
than designing sophisticated pricing methods like prior literature, we design
better allocation methods. In particular, we propose quasi-proportional
allocation methods in which the probability that an item is allocated to a
bidder depends (quasi-proportionally) on the bids.
  We prove that corresponding games for both all-pay and winners-pay
quasi-proportional mechanisms admit pure Nash equilibria and this equilibrium
is unique. We also give an algorithm to compute this equilibrium in polynomial
time. Further, we show that the revenue of the auctioneer is promisingly high
compared to the ultimate, i.e., the highest value of any of the bidders, and
show bounds on the revenue of equilibria both analytically, as well as using
experiments for specific quasi-proportional functions. This is the first known
revenue analysis for these natural mechanisms (including the special case of
proportional mechanism which is common in network resource allocation
problems).

spectrum, constitutes an extraordinary opportunity to explore a largely unknown
aspect of our universe. Key scientific goals are the identification of the
sources of ultra high energy particles, the measurement of their spectra and
the study of galactic and local intergalactic magnetic fields. Ultra high
energy particles might, also, carry evidence of unknown physics or of exotic
particles relics of the early universe. To meet this challenge a significant
increase in the integrated exposure is required. This implies a new class of
experiments with larger acceptances and good understanding of the systematic
uncertainties. Space based observatories can reach the instantaneous aperture
and the integrated exposure necessary to systematically explore the ultra high
energy universe. In this paper, after briefly summarising the science case of
the mission, we describe the scientific goals and requirements of the SEUSO
concept. We then introduce the SEUSO observational approach and describe the
main instrument and mission features. We conclude discussing the expected

Let $F$ be an embedded, closed and orientable surface of genus $g$, close to a
minimal surface in the cover $M'$, splitting $M'$ into a disjoint union of $q$
handlebodies and compression bodies. We show that there exists a fiber in the
complement of $F$ provided that $d$, $q$ and $g$ satisfy some inequality
involving an explicit constant $k$ depending only on the volume and the
injectivity radius of $M$. In particular, this theorem applies to a Heegaard
splitting of a finite covering $M'$, giving an explicit lower bound for the
genus of a strongly irreducible Heegaard splitting of $M'$. Applying the main
theorem to the setting of a circular decomposition associated to a non trivial
homology class of $M$ gives sufficient conditions for this homology class to
correspond to a fibration over the circle. Similar methods lead also to a
sufficient condition for an incompressible embedded surface in $M$ to be a

extended systems of physical, chemical, and biological nature. In the presence
of a small perturbation, the spiral wave's centre of rotation and fiducial
phase may change over time, i.e. the spiral wave drifts. In linear
approximation, the velocity of the drift is proportional to the convolution of
the perturbation with the spiral's Response Functions (RFs), which are the
eigenfunctions of the adjoint linearized operator corresponding to the critical
eigenvalues $\lambda = 0, \pm i\omega$. Here we demonstrate that the response
functions give quantitatively accurate prediction of the drift velocities due
to a variety of perturbations: a time dependent, periodic perturbation
(inducing resonant drift); a rotational symmetry breaking perturbation
(inducing electrophoretic drift); and a translational symmetry breaking
perturbation (inhomogeneity induced drift) including drift due to a gradient,
step-wise and localised inhomogeneity. We predict the drift velocities using
the response functions in FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) and Barkley models, and compare
them with the velocities obtained in direct numerical simulations. In all cases
good quantitative agreement is demonstrated.
