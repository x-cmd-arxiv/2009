stellar mass density of the universe when it was only ~750 Myr old. We combine
the very deep optical to near-Infrared photometry from the HST ACS and NICMOS
cameras with mid-Infrared Spitzer IRAC imaging available through the GOODS
program. After carefully removing the flux from contaminating foreground
sources we have obtained reliable photometry in the 3.6 and 4.5 micron IRAC
channels. The spectral shapes of these sources, including their rest frame
optical colors, strongly support their being at z~7 with a mean photometric
redshift of <z>=7.2+/-0.5. We use Bruzual & Charlot (2003) synthetic stellar
population models to constrain their stellar masses and star formation
histories. We find stellar masses that range over 0.1 -12x10^9 M_sol and
average ages from 20 Myr to up to 425 Myr with a mean of ~300 Myr, suggesting
that in some of these galaxies most of the stars were formed at z>8 (and
probably at z>~10). The best fits to the observed SEDs are consistent with
little or no dust extinction, in agreement with recent results at z~4-8. The
star formation rates (SFR) are in the range from 5-20 M_sol/yr. From this
sample we measure a stellar mass density of 6.6_{-3.3}^{+5.4}x10^5 M_sol/Mpc^3
to a limit of M_{UV,AB}<-20 (or 0.4 L*(z=3)). Combined with a fiducial lower
limit for their ages (80 Myr) this implies a maximum SFR density of 0.008
M_sol/yr/Mpc^3. This is well below the critical level needed to reionize the
universe at z~8 using standard assumptions. However, this result is based on
luminous sources (>L*) and does not include the dominant contribution of the
fainter galaxies. Strikingly, we find that the specific SFR is constant from
z~7 to z~2 but drops substantially at more recent times.

bottleneck can be alleviated, by calculating all expansion integrals

study the physical properties of the system in thermodynamic equilibrium and
develop both perturbative and non-perturbative methods to solve the model. The
perturbation theory is formulated as a loop expansion in terms of two-particle

a static approximation, and (ii) via Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Results
for the Matsubara correlations at two-loop order perturbation theory are in
good agreement with those of the Quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
Characteristic low-temperature anomalies of the specific heat are reproduced,
both in the non-perturbative static approximation, and from a three-loop

far relies on using Matsubara correlations at two-loop order in the three-loop

conspicuous signature of their restarted activity. Observations indicate that
in the majority of double-double radio sources (DDRS), the span of the radio
lobes is larger than 0.7 Mpc. This lower limit is also suggested by theory.
However, it seemed likely that the apparent core of B0818+214, a radio galaxy
with an overall linear size of its radio structure below that limit, could
harbour a compact double well aligned with the outer lobes so that the whole
object would fulfil the criteria of a DDRS. Here, we present evidence that the
central component of B0818+214, when magnified through the EVN+MERLIN 18-cm
observations, shows two FR II-like lobes. As the separation of the inner lobes
is not greater than 5.7 kpc, they are immersed in the ISM of the host galaxy.
This circumstance is the likely reason why the inner double has become visible,
despite the predictions of the theory according to which B0818+214 as a whole
is too small for a new double to develop inside the cocoon inflated during the
previous active phase. Moreover, we speculate that its host galaxy is not
active at the moment and so the inner double may be in the coasting phase often
observed in other medium-sized symmetric objects with intermittent activity. It
could be, therefore, that two different mechanisms of accretion disk
instabilities, ionisation and radiation-pressure driven, may be independently
responsible for triggering active phases, manifesting as the outer and the
inner doubles, respectively.

remarkably similar to the so-called 'hypernova' SN 2002ap. In contrast, the
spectra of SNe 2007gr and 2002ap show marked differences, not least in their
respective expansion velocities. We attribute these differences primarily to
the density profiles of their progenitor stars at the time of explosion i.e. a
more compact star for SN 2007gr compared to SN 2002ap. From the
quasi-bolometric light curve of SN 2007gr, we estimate that 0.076 $\pm$ 0.010
Msun of 56Ni was produced in the explosion. Our near-infrared (IR) spectra
clearly show the onset and disappearance of the first overtone of carbon
monoxide (CO) between ~70 to 175 days relative to B-band maximum. The detection
of the CO molecule implies that ionised He was not microscopically mixed within
the carbon/oxygen layers. From the optical spectra, near-IR light curves, and
colour evolution, we find no evidence for dust condensation in the ejecta out
to about 400 days. Given the combination of unprecedented temporal coverage,

fluctuations by adding auxiliary gauge fields and appropriate constraints. The
Hamiltonian is quadratic in these fields and hence can be treated as a harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian, with a ground state that is connected to the Halperin

fluctuation of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) using deep Spitzer IRAC
observations. The self-calibration we apply removes a strong instrumental
signal from the fluctuations which would otherwise corrupt our results. The
procedures and results for masking bright sources, and modeling faint sources
down to levels set by the instrumental noise are presented. Various tests are
performed to demonstrate that the resulting power spectra of these fields are
not dominated by instrumental or procedural effects. These tests indicate that
the large scale (>~30') fluctuations that remain in the deepest fields are not
directly related to the galaxies that are bright enough to be individually
detected. We provide the parameterization of these power spectra in terms of
separate instrument noise, shot noise, and power law components. Our
measurements of spatial fluctuations of the CIB intensity indicate the mean
emission from the objects producing the fluctuations is quite low (>~1 nW m-2
sr-1 at 3-5 micron), and thus consistent with current gamma-ray absorption
constraints. The source of the fluctuations may be high-z Population III
objects, or a more local component of very low luminosity objects with
clustering properties that differ from the resolved galaxies. Finally, we
discuss the prospects of the upcoming space-based surveys to directly measure
the epochs inhabited by the populations producing these source-subtracted CIB
fluctuations, and to isolate the individual fluxes of these populations.

diffusive properties of the flow field or perform complex calculations. Instead
our method is based on the collective behavior of autonomous individuals
following simple social interaction rules which are modified according to the

surface could influence the regolith, as might be observed via optical
Transient Lunar Phenomena (TLPs) and related effects. We touch on several
processes, but concentrate on low and high flow rate extremes, perhaps the most
likely. We model explosive outgassing for the smallest gas overpressure at the
regolith base that releases the regolith plug above it. This disturbance's
timescale and affected area are consistent with observed TLPs; we also discuss
other effects. For slow flow, escape through the regolith is prolonged by low
diffusivity. Water, found recently in deep magma samples, is unique among
candidate volatiles, capable of freezing between the regolith base and surface,
especially near the lunar poles. For major outgassing sites, we consider the
possible accumulation of water ice. Over geological time ice accumulation can
evolve downward through the regolith. Depending on gases additional to water,
regolith diffusivity might be suppressed chemically, blocking seepage and
forcing the ice zone to expand to larger areas, up to square km scales, again,
particularly at high latitudes. We propose an empirical path forward, wherein
current and forthcoming technologies provide controlled, sensitive probes of
outgassing. The optical transient/outgassing connection, addressed via
Earth-based remote sensing, suggests imaging and/or spectroscopy, but aspects
of lunar outgassing might be more covert, as indicated above. TLPs betray some

  CoO Shell Nanoparticles",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The utility of nanoscaled ferromagnetic particles requires both stabilized
moments and maximized switching speeds. During reversal, the spatial modulation
of the nanoparticle magnetization evolves in time, and the energy differences
between each new configuration are accomodated by the absorption or emission
spin waves with different wavelengths and energy profiles. The switching speed
is limited by how quickly this spin wave energy is dissipated. We present here
the first observation of dispersing spin waves in a nanoscaled system, using
neutron scattering to detect spin waves in the CoO shells of exchange biased Co
core- CoO shell nanoparticles. Their dispersion is little affected by finite
size effects, but the spectral weight shifts to energies and wave vectors which
increase with decreasing system size. Core-shell coupling leads to a
substantial enhancement of the CoO spin wave population above its conventional
thermal level, suggesting a new mechanism for dissipating core switching
energy.

this possibility we shall here discuss two systems where such emergence of a

require improbably large increases in rho(H_2) and a decrease in the MGDR with
lookback time that is inconsistent with observations. Allowing the H_2 used in
star formation to be replenished by HI does not alleviate the problem because
observations show that there is very little evolution of rho(HI) from z = 0 to
z = 4. We show that to be consistent with observational constraints, star
formation on cosmic timescales must be fueled by intergalactic ionized gas,
which may come from either accretion of gas through cold (but ionized) flows or
from ionized gas associated with accretion of dark matter halos. We constrain
the rate at which the extraglactic ionized gas must be converted into HI and
ultimately into H_2. The ionized gas inflow rate roughly traces the SFRD: about
1 - 2 x 10^8 M_sun Gyr^-1 Mpc^-3 from z ~ 1 - 4, decreasing by about an order
of magnitude from z=1 to z=0 with details depending largely on MGDR(t). All
models considered require the volume averaged density of rho(H_2) to increase
by a factor of 1.5 - 10 to z ~ 1.5 over the currently measured value. Because
the molecular gas must reside in galaxies, it implies that galaxies at high z
must, on average, be more molecule rich than they are at the present epoch,
which is consistent with observations. These quantitative results, derived
solely from observations, agree well with cosmological simulations.

detected in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey using the ultra-deep
70um and 24um Spitzer observations taken in this field. We rely on stacking
analyses of the 70um data to characterise the average 70um properties of the
X-ray sources. Using Spitzer-IRS data of the Swift-BAT sample of z~0 active
galactic nuclei (hereafter, AGNs), we show that the 70um/24um flux ratio can
distinguish between AGN-dominated and starburst-dominated systems out to z~1.5.
  From stacking analysis we find that both high redshift and z~0 AGNs follow
the same tendency toward warmer 70um/24um colours with increasing X-ray
luminosity (L_X). We also show that the 70um flux can be used to determine the
infrared (8-1000um) luminosities of high redshift AGNs. We use this information
to show that L_X=10^{42-43} erg/s AGNs at high redshifts (z=1-2) have infrared
to X-ray luminosity ratios (hereafter, L_IR/L_X) that are, on average,
4.7_{-2.0}^{+10.2} and 12.7^{+7.1}_{-2.6} times higher than AGNs with similar
X-ray luminosities at z=0.5-1 and z~0, respectively. By comparison, we find
that the L_IR/L_X ratios of L_X=10^{43-44} erg/s AGNs remain largely unchanged
across this same redshift interval. We explore the consequences that these
results may have on the identification of distant, potentially Compton thick
AGNs using L_IR/L_X ratios. We discuss possible scenarios for the observed
increase in the L_IR/L_X ratio with redshift, including changes in the dust
covering factor of AGNs and/or the star formation rates of their host galaxies.
Finally, we show how deep observations to be undertaken by the Herschel Space
Observatory will enable us to discriminate between these proposed scenarios and
also identify Compton-thick AGNs at high redshifts.

for 14 galaxies, from which we derived the gradients in age, total metallicity

galaxies studied in our previous VIMOS work (Rawle et al 2008). We observe a
mean metallicity gradient of -0.13 +/- 0.04 per dex and, in common with the
findings of previous studies, galaxies with log(sigma) > 2.1 have a sizeable
intrinsic scatter in metallicity gradient. The mean log(age/Gyr) gradient is
-0.02 +/- 0.06 per dex, although several galaxies have significant positive or
negative age gradients. The mean gradient in alpha-element enhancement is -0.10
+/- 0.04 per dex. We find that stellar population gradients are primarily
related to the central metallicity: early-type galaxies with super-solar
centres have steep negative metallicity gradients and positive age gradients;
those with solar metallicity centres have negligible [Z/H] gradients and
negative age gradients. There is a strong observed anti-correlation between the
gradients in age and metallicity. While a part of this trend can be attributed
to the correlation of measurement errors, we demonstrate that there is an
underlying intrinsic relation. For the Shapley galaxies, B-R colour gradients
predicted from spectroscopic age and metallicity generally agree well with
those measured directly from photometry.

measured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak, a dip around 4 kpc, two
distinct flat parts and an increase in the outermost regions. Except for the
innermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very
strong warp of the HI disc is evidenced. The central regions appear less
inclined than the average disc inclination, while the outer regions appear more
inclined. Mass distribution models by LCDM NFW, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal
dark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to
reproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are
measured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed
within a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 +/- 0.5) x 10^11 Msol. The dark matter
component is almost 4 times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this
radius. A total mass of 1.0 x 10^12 Msol is derived inside the virial radius.
New HI structures are discovered in the datacube, like the detection of up to
five HI components per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies.
The most remarkable new HI structures are thin HI spurs and an external arm in
the disc outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps
is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the
galaxy and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its
kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disc. Both these HI
perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions.

high Lya/Halpha and Halpha/Hbeta line ratios. We consider different
possibilities for the geometry of the dust around the emitting sources. We find
that also a uniform mixture of sources and dust does not reproduce the observed
line ratios. Instead, these are well reproduced by a clumpy dust screen. This
more realistic treatment of the geometry results in extinction corrected
(Lya/Halpha)_C values consistent with Case B recombination theory, whereas a
uniform dust screen model would imply values (Lya/Halpha)_C higher than 8.7.
Our analysis shows that there is no need to invoke ""ad-hoc"" multi phase media

described by an optically-thin thermal plasma with the electron temperature of
0.6 keV and several additional Lyman lines. We robustly detect, for the first
time, strong radiative recombination continua (RRC) of H-like Si and S around
at 2.7 and 3.5 keV. The ionization temperatures of Si and S determined from the
intensity ratios of the RRC to He-like K-alpha line are 1.0 keV and 1.2 keV,
respectively. We thus find firm evidence for an extremely-overionized

scenario argued in previous work is not favored in our new results. We propose
that the highly-ionized gas were made at the initial phase of the SNR evolution
in dense regions around a massive progenitor, and the low electron temperature
is due to a rapid cooling by an adiabatic expansion.

galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on the
multi-wavelength photometric observations of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey
Bootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the AGN and Galaxy Evolution
Survey. Our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshift
range 0<~z<~1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0<~z<~5.58. We use our
templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they
are relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for AGNs are a strong
function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components.
Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are
well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error.
We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed
by Stern et al.(2005) and Lacy et al.(2004). We find that the Stern et
al.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a
strong host galaxy component and at z =~ 4.5, when the broad Halpha emission
line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by
low and intermediate redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al.(2004) criterion is not
affected by incompleteness at z =~ 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong
galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift star
forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color-color
distribution of sources in the upcoming WISE mission and define a color
criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We
estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these
criteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z >~ 3.4.

potential of the NFW form, relevant to galaxies. Cosmic rays naturally provide
the extra energy and/or momentum input to the system, needed for a transonic
wind solution in a gas with adiabatic index $\gamma=5/3$. We show that CRs can
effectively drive winds even when the thermal energy of the gas is lost due to
radiative cooling. These wind solutions predict an asymptotic wind speed
closely related to the circular velocity of the galaxy. Furthermore, the mass
outflow rate per unit star formation rate (eta_w) is predicted to be ~ 0.2-0.5
for massive galaxies, with masses $M \sim 10^{11}-10^{12} M_\odot$. We show
eta_w to be inversely proportional to the square of the circular velocity.
Magnetic fields at the $\mu$G levels are also required in these galaxies to
have a significant mass loss. A large eta_w for small mass galaxies implies
that CR driven outflows could provide a strong negative feedback to the star
formation in dwarf galaxies. Further, our results will also have important
implications to the metal enrichment of the IGM. These conclusions are
applicable to the class of free wind models where the source region is confined

two-dimensional perfect fluid of infinite extent. The shape-changes are
prescribed as functions of time satisfying constraints ensuring that they
result from the work of internal forces only: conditions necessary for the
locomotion to be termed self-propelled. The net rigid motion of the body
results from the exchange of momentum between these shape-changes and the
surrounding fluid.
  The aim of this paper is several folds: First, it contains a rigorous frame-
work for the study of animal locomotion in fluid. Our model differs from
previous ones mostly in that the number of degrees of freedom related to the
shape-changes is infinite. .
  Second, we are interested in making clear the connection between shape-
changes and internal forces. We prove that, when the number of degrees of
freedom relating to the shape-changes is finite, both choices are actually
equivalent in the sense that there is a one-to-one relation between
shape-changes and internal forces.
  Third, we show how the control problem consisting in associating to each
shape-change the resulting trajectory of the swimming body can be suitably
treated in the frame of geometric control theory. For any given shape-changes
producing a net displacement in the fluid (say, moving forward), we prove that
there exists other shape-changes arbitrarily close to the previous ones, that
leads to a completely different motion (for instance, moving backward): This
phenomenon will be called Moonwalking. Most of our results are illustrated by
numerical examples.

theory, there is no adjustable parameter in the model except the energy scale.
In this model, the equation-of-state (EOS) of the YMC dark energy, $w_y > -1$
and $w_y < -1$, can both be naturally realized. By studying the evolution of
various components in the model, we find that, in the early stage of the
universe, dark energy tracked the evolution of the radiation, i.e. $w_y \to
1/3$. However, in the late stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state
with $w_y = -1$, and the universe transits from matter-dominated into dark
energy dominated stage only at recently $z \sim 0.3$. These characters are
independent of the choice of the initial condition, and the cosmic coincidence
problem is avoided in the models. We also find that, if the possible
interaction between YMC and dust matter is considered, the late time attractor
solution may exist. In this case, the EOS of YMC must evolve from $w_y>0$ into
$w_y < -1$, which is slightly suggested by the observations. At the same time,
the total EOS in the attractor solution is $w_{tot} = -1$, the universe being
the de Sitter expansion in the late stage, and the cosmic big rip is naturally
avoided. These features are all independent of the interacting forms.

major planets produce chaotic behavior of asteroids on long timescales.
Dynamical chaos is the dominant loss mechanism for asteroids with diameters D >
10 km in the current asteroid belt. In a numerical analysis of the long term
evolution of test particles in the main asteroid belt region, we find that the
dynamical loss history of test particles from this region is well described
with a logarithmic decay law. In our simulations the loss rate function that is
established at t = 1 My persists with little deviation to at least t = 4 Gy.
Our study indicates that the asteroid belt region has experienced a significant
amount of depletion due to this dynamical erosion - having lost as much as ~50%
of the large asteroids - since 1 My after the establishment of the current
dynamical structure of the asteroid belt. Because the dynamical depletion of
asteroids from the main belt is approximately logarithmic, an equal amount of
depletion occurred in the time interval 10-200 My as in 0.2-4 Gy, roughly ~30%
of the current number of large asteroids in the main belt over each interval.
We find that asteroids escaping from the main belt due to dynamical chaos have
an Earth impact probability of ~0.3%. Our model suggests that the rate of
impacts from large asteroids has declined by a factor of 3 over the last 3 Gy,
and that the present-day impact flux of D > 10 km objects on the terrestrial
planets is roughly an order of magnitude less than estimates currently in use
in crater chronologies and impact hazard risk assessments.

to e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and
therefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in
astronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the
maximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys,
facilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science
specialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and
support of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics.
Astroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data
organization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies,
astronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization,
and astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy
now needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within
agency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate
training, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of
Astroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The
future of astronomy depends on it.

correlations obtained from the disease history of more than 30 million patients
in a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). We present evidence that the structure
of the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing
that (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already
have; (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is
different for patients of different genders and ethnicities; (3) patients
diagnosed with diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die
sooner than those affected by less connected diseases; and (4) diseases that
tend to be preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than
diseases that precede other illnesses, and are associated with higher degrees
of mortality. Our findings show that disease progression can be represented and
studied using network methods, offering the potential to enhance our

anti-de Sitter space and confining field theories in physical space-time,
provides a remarkable semiclassical model for hadron physics. Light-front
holography allows hadronic amplitudes in the AdS fifth dimension to be mapped
to frame-independent light-front wavefunctions of hadrons in physical
space-time, thus providing a relativistic description of hadrons at the
amplitude level. We identify the AdS coordinate $z$ with an invariant
light-front coordinate $\zeta$ which separates the dynamics of quark and gluon
binding from the kinematics of constituent spin and internal orbital angular
momentum. The result is a single-variable light-front Schr\""odinger equation
with a confining potential which determines the eigenspectrum and the
light-front wavefunctions of hadrons for general spin and orbital angular
momentum. The mapping of electromagnetic and gravitational form factors in AdS
space to their corresponding expressions in light-front theory confirms this
correspondence. Some novel features of QCD are discussed, including the
consequences of confinement for quark and gluon condensates. The distinction
between static structure functions, such as the probability distributions
computed from the square of the light-front wavefunctions, versus dynamical

the presence of numerous metastable minima (states) in the rugged free-energy
landscape of frustrated disordered magnets. This multiplicity of long-lived
states with lifetimes greater than $10^5 s$ makes the task to experimentally
determine which of them has the lowest free energy (and thus what thermodynamic
phase the sample is in) seem rather hopeless the more so as we do not know a
protocol (such as field-cooling or zero-field-cooling) leading to the

phenomenological model that signatures of the mean-field equilibrium phase
transitions in such highly nonequilibrium systems may be found in the evolution
of the hysteresis loop form. Thus the sequence of transitions from spin-glass
to mixed phase and to ferromagnetic one results in the changes from inclined
hysteresis loop to that with the developing vertical sides and to one with the
perfectly vertical sides. Such relation between loop form and the location of
global minimum may hold beyond the mean-field approximation and can be useful
in the real experiments and Monte-Carlo simulations of the problems involving
rugged potential landscape. Also the very existence of the quasi-static loops
in spin glass and mixed phases implies that the known disorder-smoothing of the
first-order transition can be always accompanied by the emergence of multiple
metastable states.

between sounds and objects (or concepts) of the perceived world. This mapping
is represented by a matrix and the linguistic interaction among individuals is
described by a random matrix model. There are two essential parameters in our
approach. The strength of the linguistic interaction $\beta$, which following
Chomsky's tradition, we consider as a genetically determined ability, and the
number $N$ of employed sounds (the lexicon size). Our model of linguistic
interaction is analytically studied using methods of statistical physics and
simulated by Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis reveals an intricate
relationship between the innate propensity for language acquisition $\beta$ and

CCD UBV(RI)_C photometry at the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory, M\'exico within
the framework of our open-cluster survey. The fundamental parameters of
interstellar reddening, distance, and age have been derived, and also the
metallicity for NGC 2192 (solar metallicity has been assumed for the other
two). By shifting the colours of Schmidt-Kaler in the (U-B, B-V) two-colour
diagram along the appropriate reddening vector, the interstellar reddenings
have been derived as E(B-V)=0.23+/-0.03 mag for Be 15, 1.31+/-0.05 for Be 80,
and 0.16+/-0.03 for NGC 2192. Evidence is shown for a variable interstellar
extinction across the cluster Be 80. For NGC 2192 a nicely consistent fit is
obtained for both the interstellar reddening and the metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.31)
using simultaneously the F-type and red-clump stars. By fitting isochrones to
the observed sequences of these three clusters in various colour-magnitude
diagrams of different colour indices, (B-V, V-I, or V-R) the averages of
distance moduli and heliocentric distances ((V-M_V)_o (mag); d(pc)) are the
following: (10.74+/-0.01; 1202) for Be 15, (10.75+/-0.01; 1413) for Be 80, and
(12.7+/-0.01; 3467) for NGC 2192, and the averages of the inferred best ages
(log(age); age (Gyr)) are (8.6+/-0.05; 0.4) for Be 80, and (9.15+/-0.05; 1.4)
for NGC 2192; for Be 15 there are two distinct possibilities for the age fit,
depending on the membership of three brighter stars, (9.35 or 9.95+/-0.05; 2.2
or 8.9). The need for spectroscopic observations in Be 15 is emphasized to
select between alternate reddening and age solutions, and for deeper UBV
observations in Be 80 to study in greater detail the variable interstellar, or
intracluster, reddening across this cluster.

that it is on the large scales. Our solutions first confirm some analytical
results obtained on a two-dimensional model by Ogilvie (2005). We also note
that as the frequency of the forcing varies, the dissipation varies drastically
if the Ekman number E is low (as is usually the case). We then investigate the
three-dimensional case and compare the results to the foregoing model. These
solutions show, like their 2D counterpart, a spiky dissipation curve when the
frequency of the forcing is varied; they also display small frequency intervals
where the viscous dissipation is independent of viscosity. However, we show
that the response of the fluid in these frequency intervals is crucially
dominated by the shear layer that is emitted at the critical latitude on the
inner sphere. The asymptotic regime is reached when an attractor has been
excited by this shear layer. This property is not shared by the two-dimensional
model. Finally, resonances of the three-dimensional model correspond to some
selected least-damped eigenmodes. Unlike their two-dimensional counter parts
these modes are not associated with simple attractors; instead, they show up in
frequency intervals with a weakly contracting web of characteristics. Besides,
we show that the inner core is negligible when its relative radius is less than
the critical value 0.4E^{1/5}. For these spherical shells, the full sphere
solutions give a good approximation of the flows (abridged abstract).

results to constrain the history of star formation within the host complex W51.
A combination of near-IR spectroscopy and non-LTE model atmosphere analysis was
used to derive the physical properties of [OMN2000] LS1 and a combination of
theoretical evolutionary calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to apply
limits on the star formation history of W51. The spectrum of [OMN2000] LS1 is
consistent with that of a P Cygni supergiant, but with a temperature of
13.2-13.7kK and log(L/L_sun)<5.75, it is significantly cooler, less luminous,
and massive than proposed by previous authors. The presence of such a star
within W51 shows that star formation has been underway for at least 3Myr, while
the formation of massive O stars is still on going. We find no evidence of
internally triggered, sequential star formation within W51, and favour the
suggestion that star formation has proceeded at multiple indepedent sites
within the GMC. [ABRIDGED]

Barnes et al (2004) and 35 field galaxies of Spano et al. (2008). The central
halo surface density is found to be constant with respect to the total absolute

that the halo density is independent to galaxy type and environment. We have
found that core-like density profiles fit better the rotation curves than
cuspy-like ones. No major differences have been found between field, cluster

synthesis population code that incorporates a new treatment of the TP--AGB
phase (CB07). Our primary aim is to investigate the impact of the AGB phase in
the stellar masses of the LBGs, and compare our new results with previous
stellar mass estimates. Based on the new CB07 code we find that the stellar
masses of LBGs are smaller on average by a factor of ~1.4 compared to previous
estimates. LBGs with 8um and/or 24um detections show higher masses (M~10^11 Mo)
than LBGs faint in the IRAC bands (M~10^9 Mo). The ages of these massive LBGs
are considerably higher than the rest of the population, indicating that they
have been star-forming for at least ~1 Gyr. We also show how the addition of
the IRAC bands, improves the accuracy of the estimated stellar masses and
reduced the scatter on the derived M/L ratios. In particular, we present a
tight correlation between the 8um IRAC band (rest-frame K for galaxies at z~3)
and the stellar mass. We calculate the number density of massive (M > 10^11 Mo)
LBGs and find it to be $\Phi$= (1.12 $\pm$ 0.4) x 10^(-5) Mpc^(-3), ~1.5 times
lower than that found by previous studies. Finally, based on UV-corrected SFRs

spontaneously broken at the matrix size $N$ infinite. The models are obtained
by dimensional reduction of matrix-valued SUSY quantum mechanics. The potential
of the models is slowly varying, and the large-$N$ limit is taken with the
slowly varying limit.
  First, we explain our formalism, introducing an external field to detect
spontaneous SUSY breaking, analogously to ordinary (bosonic) symmetry breaking.
It is observed that SUSY is possibly broken even in systems in less than
one-dimension, for example, discretized quantum mechanics with a finite number
of discretized time steps. Then, we consider spontaneous SUSY breaking in the
SUSY matrix models with slowly varying potential, where the external field is
turned off after the large-$N$ and slowly varying limit, analogously to the
thermodynamic limit in statistical systems. On the other hand, without taking
the slowly varying limit, in the SUSY matrix model with a double-well potential
whose SUSY is broken due to instantons for finite $N$, a number of
supersymmetric behavior is explicitly seen at large $N$. It convinces us that
the instanton effect disappears and the SUSY gets restored in the large-$N$
limit.

galaxies along the line-of-sight, within larger virialized groups or even
longer filamentary structures? The nature of CGs is re-appraised using the z=0
outputs of three galaxy formation models, applied to the dissipationless
Millennium Simulation. The same selection criteria are applied to mock galaxy
catalogs from these models as have been applied by Hickson and co-workers in
redshift space. We find 20 times as many mock CGs as the `HCGs' found by
Hickson within a distance corresponding to 9000 km/s. This very low (5%) HCG
completeness is caused by Hickson missing groups that were either faint, near
the surface brightness threshold, of small angular size, or with a dominant
brightest galaxy. We find that most velocity-filtered CGs are physically dense,
regardless of the precise threshold used in 3D group size and line-of-sight
elongation, and of the galaxy formation model used. This result also holds for
mock CGs with the same selection biases as was found for the HCGs.

containing nilpotent infinitesimals. The construction takes inspiration from
Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis (SIA), but provides a powerful theory of actual
infinitesimals without any need of a background in mathematical logic. In
particular, on the contrary with respect to SIA, which admits models only in
intuitionistic logic, the theory of Fermat reals is consistent with classical
logic. We face the problem to decide if the product of powers of nilpotent
infinitesimals is zero or not, the identity principle for polynomials, the
definition and properties of the total order relation. The construction is
highly constructive, and every Fermat real admits a clear and order preserving
geometrical representation. Using nilpotent infinitesimals, every smooth
functions becomes a polynomial because in Taylor's formulas the rest is now
zero. Finally, we present several applications to informal classical

The central kiloparsec of many local Luminous Infra-red Galaxies are
known to host intense bursts of massive star formation, leading to numerous
explosions of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). However, the dust-enshrouded
regions where those supernovae explode hamper their detection at optical and
near-infrared wavelengths. Aims. We investigate the nuclear region of the
starbust galaxy IC 694 (=Arp 299-A) at radio wavelengths, aimed at discovering
recently exploded CCSNe, as well as to determine their rate of explosion, which
carries crucial information on star formation rates, the initial mass function
and starburst scenarios at work. Methods. We use the electronic European VLBI
Network to image with milliarcsecond resolution the 5.0 GHz compact radio
emission of the innermost nuclear region of IC 694. Results. Our observations
reveal the presence of a rich cluster of 26 compact radio emitting sources in
the central 150 pc of the nuclear starburst in IC 694. The large brightness
temperatures observed for the compact sources indicate a non-thermal origin for
the observed radio emission, implying that most, if not all, of those sources
are young radio supernovae (RSNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs). We find
evidence for at least three relatively young, slowly-evolving, long-lasting
RSNe (A0, A12, and A15) which appear to display unusual properties; suggesting
that the conditions in the local circumstellar medium (CSM) play a significant
role in determining the radio behaviour of expanding SNe. Their radio
luminosities are typical of normal RSNe, which result from the explosion of
Type IIP/b and Type IIL SNe. All these results yield support for a recent (less
than 10-15 Myr) instantaneous starburst in the innermost regions of IC 694.

multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink in the presence of
imperfections in the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). The
base station (BS) is equipped with multiple transmit antennas, and each user
terminal is equipped with one or more receive antennas. The BS employs
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) for inter-user interference
pre-cancellation at the transmitter. We consider robust transceiver designs
that jointly optimize the transmit THP filters and receive filter for two
models of CSIT errors. The first model is a stochastic error (SE) model, where
the CSIT error is Gaussian-distributed. This model is applicable when the CSIT
error is dominated by channel estimation error. In this case, the proposed
robust transceiver design seeks to minimize a stochastic function of the sum
mean square error (SMSE) under a constraint on the total BS transmit power. We
propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. The other model we
consider is a norm-bounded error (NBE) model, where the CSIT error can be
specified by an uncertainty set. This model is applicable when the CSIT error
is dominated by quantization errors. In this case, we consider a worst-case
design. For this model, we consider robust i) minimum SMSE, ii)
MSE-constrained, and iii) MSE-balancing transceiver designs. We propose
iterative algorithms to solve these problems, wherein each iteration involves a
pair of semi-definite programs (SDP). Further, we consider an extension of the
proposed algorithm to the case with per-antenna power constraints.

which a new strongly-coupled sector is responsible for the breaking of the EW
symmetry. In this paper we investigate their experimental signature at the LHC,
focusing on the particularly clean channel of same-sign dileptons.
  We show that, thank to a strong interaction with the top quark which allows
them to be singly produced at a sizable rate, the top partners will be
discovered at the LHC if their mass is below 1.5 TeV, higher masses being
possible in particularly favorable (but plausible) situations. Being the
partners expected to be lighter in both the Higgsless and Composite-Higgs
scenarios, the one of same-sign dileptons is found to be a very promising
channel in which these models could be tested.
  We also discuss several experimental signatures which would allow, after the
discovery of the excess, to uniquely attribute it to the top partners
production and to measure the relevant physical parameters, i.e. the top
partners masses and couplings. We believe that our results constitute a valid
starting point for a more detailed experimental study.

eigenstate ($K^0_S\pi^0$, $K^0_S\phi$, $K^0_S\omega$) or a non-CP state
($K^-\pi^+$). We also analyze $D$ meson decays into $K^+\pi^-$ from a
Cabibbo-favored $\bar{D}^0$ decay or doubly suppressed $D^0$ decay (""ADS""
analysis). We measure observables that are sensitive to the CKM angle $\gamma$:
the partial-rate charge asymmetries ${\cal A}_{CP\pm}$, the ratios ${\cal
R}_{CP\pm}$ of the B-decay branching fractions in $CP\pm$ and non-CP decay, the
ratio ${\cal R}_{ADS}$ of the charge-averaged branching fractions, and the
charge asymmetry ${\cal A}_{ADS}$ of the ADS decays: ${\cal A}_{CP+}=
0.09\pm0.13 \pm 0.06$, ${\cal A}_{CP-}=-0.23\pm 0.21\pm 0.07$, ${\cal R}_{CP+}
=2.17 \pm 0.35 \pm 0.09$,${\cal R}_{CP-} =1.03\pm 0.27\pm 0.13$, ${\cal
R}_{ADS}=0.066\pm0.031\pm0.010$, and ${\cal A}_{ADS}=-0.34\pm0.43\pm 0.16$,
where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.
Combining all the measurements and using a frequentist approach yields the
magnitude of the ratio between the Cabibbo-suppressed and favored amplitudes,
$r_B$ = 0.31 with a one (two) sigma confidence level interval of [0.24, 0.38]
([0.17, 0.43]). The value $r_B=0$ is excluded at the 3.3 sigma level. A similar
analysis excludes values of $\gamma$ in the intervals $[0, 7]^{\circ}, [55,
111]^{\circ}$, and $[175, 180]^{\circ}$ ([85, 99]$^{\circ}$) at the one (two)
sigma confidence level.

solar interior, through the photosphere and into the corona. Many previous
theoretical studies of flux emergence use a twisted cylindrical tube in the
solar interior as the initial condition. Important insights can be gained from
this model, however, it does have shortcomings. The axis of the tube never
fully emerges as dense plasma becomes trapped in magnetic dips and restrains
its ascent. Also, since the entire tube is buoyant, the main photospheric
footpoints (sunspots) continually drift apart. These problems make it difficult
to produce a convincing sunspot pair. We aim to address these problems by
considering a different initial condition, namely a toroidal flux tube. We
perform numerical experiments and solve the 3D MHD equations. The dynamics are
investigated through a range of initial field strengths and twists. The
experiments demonstrate that the emergence of toroidal flux tubes is highly
dynamic and exhibits a rich variety of behaviour. In answer to the aims,
however, if the initial field strength is strong enough, the axis of the tube
can fully emerge. Also, the sunspot pair does not continually drift apart.
Instead, its maximum separation is the diameter of the original toroidal tube.

principal spectral features. In the early stages of the outburst, the optically
thick disc dominates the optical and the line components show clear orbital
radial velocity excursions. In the course of several weeks, optically thin
regions become more prominent as strong emission lines replace the broad disc
absorption.
  Post-outburst spectroscopy covering the I-band illustrates the advantages of
CaII relative to the commonly used Balmer lines when attempting to constrain
binary parameters. Due to the lower ionisation energy combined with smaller
thermal and shear broadening of these lines, a sharp emission component is seen
to be moving in between the accretion disc peaks in the CaII line. No such
component is visible in the Balmer lines. We interpret this as an emission
component originating on the hitherto unseen mass donor star.
  While our conservative dynamical limits place a hard upper limit on the
binary mass ratio of q<0.23, we favour a significantly lower value near q~0.06.
Pulsation modeling suggests a WD mass ~1 M_sun. This, paired with a low mass
donor, near the empirical sequence of an evolved CV close to the period bounce,
appears to be consistent with all the observational constraints to date.

expanded as a Fourier-Legendre series of Legendre polynomials Pl(cos(theta) =

(i.e. Moshinsky's and Hooke's atoms), for which exact wavefunctions are known,
and to the helium atom, using a near-exact wavefunction. In the present
approach, generic closed form expressions are derived for the series
coefficients of rho(r, r'). The series expansions are shown to converge rapidly
in each case, with respect to both the electron number and the kinetic energy.
In practice, a two-term expansion accounts for most of the correlation effects,
so that the correlated density-matrices of the atoms at issue are essentially a
linear functions of P1(cos(theta)) = cos(theta). For example, in the case of
the Hooke's atom: a two-term expansion takes in 99.9 % of the electrons and
99.6 % of the kinetic energy. The correlated density-matrices obtained are
finally compared to their determinantal counterparts, using a simplified
representation of the density-matrix rho(r, r'), suggested by the Legendre
expansion. Interestingly, two-particle correlation is shown to impact the
angular delocalization of each electron, in the one-particle space spanned by
the r and r' variables.

provide three characterizations of the singular components of ${\mathcal F}_u$

not a given mathematical model can admit more than one steady state. As
parameter values are often unknown or subject to a very high uncertainty, one
is often interested in the question, whether or not a given mathematical model
can, for some conceivable parameter vector, exhibit multistationarity at all. A
partial answer to this question is given in Feinberg's deficiency one
algorithm. This algorithm can decide about multistationarity by analyzing
systems of linear inequalities that are independent of parameter values.
However, the deficiency one algorithm is limited to what its author calls
regular deficiency one networks. Many realistic networks have a deficiency
higher than one, thus the algorithm cannot be applied directly. In a previous
publication it was suggested to analyze certain well defined subnetworks that
are guaranteed to be of deficiency one. Realistic reaction networks, however,
often lead to subnetworks that are irregular, especially if metabolic networks
are considered. Here the special structure of the subnetworks is used to derive
conditions for multistationarity. These conditions are independent of the
regularity conditions required by the deficiency one algorithm. Thus, in
particular, these conditions are applicable to irregular subnetworks.

a coevolutionary rule is introduced that molds the random topology of the
interaction network in two ways. First, existing links are deleted whenever a
player adopts a new strategy or its degree exceeds a threshold value, and
second, new links are added randomly after a given number of game iterations.
These coevolutionary processes correspond to the generic formation of new and
deletion of existing links that, especially in human societies, appear
frequently as a consequence of ongoing socialization, change of lifestyle or
death. Due to the counteraction of deletions and additions of links the initial
heterogeneity of the interaction network is qualitatively preserved, and thus
cannot be held responsible for the observed promotion of cooperation. Indeed,
the coevolutionary rule evokes the spontaneous emergence of a powerful
multilevel selection mechanism, which despite of the sustained random topology
of the evolving network, maintains cooperation across the whole span of
defection temptation values.

spatial distribution of the annihilation emission observed in our Galaxy
reflects the spatial distribution of positron sources and, therefore, makes it
possible to place constraints on the origin of positrons. We review the
different processes that are likely to affect the transport of positrons in the
ISM. These processes fall into three broad categories: scattering off
magnetohydrodynamic waves, collisions with particles of the interstellar gas
and advection with large-scale fluid motions. We assess the efficiency of each
process and describe its impact on the propagation of positrons. We also
develop a model of positron propagation, based on Monte-Carlo simulations,
which enable us to estimate the distances traveled by positrons in the
different phases of the ISM. We find that low-energy (< 10 MeV) positrons
generally have negligible interactions with magnetohydrodynamic waves, insofar
as these waves are heavily damped. Positron propagation is mainly controlled by
collisions with gas particles. Under these circumstances, positrons can travel
huge distances (up to 30 kpc/n_H for 1 MeV positrons) along magnetic field
lines before annihilating.
