from Oesch et al. 2009 and Bouwens et al. 2009 detected in ultra-deep
near-infrared imaging of the Hubble Ultra Deep field (HUDF) by the HUDF09
program. With an average intrinsic size of 0.7+-0.3 kpc these galaxies are
found to be extremely compact having an average observed surface brightness of
mu_J ~= 26 mag arcsec^(-2), and only two out of the full sample of 16 z~7
galaxies show extended features with resolved double cores. By comparison to
lower redshift LBGs it is found that only little size evolution takes place
from z~7 to z~6, while galaxies between z~4-5 show more extended wings in their
apparent profiles. The average size scales as (1+z)^(-m) with m=1.12+-0.17 for
galaxies with luminosities in the range (0.3-1)L*_{z=3} and with m=1.32+-0.52
for (0.12-0.3)L*_{z=3}, consistent with galaxies having constant comoving
sizes. The peak of the size distribution changes only slowly from z~7 to z~4.
However, a tail of larger galaxies (>~ 1.2 kpc) is gradually built up towards
later cosmic times, possibly via hierarchical build-up or via enhanced
accretion of cold gas. Additionally, the average star-formation surface density
of LBGs with luminosities (0.3-1)L*_{z=3} is nearly constant at Sigma_{SFR}=1.9
Msun/yr/kpc^2 over the entire redshift range z~4-7 suggesting similar
star-formation efficiencies at these early epochs. The above evolutionary
trends seem to hold out to z~8 though the sample is still small and possibly
incomplete.

correlated adiabatic and cold dark matter isocurvature components. We perform
nested sampling with flat and, for the first time, curved spatial geometries of
the Universe, using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies, the Union supernovae (SN) sample and a combined measurement of
the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The CMB alone favors a 3% (positively
correlated) isocurvature contribution in both the flat and curved cases. The
non-adiabatic contribution to the observed CMB temperature variance is 0 <
alpha_T < 7% at 98% CL in the curved case. In the flat case, combining the CMB
with SN data artificially biases the result towards the pure adiabatic LCDM
concordance model, whereas in the curved case the favored level of
non-adiabaticity stays at 3% level with all combinations of data. However, the
ratio of Bayes factors, or Delta ln(evidence), is more than 5 points in favor
of the flat adiabatic LCDM model, which suggests that the inclusion of the 5
extra parameters of the curved isocurvature model is not supported by the
current data. The results are very sensitive to the second and third acoustic
peak regions in the CMB temperature angular power: therefore a careful
calibration of these data will be required before drawing decisive conclusions
on the nature of primordial perturbations. Finally, we point out that the odds
for the flat non-adiabatic model are 1:3 compared to the curved adiabatic
model. This may suggest that it is not much less motivated to extend the
concordance model with 4 isocurvature degrees of freedom than it is to study
the spatially curved adiabatic model.

Mpc, we evaluate the consistency between star formation rates (SFRs) inferred
from the far ultraviolet (FUV) non-ionizing continuum and H-alpha nebular
emission, assuming standard conversion recipes in which the SFR scales linearly
with luminosity at a given wavelength. Our analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders
of magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of ~0.0001 M_sun/yr.
The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc H-alpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey
(11HUGS), which has obtained H-alpha fluxes from ground-based narrowband
imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies
(SFR~1 M_sun/yr), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown
that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than H-alpha SFRs before accounting for internal
dust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two
tracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered
at the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf
galaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined,
H-alpha tends to increasingly under-predict the SFR relative to the FUV.
Although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time
this effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR~<0.1
M_sun/yr. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to
account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for an
IMF which is deficient in high mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness
galaxies, and we also consider this scenario.

bounded variance or a bounded kurtosis. It turns out that these minimax
deviations are of the same order as the deviations of the empirical mean
estimator of a Gaussian distribution. Nevertheless, the empirical mean itself
performs poorly at high confidence levels for the worst distribution with a

(nearly) minimax deviations in these broad class of distributions, it is
necessary to use some more robust estimator, and we describe an iterated
truncation scheme whose deviations are close to minimax. In order to calibrate
the truncation and obtain explicit confidence intervals, it is necessary to
dispose of a prior bound either on the variance or the kurtosis. When a prior
bound on the kurtosis is available, we obtain as a by-product a new variance
estimator with good large deviation properties. When no prior bound is

templates are fit to identified counterparts, and the sample is found to
comprise IR-luminous galaxies at 1<z<3 predominantly powered by star formation.
The first spectrum of a 350-micron-selected galaxy provides an additional
confirmation, showing prominent dust grain features typically associated with
star-forming galaxies.
  Compared to submillimeter galaxies selected at 850 and 1100 microns, galaxies
selected at 350 microns have a similar range of far-infrared color
temperatures. However, no 350-micron-selected sources are reliably detected at
850 or 1100 microns. Galaxies in our sample with redshifts 1<z<2 show a tight
correlation between the far- and mid-infrared flux densities, but galaxies at
higher redshifts show a large dispersion in their mid- to far-infrared colors.
  The 350-micron flux densities (15<S(350)<40 mJy) place these objects near the
Herschel/SPIRE 350-micron confusion threshold, with the lower limit on the star
formation rate density suggesting the bulk of the 350-micron contribution will
come from less luminous infrared sources and normal galaxies.

where dwarfs around the turn-off and stars at the base of the RGB dominate the
integrated light at all ages. The near-infrared spectral range is especially
interesting since in the presence of an intermediate-age population, AGB stars
are the main contributors. In this letter, we measure the near-infrared indices
NaI and D$_{\rm CO}$ for a sample of 12 early-type galaxies in low density
environments and compare them with the Fornax galaxy sample presented by Silva
et al. (2008). The analysis of these indices in combination with Lick/IDS
indices in the optical range reveals i) the NaI index is a metallicity
indicator as good as C4668 in the optical range, and ii) D$_{\rm CO}$ is a
tracer of intermediate-age stellar populations. We find that low-mass galaxies
in low density environments show higher NaI and D$_{\rm CO}$ than those located
in Fornax cluster, which points towards a late stage of star formation for the
galaxies in less dense environments, in agreement with results from other
studies using independent methods.

Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data by applying a recently introduced
angular-planar statistics both to full-sky and to masked temperature maps,
including in our analysis the effect of the residual foreground contamination
and systematics in the foreground removing process as sources of error. We
confirm earlier findings that full-sky maps exhibit anomalies at the planar
($l$) and angular ($\ell$) scales $(l,\ell)=(2,5),(4,7),$ and $(6,8)$, which
seem to be due to unremoved foregrounds since this features are present in the
full-sky map but not in the masked maps. On the other hand, our test detects
slightly anomalous results at the scales $(l,\ell)=(10,8)$ and $(2,9)$ in the
masked maps but not in the full-sky one, indicating that the foreground
cleaning procedure (used to generate the full-sky map) could not only be
creating false anomalies but also hiding existing ones. We also find a
significant trace of an anomaly in the full-sky map at the scale
$(l,\ell)=(10,5)$, which is still present when we consider galactic cuts of
18.3% and 28.4%. As regards the quadrupole ($\ell=2$), we find a coherent
over-modulation over the whole celestial sphere, for all full-sky and cut-sky
maps. Overall, our results seem to indicate that current CMB maps derived from
WMAP data do not show significant signs of anisotropies, as measured by our
angular-planar estimator. However, we have detected a curious coherence of
planar modulations at angular scales of the order of the galaxy's plane, which
may be an indication of residual contaminations in the full- and cut-sky maps.

localized, many of these naturally admit spectral representations, or they may
need to be extracted from data collected globally, e.g. by satellites that
circumnavigate the Earth. Wavelets are often used to study such nonstationary
processes. On the sphere, however, many of the known constructions are somewhat
limited. And in particular, the notion of `dilation' is hard to reconcile with
the concept of a geological region with fixed boundaries being responsible for
generating the signals to be analyzed. Here, we build on our previous work on
localized spherical analysis using an approach that is firmly rooted in
spherical harmonics. We construct, by quadratic optimization, a set of
bandlimited functions that have the majority of their energy concentrated in an
arbitrary subdomain of the unit sphere. The `spherical Slepian basis' that
results provides a convenient way for the analysis and representation of
geophysical signals, as we show by example. We highlight the connections to

is an ideal one for investigation by an undergraduate physics major because the
entire chain of reasoning from models to data analysis is well within the

behind walls in real-time. The method takes advantage of the motion-induced
variance of received signal strength measurements made in a wireless

strength on a wireless link is largely dependent on the power contained in
multipath components that travel through space containing moving objects. A
statistical model relating variance to spatial locations of movement is
presented and used as a framework for the estimation of a motion image. From
the motion image, the Kalman filter is applied to recursively track the

the symmetry imposes that if an observer at infinity sees a black hole of mass

effort has been spent by the machine learning community to develop better
understanding and improve the quality of classifiers exploiting unlabeled data.
Following the manifold regularization approach, Laplacian Support Vector
Machines (LapSVMs) have shown the state of the art performance in
semi--supervised classification. In this paper we present two strategies to
solve the primal LapSVM problem, in order to overcome some issues of the
original dual formulation. Whereas training a LapSVM in the dual requires two
steps, using the primal form allows us to collapse training to a single step.
Moreover, the computational complexity of the training algorithm is reduced
from O(n^3) to O(n^2) using preconditioned conjugate gradient, where n is the
combined number of labeled and unlabeled examples. We speed up training by
using an early stopping strategy based on the prediction on unlabeled data or,
if available, on labeled validation examples. This allows the algorithm to
quickly compute approximate solutions with roughly the same classification
accuracy as the optimal ones, considerably reducing the training time. Due to
its simplicity, training LapSVM in the primal can be the starting point for
additional enhancements of the original LapSVM formulation, such as those for
dealing with large datasets. We present an extensive experimental evaluation on
real world data showing the benefits of the proposed approach.

channel (CRC), when there is perfect and no channel state information at the
receivers and the transmitter(s) (CSIR and CSIT), respectively. For the K-user
MIMO BC, the exact characterization of the DoF region is obtained, which shows
that a simple time-division-based transmission scheme is DoF-region optimal.
Using the techniques developed for the MIMO BC, the corresponding problems for
the two-user MIMO IC and the CRC are addressed. For both of these channels,
inner and outer bounds to the DoF region are obtained and are seen to coincide
for a vast majority of the relative numbers of antennas at the four terminals,
thereby characterizing DoF regions for all but a few cases. Finally, the DoF
regions of the $K$-user MIMO IC, the CRC, and X networks are derived for
certain classes of these networks, including the one where all transmitters
have an equal number of antennas and so do all receivers. The results of this
paper are derived for distributions of fading channel matrices and additive
noises that are more general than those considered in other simultaneous
related works. The DoF regions with and without CSIT are compared and
conditions on the relative numbers of antennas at the terminals under which a
lack of CSIT does, or does not, result in the loss of DoF are identified,
thereby providing, on the one hand, simple and robust communication schemes
that don't require CSIT but have the same DoF performance as their previously
found CSIT counterparts, and on the other hand, identifying situations where
CSI feedback to transmitters would provide gains that are significant enough
that even the DoF performance could be improved.

formation (SF) models on the cosmic SF history using cosmological smoothed
particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations based on the cold dark matter (CDM)
model. We vary the cosmological parameters within 1-sigma error from the WMAP
best-fit parameters, and find that such changes in cosmological parameters
mostly affect the amplitude of the cosmic SF history. At high redshift
(hereafter high-z), the star formation rate (SFR) is sensitive to the
cosmological parameters that control the small-scale power of the primordial
power spectrum, while the cosmic matter content becomes important at lower
redshifts. We also test two new SF models: 1) the `Pressure' model based on the
work by Schaye & Dalla Vecchia (2008), and 2) the `Blitz' model that takes the
effect of molecular hydrogen formation into account, based on the work by Blitz
& Rosolowsky (2006). Compared to the previous conventional SF model, the
Pressure model reduces the SFR in low-density regions and shows better
agreement with the observations of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. This model also
suppresses the early star formation and shifts the peak of the cosmic SF
history toward lower redshift, more consistently with the recent observational
estimates of cosmic SFR density. The simulations with the new SF model also
predict lower global stellar mass densities at high-z, larger populations of
low-mass galaxies and a higher gas fraction in high-z galaxies. Our results
suggest that there is room left in the model uncertainties to reconcile the
discrepancy that was found between the theory and observations of cosmic SF
history and stellar mass density. Nevertheless, our simulations still predict
higher stellar mass densities than most of the observational estimates.

superficially looks similar to the simple constant velocity advection equation.
In fact, it is the same as an advection equation if there are no local extrema
in the computational domain or at the boundary. However, in general when there
are local extrema in the computational domain it is a non-trivial nonlinear
equation. The standard upwind time evolution with a CFL-limited time step
results in spurious oscillations at the grid scale. These oscillations, which
originate at the extrema, propagate throughout the computational domain and are
undamped even at late times. These oscillations arise because of unphysically
large fluxes leaving (entering) the maxima (minima) with the standard
CFL-limited explicit methods. Regularization of the equation shows that it is
diffusive at the extrema; because of this, an explicit method for the
regularized equation with $\Delta t \propto \Delta x^2$ behaves fine. We show
that the implicit methods show stable and converging results with $\Delta t
\propto \Delta x$; however, surprisingly, even implicit methods are not stable
with large enough timesteps. In addition to these subtleties in the numerical
implementation, the solutions to the streaming equation are quite novel:
non-differentiable solutions emerge from initially smooth profiles; the
solutions show transport over large length scales, e.g., in form of tails. The
fluid model for cosmic rays interacting with a thermal plasma (valid at space
scales much larger than the cosmic ray Larmor radius) is similar to the
equation for streaming of a quantity down its gradient, so our method will find
applications in fluid modeling of cosmic rays.

charge-transport in a nanoscale diffusive
superconductor$\mid$ferromagnet$\mid$superconductor junction when the
magnetization texture is non-uniform. Specifically, we incorporate the presence
of a Bloch/Neel domain walls and conical ferromagnetism, including spin-active
interfaces. The superconducting leads are assumed to be of s-wave type. We
investigate how the 0-$\pi$ transition is influenced by the inhomogeneous
magnetization texture and focus on the particular case where the charge-current
vanishes while the spin-current is non-zero. In the case of a Bloch/Neel
domain-wall, the spin-current can be seen only for one component of the spin
polarization, whereas in the case of conical ferromagnetism the spin-current
has the three components. We explain all of these results in terms of the
interplay between the triplet anomalous Green's function induced in the
ferromagnetic region and the local direction of the magnetization vector in the
ferromagnet. Interestingly, we find that the spin-current exhibits
discontinuous jumps at the 0--$\pi$ transition points of the critical
charge-current. We explain this result in terms of the different symmetry
obeyed by the current-phase relation when comparing the charge- and
spin-current. Specifically, we find that whereas the charge-current obeys the
well-known relation $I_c(\phi) = -I_c(2\pi-\phi)$, the spin-current satisfies
$I_s(\phi) = I_s(2\pi-\phi)$, where $\phi$ is the superconducting phase
difference.

Sitter gauge theory to construct new solutions to the first order field
equations. The new solutions are constructed by performing large $Spin(4,1)$
gauge transformations on the ordinary de Sitter solution and extracting first
the tetrad, then the induced metric. The class of metrics so obtained is an
infinite class labelled by an integer, $q$. Each solution satisfies the local
field equations defining constant positive curvature, and is therefore locally
isometric to de Sitter space wherever the metric is non-degenerate. The
degeneracy structure of the tetrad and metric reflects the topological
differences among the solutions with different $q$. By topological arguments we
show that the solutions are physically distinct with respect to the symmetries
of Einstein-Cartan theory. Ultimately, the existence of solutions of this type
may be a distinguishing characteristic of gravity as a metric theory versus
gravity as a gauge theory.

far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high
reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust
emission at the same time. For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code
Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston
(or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on
a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale & Helou dust
emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on
the input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared
to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was
tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of
the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting
expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model
grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric
data on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and
160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective
age of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity
absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. A study of the mutual
relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star
formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a
significant drop in this activity at about 10^11 M_sol towards higher total

mix with the Bino and extend the MSSM neutralino sector. This leads to novel
signatures at the LHC. The lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle (LOSP) can
decay to any one of these photini. In turn, photini may transition into each
other, leading to high lepton and jet multiplicities. Both the LOSP decays and
inter-photini transitions can lead to displaced vertices. When the interphotini
decays happen outside the detector, the cascades can result in different
photini escaping the detector leading to multiple reconstructed masses for the

out-of-time to photini, with the possibility that the produced final photini

deconvolution techniques both reveal X-ray enhancements that closely match the
substructures seen in the Hubble Space Telescope [OIII] image and prominent

[OIII] to soft X-ray ratio ~10, despite the distance of the clouds from the
nucleus. This ratio is consistent with the values observed in NLRs of some
Seyfert 2 galaxies, which indicates a uniform ionization parameter even at
large radii and a density decreasing as $r^{-2}$ as expected for a nuclear wind
scenario. The [OIII]/X-ray ratios at the location of radio knots show an excess
of X-ray emission, suggesting shock heating in addition to photoionization. We
examine various mechanisms for the X-ray emission and find that, in contrast to
jet-related X-ray emission in more powerful AGN, the observed jet parameters in
NGC 4151 are inconsistent with synchrotron emission, synchrotron self-Compton,
inverse Compton of CMB photons or galaxy optical light. Instead, our results
favor thermal emission from the interaction between radio outflow and NLR gas
clouds as the origin for the X-ray emission associated with the jet. This
supports previous claims that frequent jet-ISM interaction may explain why jets
in Seyfert galaxies appear small, slow, and thermally dominated, distinct from
those kpc scale jets in the radio galaxies.

wavefront of a function from spectral data. The wavefront of f(x) is the set of
points $(x,k) \in R^N \times (S^{N-1} / \{\pm 1\})$ which encode both the
location of the singular points of a function and the orientation of the
singularities. (Here $S^{N-1}$ denotes the unit sphere in N dimensions.) More
precisely, k is the direction of the normal line to the curve or surface of

the wavefront onto its x-component. In one dimension, the wavefront is a subset
of R^1 and coincides with the singular support. In higher dimensions, geometry
comes into play and they are distinct. We discuss the advantages of wavefront
reconstruction and indicate how it can be used for segmentation in magnetic

volume suppression of the gauge coupling constants. A similar suppression
occurs for the case of UV localization. Thus it seems that the Standard Model

and dimensionful parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM), incorporating 1-loop thresholds. The inclusion of these thresholds
necessarily results in splitting between dimensionless couplings which are
equal at the tree level. Assuming that the SUSY-breaking mechanism does not
introduce new intergenerational couplings, we present the most general form for
high-scale, soft-SUSY-breaking (SSB) parameters. With this as our boundary
condition, we consider illustrative examples of numerical solutions to the
RGEs. In a supersymmetric grand unified theory with the scale of SUSY scalars
split from that of gauginos and higgsinos, we find that the gaugino mass
unification relation may be violated to the order of 10%. Further, we consider
the rate for the flavor violating decay of the lightest stop to charm plus
neutralino. We find that using the complete RGE solution as opposed to the
commonly used `single-step' integration of the RGEs can qualitatively change
the picture of event-topologies from top-squark pair production, or from gluino
production if gluino to stop plus top is the dominant gluino decay mode.

  5, 2009",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Minimizing the rank of a matrix subject to affine constraints is a
fundamental problem with many important applications in machine learning and
statistics. In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular
Value Projection) for rank minimization with affine constraints (ARMP) and show
that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy
the ""restricted isometry property"" and show robustness of our method to noise.
Our results improve upon a recent breakthrough by Recht, Fazel and Parillo
(RFP07) and Lee and Bresler (LB09) in three significant ways:
  1) our method (SVP) is significantly simpler to analyze and easier to
implement,
  2) we give recovery guarantees under strictly weaker isometry assumptions
  3) we give geometric convergence guarantees for SVP even in presense of noise
and, as demonstrated empirically, SVP is significantly faster on real-world and
synthetic problems.
  In addition, we address the practically important problem of low-rank matrix
completion (MCP), which can be seen as a special case of ARMP. We empirically
demonstrate that our algorithm recovers low-rank incoherent matrices from an
almost optimal number of uniformly sampled entries. We make partial progress
towards proving exact recovery and provide some intuition for the strong
performance of SVP applied to matrix completion by showing a more restricted
isometry property. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, such as those of
\cite{RFP07,CR08,CT09,CCS08,KOM09,LB09}, for ARMP and the matrix-completion
problem by an order of magnitude and is also significantly more robust to
noise.

by clinicians to assess the condition of the gland during prostate cancer
screening. As an alternative to palpation, an increasing number of methods for
estimation of the above-mentioned quantities are based on using imagery data of
prostate. The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need
for automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried
out with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal
ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a
standard clinical practice due to the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this
imaging modality. Unfortunately, the segmentation of TRUS images is still
hampered by relatively low contrast and reduced SNR of the images, thereby
requiring the segmentation algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge about the
geometry of the gland. In this paper, a novel approach to the problem of
segmenting the TRUS images is described. The proposed approach is based on the
concept of distribution tracking, which provides a unified framework for
modeling and fusing image-related and morphological features of the prostate.
Moreover, the same framework allows the segmentation to be regularized via
using a new type of ""weak"" shape priors, which minimally bias the estimation
procedure, while rendering the latter stable and robust.

measurements is regarded as a problem of central importance in various fields
of engineering and imaging sciences. In such cases, the degradation is
typically caused by the resolution limitations of an imaging device in use
and/or by the destructive influence of measurement noise. Specifically, when
the noise obeys a Poisson probability law, standard approaches to the problem
of image reconstruction are based on using fixed-point algorithms which follow
the methodology first proposed by Richardson and Lucy. The practice of using
these methods, however, shows that their convergence properties tend to
deteriorate at relatively high noise levels. Accordingly, in the present paper,
a novel method for de-noising and/or de-blurring of digital images corrupted by
Poisson noise is introduced. The proposed method is derived under the
assumption that the image of interest can be sparsely represented in the domain
of a linear transform. Consequently, a shrinkage-based iterative procedure is
proposed, which guarantees the solution to converge to the global maximizer of
an associated maximum-a-posteriori criterion. It is shown in a series of both
computer-simulated and real-life experiments that the proposed method
outperforms a number of existing alternatives in terms of stability, precision,
and computational efficiency.

between the two stable sites is evaluated using the nudged elastic band method,
where an energy barrier for a translational motion of the adsorbed oxygen may
become sim 0.45 eV, which is low enough to allow fluxionality of the surface
oxygen at high temperatures. The oxygen fluxionality is allowed by existence of
2-fold-coordinated Pd atoms on the PdO film, whose local structure has
similarity to that of Pd catalysts for the Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling.
Although NO_x (including NO_2 and NO) reduction is not always catalyzed only by
the PdO film, we conclude that there may happen continual redox reactions
mediated by oxygen-adsorbed PdO films over a Pd surface structure, when the
influx of NO_x and CO continues, and when the reaction cycle is kept on a
well-designed oxygen surface.

parameters, such as, accretion rate ($\dot {\cal M}$) and angular momentum

flow is located at few tens of Schwarzchild radius and it is generally very hot
and dense. This successfully mimics the so called Compton cloud which is
believed to be responsible for emitting hard radiations. Due to the radiative
loss, a significant energy from the accreting matter is removed and the shock
moves forward towards the black hole in order to maintain the pressure balance
across it. We identify the effective area of the parameter space ($\dot {\cal
M} - \lambda$) which allows accretion flows to have some energy dissipation at
the shock $(\Delta {\cal E})$. As the dissipation is increased, the parameter
space is reduced and finally disappears when the dissipation is reached its
critical value. The dissipation has a profound effect on the dynamics of
post-shock flow. By moving forward, an unstable shock whose oscillation causes
Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in the emitted radiation, will produce
oscillations of high frequency. Such an evolution of QPOs has been observed in
several black hole candidates during their outbursts.

It is well-known that the maximum winning probability (value) of entangled

uniform, meaning that in an optimal strategy the marginal distributions of the
output of each player are uniform, then its entangled value can be efficiently

phase. At the same time, in this phase, the meson melting is observed through
the quasi-normal modes of meson spectrum. Possible ideas are given for the

the second solar spectrum by the Ba II line at 4554 A has been interpreted as
the result of the different contributions coming from the barium isotopes with
and without hyperfine structure (HFS). In the same spectrum, a triple peak
polarization signal is also observed in the Sc II line at 4247 A. Scandium has
a single stable isotope (^{45}Sc), which shows HFS due to a nuclear spin I=7/2.
We investigate the possibility of interpreting the linear polarization profile
shown in the second solar spectrum by this Sc II line in terms of HFS. A
two-level model atom with HFS is assumed. Adopting an optically thin slab
model, the role of atomic polarization and of HFS is investigated, avoiding the
complications caused by radiative transfer effects. The slab is assumed to be
illuminated from below by the photospheric continuum, and the polarization of
the radiation scattered at 90 degrees is investigated. The three-peak structure
of the scattering polarization profile observed in this Sc II line cannot be
fully explained in terms of HFS. Given the similarities between the Sc II line
at 4247 A and the Ba II line at 4554 A, it is not clear why, within the same
modeling assumptions, only the three-peak Q/I profile of the barium line can be
fully interpreted in terms of HFS. The failure to interpret this Sc II
polarization signal raises important questions, whose resolution might lead to
significant improvements in our understanding of the second solar spectrum. In
particular, if the three-peak structure of the Sc II signal is actually
produced by a physical mechanism neglected within the approach considered here,
it will be extremely interesting not only to identify this mechanism, but also
to understand why it seems to be less important in the case of the barium line.

decline rate, and it confirms previous speculations about a correlation between
degree of polarization, expansion velocity, and HVF strength. The polarization
of CaII detected in our last epoch, the most advanced ever obtained for a Type
Ia SN, coincides in velocity with the outer boundary of the Ca synthesized
during the explosion (15,000-17,000 km/s) in delayed-detonation models. This
suggests a large scale chemical inhomogeneity as produced by off-center
detonations, a rather small amount of mixing, or a combination of both effects.
In contrast, the absence of polarization at the inner edge of the Ca-rich layer
(8000-10,000 km/s) implies a substantial amount of mixing in these deeper
regions.

investigate the role of the adiabatic index and gas temperature, and the flow
behaviour due to non-axisymmetric effects. Our 3-D simulations confirm
axisymmetric results: the material that has too much angular momentum to be
accreted forms a thick torus near the equator and the mass accretion rate is
lower than the Bondi rate.
  In our previous study of the 3-D accretion flows, for gamma=5/3, we found
that the inner torus precessed, even for axisymmetric conditions at large
radii. The present study shows that the inner torus precesses also for other
values of the adiabatic index: gamma=4/3, 1.2 and 1.01. However, the time for
the precession to set increases with decreasing gamma. In particular, for
gamma=1.01 we find that depending on the outer boundary conditions, the torus
may shrink substantially due to the strong inflow of the non-rotating matter
and the precession will have insufficient time to develop. On the other hand,
if the torus is supplied by the continuous inflow of the rotating material from
the outer radii, its inner parts will eventually tilt and precess, as it was
for the larger gamma's.

radio events whose brightness depends on the intensity of the interaction
experienced by the supernova ejecta with the circumstellar presupernova wind
material. The fact that CCSNe are intrinsically radio supernovae --albeit with
a huge range of different radio powers-- and hence unaffected by dust
absorption, together with the high resolution and high sensitivity provided by
current VLBI arrays, has been exploited to directly image the radio brightness
structure of CCSNe in nearby (D <= 20 Mpc) galaxies. This has allowed to gain
insight into the physics of both CCSNe and of the circumstellar medium (CSM)
with which they interact. In addition, ultra-high-resolution,
ultra-high-sensitivity radio observations of CCSNe in Luminous and
Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs, respectively) in the local
Universe, can be used to directly measure of the current CCSN rate and star
formation rate.

some CCSNe in nearby galaxies, and then present some of the most relevant
results obtained with high-resolution radio observations of (U)LIRGs in the
local Universe, aimed at directly detecting CCSNe via their radio emission, and
thus determine their CCSN and star formation rates, independently of models.
This is of particular relevance, in view of the fact that our estimates of star
formation (and CCSN) rates in high-z starburst galaxies relies on standard
relationships between far-infrared luminosity and star-formation rate. In
particular, I will present recently obtained results with the e-EVN on the

The
model is characterized by two energy thresholds, Eagg and Efrag, which
demarcate different types of impacts: If the kinetic energy of the relative
motion of a colliding pair is smaller than Eagg or larger than Efrag, particles
respectively merge or break; otherwise they rebound. We assume that particles
are formed from monomers which cannot split any further and that in a
collision-induced fragmentation the larger particle splits into two fragments.
We start from the Boltzmann equation for the mass-velocity distribution
function and derive Smoluchowski-like equations for concentrations of particles
of different mass. We analyze these equations analytically, solve them
numerically and perform Monte Carlo simulations. When aggregation and
fragmentation energy thresholds do not depend on the masses of the colliding
particles, the model becomes analytically tractable. In this case we show the
emergence of the two types of behavior: the regime of unlimited cluster growth
arises when fragmentation is (relatively) weak and the relaxation towards a
steady state occurs when fragmentation prevails. In a model with mass-dependent
Eagg and Efrag the evolution with a cross-over from one of the regimes to
another has been detected.

particles contributes to the total high energy gamma-ray flux and can initiate
a cascade, decreasing the effective gamma-ray opacity in the system. The aim of
this paper is to model the cascade emission and investigate if it can account
for the VHE gamma-ray flux detected by HESS from LS 5039 at superior
conjunction, where the primary gamma-rays are expected to be fully absorbed. A
one-dimensional cascade develops along the line-of-sight if the deflections of
pairs induced by the surrounding magnetic field can be neglected. A
semi-analytical approach can then be adopted, including the effects of the
anisotropic seed radiation field from the companion star. Cascade equations are
numerically solved, yielding the density of pairs and photons. In LS 5039, the
cascade contribution to the total flux is large and anti-correlated with the
orbital modulation of the primary VHE gamma-rays. The cascade emission
dominates close to superior conjunction but is too strong to be compatible with
HESS measurements. Positron annihilation does not produce detectable 511 keV
emission. This study provides an upper limit to cascade emission in gamma-ray
binaries at orbital phases where absorption is strong. The pairs are likely to
be deflected or isotropized by the ambient magnetic field, which will reduce
the resulting emission seen by the observer. Cascade emission remains a viable
explanation for the detected gamma-rays at superior conjunction in LS 5039.

for the explanation of the homogeneity and flatness of the universe. In such
scenarios, the present cosmological expansion is preceded by a contraction
phase. However, during the contraction, in general the anisotropy of the
universe grows and eventually leads to a chaotic mixmaster behavior. This would
either be hard to reconcile with observations or even lead to a singularity
instead of the bounce. In order to preserve a smooth and isotropic bounce, the
source for the contraction must have a super-stiff equation of state with
$P/\rho=w>1$. In this letter we propose a new mechanism to solve the anisotropy
problem for any low-energy value of $w$ by arguing that high energy physics
leads to a modification of the equation of state, with the introduction of
non-linear terms. In such a scenario, the anisotropy is strongly suppressed
during the high energy phase, allowing for a graceful isotropic bounce, even
when the low-energy value of $w$ is smaller than unity.

isotropy is broken and can be revealed in cosmological observations, we
consider an SU(2) theory of gauge interactions in a single scalar field
inflationary scenario. We calculate the trispectrum of curvature perturbations,
as a natural follow up to a previous paper of ours, where we studied the
bispectrum in the same kind of models. The choice of a non-Abelian set-up turns
out to be very convenient: on one hand, gauge boson self-interactions can be
very interesting being responsible for extra non-trivial terms (naturally
absent in the Abelian case) appearing in the cosmological correlation
functions; on the other hand, its results can be easily reduced to the U(1)
case. As expected from the presence of the vector bosons, preferred spatial
directions arise and the trispectrum reveals anisotropic signatures. We
evaluate its amplitude tau_{NL}, which receives contributions both from scalar
and vector fields, and verify that, in a large subset of its parameter space,
the latter contributions can be larger than the former. We carry out a shape
analysis of the trispectrum; in particular we discuss, with some examples, how
the anisotropy parameters appearing in the analytic expression of the
trispectrum can modulate its profile and we show that the amplitude of the
anisotropic part of the trispectrum can be of the same order of magnitude as
the isotropic part.

Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonians for finite-size systems with open boundary
conditions. Finite size effects are highly relevant to ultracold quantum gases
in optical lattices, where an external trap creates smaller effective regions
in the form of the celebrated ""wedding cake"" structure and the local density
approximation is often not applicable. Specifically, for the Bose-Hubbard
Hamiltonian we calculate number, quantum depletion, local von-Neumann entropy,
generalized entanglement or Q-measure, fidelity, and fidelity susceptibility;
for the Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian we also calculate the pairing correlations,
magnetization, charge-density correlations, and antiferromagnetic structure
factor. Our numerical method is imaginary time propagation via time-evolving
block decimation. As part of our study we provide a careful comparison of
canonical vs. grand canonical ensembles and Gutzwiller vs. entangled
simulations. The most striking effect of finite size occurs for bosons: we
observe a strong blurring of the tips of the Mott lobes accompanied by higher
depletion, and show how the location of the first Mott lobe tip approaches the
thermodynamic value as a function of system size.

physics, addressing issues of plasma physics, high-energy physics, and
modelling of complex systems. It also poses societal consequences, with our
ever-increasing need for accurate space weather forecasts. Solar flares arise
naturally as a competition between an input (flux emergence and rearrangement)
in the photosphere and an output (electrical current build up and resistive
dissipation) in the corona. Although initially localised, this redistribution
affects neighbouring regions and an avalanche occurs resulting in large scale
eruptions of plasma, particles, and magnetic field. As flares are powered from
the stressed field rooted in the photosphere, a study of the photospheric
magnetic complexity can be used to both predict activity and understand the
physics of the magnetic field. The magnetic energy spectrum and multifractal
spectrum are highlighted as two possible approaches to this.

a layered structure in order to investigate spin dynamics in the paramagnetic
state. The linear scaling between the Knight shift $K$ at the P site and the
bulk susceptibility $\chi$ above $T_{\rm Curie}$ indicates that the P nucleus
is suitable for investigating magnetic properties. The temperature and magnetic
field dependences of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by the
temperature $1/T_1T$ at the P site show characteristic features of itinerant
ferromagnets, such as ZrZn$_2$ and Y(Co$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_2$. In addition, the
relationship between $1/T_1T$ and $\chi$ above $T_{\rm Curie}$ suggests that
ferromagnetic fluctuations possess a two-dimensional (2D) characteristic. The
present data show that LaCoPO is a unique ferromagnet, where the 2D
fluctuations anticipated from the crystal structure are predominant down to
almost $T_{\rm Curie}$.

right-handed sneutrino is a natural candidate for thermal dark matter.
Sneutrino annihilation at the present time can be considerably enhanced due to
the exchange of the lightest field in the Higgs sector that breaks U(1)_{B-L}.
The annihilation mainly produces taus (or muons) by the virtue of B-L charge
assignments. A sneutrino mass of 1-2 TeV provides a good fit to the PAMELA and
is compatible with the latest results from the FERMI experiment. In addition,
the sneutrino-nucleon elastic scattering cross section is within the reach of
the upcoming and future direct detection experiments.

25% and on average 68% faster than the best comparison-based sorting algorithm,
GPU Thrust merge sort, and on average more than 2 times faster than GPU
quicksort. Moreover, for 64-bit integer keys it is at least 63% and on average
2 times faster than the highly optimized GPU Thrust radix sort that directly
manipulates the binary representation of keys. Our implementation is robust to
different distributions and entropy levels of keys and scales almost linearly
