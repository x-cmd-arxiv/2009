SN2009ip and the 2009 optical transient in UGC2773 (U2773-OT), which were not
genuine SNe. Precursor variability in the decade before outburst indicates that
both of the progenitor stars were LBVs. Their pre-outburst light curves
resemble the S Doradus phases that preceded giant eruptions of eta Carinae and
SN1954J (V12 in NGC2403), with intermediate progenitor luminosities. HST
detections a decade before discovery indicate that the SN2009ip and U2773-OT
progenitors were supergiants with likely initial masses of 50-80 Msun and
$\ga$20 Msun, respectively. Both outbursts had spectra befitting known LBVs,
although in different physical states. SN 2009ip exhibited a hot LBV spectrum
with characteristic speeds of 550 km/s, plus faster material up to 5000 km/s,
resembling the slow Homunculus and fast blast wave of eta Carinae. U2773-OT
shows a forest of narrow absorption and emission lines comparable to that of S
Dor in its cool state, plus [CaII] emission and an IR excess indicative of
dust, similar to SN2008S and N300-OT. [CaII] emission is probably tied to a
dusty pre-outburst environment, and not the outburst mechanism. SN2009ip and
U2773-OT may provide a critical link between historical LBV eruptions, while
U2773-OT may provide a link between LBVs and SN2008S and N300-OT. Future
searches will uncover more examples of precursor LBV variability of this kind,
providing key clues that may help unravel the instability driving LBVs.

introduced by using a quaternionic Berry connection. This quaternionic

have accidental degeneracies are given with/without the KR degeneracy, which
describe the monopoles of Dirac and Yang. We have shown that the Yang monopole
is literally a quaternionic Dirac monopole. The generic Berry phases
with/without the KR degeneracy are introduced by the complex/quaternionic Berry
connections. As for the symmetry protected $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantization of these
general Berry phases, a sufficient condition of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantization

perform independent random walks on some underlying graph G. In addition,
particles on the same vertex merge randomly according to a given coalescing
mechanism. A remarkable property of mean-field coalescent processes is that
they may come down from infinity, meaning that, starting with an infinite
number of particles, only a finite number remains after any positive amount of
time, almost surely. We show here however that, in the spatial setting, on any
infinite and bounded-degree graph, the total number of particles will always
remain infinite at all times, almost surely. Moreover, if G=Z^d, and the
coalescing mechanism is Kingman's coalescent, then starting with N particles at
the origin, the total number of particles remaining is of order (log* N)^d at
any fixed positive time (where log* is the inverse tower function). At
sufficiently large times the total number of particles is of order (log*
N)^{d-2}, when d>2. We provide parallel results in the recurrent case d=2. The
spatial Beta-coalescents behave similarly, where log log N is replacing log* N.

decay of a single dipole emitter close to a spherical metallic nanoparticle is
re-examined. Taking a Ag spherical nanoparticle (AgNP) with the radius of 5 nm
as an example, a significant contribution (between 50% and 101% of the total
value) of higher-order multipoles to non-radiative rates is found even at the
emitter distance of 5 nm from the AgNP surface. On the other hand, the

Consequently, a dipole-dipole approximation can yield only an upper bound on
the apparent quantum yield. In contrast, the non-radiative rates calculated
with the quasistatic Gersten and Nitzan method are found to be in much better

black-hole geometry close to the event horizon is studied for the case of a
massless, conformal scalar field. The associated approximation to the unknown,
exact propagator in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state for small values of the
radial coordinate above $ r = 2M$ results in an analytic expression which
manifestly features its dependence on the background space-time geometry. This
approximation to the Hartle-Hawking scalar propagator on the Schwarzschild
black-hole geometry is, for that matter, distinct from all other. It is shown
that the stated approximation is valid for physical distances which range from
the event horizon to values which are orders of magnitude above the scale
within which quantum and backreaction effects are comparatively pronounced. An
expression is obtained for the renormalised $ <\phi^2(x)>$ in the
Hartle-Hawking vacuum state which reproduces the established results on the
event horizon and in that segment of the exterior geometry within which the
approximation is valid. In contrast to previous results the stated expression
has the superior feature of being entirely analytic. The effect of the
manifold's causal structure to scalar propagation is also studied.

sensitive probe of ionized gas down to column densities N(Si III) = 5x10^11
cm^-2 at Si III equivalent width 10 mA. We detect high-velocity Si III over
(91+/-4)% of the sky (53 of 58 sight lines), and 59% of the HVCs show negative
LSR velocities. Per sight line, the mean HVC column density is <log N(SiIII)> =
13.19 +/- 0.45, while the mean for all 90 velocity components is 12.92 +/-
0.46. Lower limits due to Si III line saturation are included in this average,
so the actual mean/median values are even higher. The Si III appears to trace
an extensive ionized component of Galactic halo gas at temperatures 10^4.0 K to
10^4.5 K indicative of a cooling flow. Photoionization models suggest that
typical Si III absorbers with 12.5 < log N(Si III) < 13.5 have total hydrogen

associated with higher density gas, n(H) > 1 cm^(-3), the corresponding neutral
hydrogen could be visible in deep observations. This reservoir of ionized gas

parameter of the universe in the Brans-Dicke theory. It is very interesting to
find that in the Brans-Dicke theory the agegraphic dark energy realizes
quintom-like behavior, i.e., its equation of state crosses the phantom divide
$w=-1$ during the evolution. We also compare the situation of the agegraphic
dark energy model in the Brans-Dicke theory with that in the Einstein's theory.
In addition, we discuss the new agegraphic dark energy model with interaction
in the framework of the Brans-Dicke theory.

interactions allow the existence of long-range ordered phases. Long-range
magnetic-dipolar interactions are at the heart of the explanation of many
peculiar phenomena observed in nuclear magnetic resonance, ferromagnetic
resonance, and Bose-Einstein-condensate structures. In this paper we show that
magnetic-dipolar-modes (MDMs) in quasi-2D ferrite disks are characterized by
symmetry breaking effects. Our analysis is based on postulates about a physical
meaning of the magnetostatic-potential function as a complex scalar wave
function, which presumes the long-range phase correlations. An important
feature of the MDM oscillations in a ferrite disk concerns the fact that a
structure with symmetric parameters and symmetric basic equations goes into
eigenstates that are not space-time symmetric. The proper solutions are found
based on an analysis of magnetostatic-wave propagation in a helical coordinate
system. For a ferrite disk, we show that while a composition of two helical
waves may acquire a geometrical phase over-running of during a period, every
separate helical wave has a dynamical phase over-running of and so behaves as a
double-valued function. We demonstrate that unique topological structures of
the fields in a ferrite disk are intimately related to the symmetry breaking
properties of MDM oscillations. The solutions give the MDM power-flow-density
vortices with cores at the disk center and azimuthally running waves of
magnetization. One can expect that the proposed models of long-range ordered
phases and space-time violation properties of magnetic-dipolar interactions can
be used in other magnetic structures, different from the
ferromagnetic-resonance system with reduced dimensionality.

scales, elaborating with the earth-moon system. A motivation is the bypass of
any hypothetical earth-bound medium as an explanation for the earlier null
findings. When the solar system 370 kms-1 motion relative to the cosmic
microwave background is taken into consideration, the higher value of receptor
velocity and the longer distance sets the stage for a confrontation between
Lorentzian and Galileo-Newton dynamical transformations. Two-way ranging time
carries along with it information about light's dynamical transformation, thus
a comparison of distance measured by ranging with that by parallax, a
geometrical method can reveal the correctness of assumptions underlying the
dynamical behaviour of light. Two-way ranging times unaffected by the 370 kms-1
velocity indicate null results and further buttress Einstein's relativity
theory, while ranging times affected by this velocity indicate non-null results

of the stochastic integrals $\int_0^{\infty-}c^{-N_{t-}^{(k)}} dL_t^{(k)}$ for
integers $k$ is investigated. Here $c>1$ and $(N_t^{(k)},L_t^{(k)})$, $t\geq0$,
is a bivariate compound Poisson process with L\'evy measure concentrated on
three points $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,c^{-k})$. The amounts of the normalized
L\'evy measure at these points are denoted by $p$, $q$, $r$. For $k=0$ the
process $(N_t^{(0)},L_t^{(0)})$ is marginally Poisson and $\mu^{(0)}$ has been
studied by Lindner and Sato (Ann. Probab. 37 (2009), 250-274). The
distributions $\mu^{(k)}$ are the stationary distributions of a sequence of
generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes structurally related in some way.
Continuity properties of $\mu^{(k)}$ are shown to be the same as those of
$\mu^{(0)}$. The problem to find necessary and sufficient conditions in terms
of $c$, $p$, $q$, and $r$ for $\mu^{(k)}$ to be infinitely divisible is
somewhat involved, but completely solved for every integer $k$. The conditions
depend on arithmetical properties of $c$. The symmetrizations of $\mu^{(k)}$
are also studied. The distributions $\mu^{(k)}$ and their symmetrizations are
$c^{-1}$-decomposable, and it is shown that, for each $k\neq 0$, $\mu^{(k)}$
and its symmetrization may be infinitely divisible without the corresponding
factor in the $c^{-1}$-decomposability relation being infinitely divisible.
This phenomenon was first observed by Niedbalska-Rajba (Colloq. Math. 44
(1981), 347-358) in an artificial example. The notion of quasi-infinite
divisibility is introduced and utilized, and it is shown that a
quasi-infinitely divisible distribution on $[0,\infty)$ can have its
quasi-L\'evy measure concentrated on $(-\infty,0)$.

distributed inclusions in a half-space is investigated. The approach is based
on a multiple scattering analysis similar to the one proposed by Fikioris and
Waterman for scalar waves. The characteristic equation, the solution of which
yields the effective wave numbers of coherent elastic waves, is obtained in an
explicit form without the use of any renormalisation methods. Two
approximations are considered. First, formulae are derived for the effective
wave numbers in a dilute random distribution of identical scatterers. These
equations generalize the formula obtained by Linton and Martin for scalar
coherent waves. Second, the high frequency approximation is compared with the
Waterman and Truell approach derived here for elastic waves. The Fikioris and
Waterman approach, in contrast with Waterman and Truell's method, shows that P
and SV waves are coupled even at relatively low concentration of scatterers.
Simple expressions for the reflected coefficients of P and SV waves incident on
the interface of the half space containing randomly distributed inclusions are
also derived. These expressions depend on frequency, concentration of
scatterers, and the two effective wave numbers of the coherent waves
propagating in the elastic multiple scattering medium.

This Letter reports the empirical analysis on two large-scale web sites,
audioscrobbler.com and del.icio.us, where users are connected with music groups
and bookmarks, respectively. The degree distributions and degree-degree
correlations for both users and objects are reported. We propose a new index,
named collaborative clustering coefficient, to quantify the clustering behavior
based on the collaborative selection. Accordingly, the clustering properties
and clustering-degree correlations are investigated. We report some novel
phenomena well characterizing the selection mechanism of web users and outline
the relevance of these phenomena to the information recommendation problem.

the big-rip singularity will ruin the theoretical foundation of the holographic
dark energy scenario. To rescue the holographic scenario of dark energy, we
employ the braneworld cosmology and incorporate the extra-dimension effects
into the holographic theory of dark energy. We find that such a mend could
erase the big-rip singularity and leads to a de Sitter finale for the
holographic cosmos. Therefore, in the holographic dark energy model, the
extra-dimension recipe could heal the world.
