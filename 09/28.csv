right-handed quarks gives rise to an electromagnetic current parallel to the
magnetic field produced in noncentral heavy-ion collisions. The chiral
imbalance may be induced by topologically nontrivial gluon configurations via
the QCD axial anomaly, while the resulting electromagnetic current itself is a
consequence of the QED anomaly. In the Sakai-Sugimoto model, which in a certain
limit is dual to large-N_c QCD, we discuss the proper implementation of the QED
axial anomaly, the (ambiguous) definition of chiral currents, and the
calculation of the chiral magnetic effect. We show that this model correctly
contains the so-called consistent anomaly, but requires the introduction of a
(holographic) finite counterterm to yield the correct covariant anomaly.
Introducing net chirality through an axial chemical potential, we find a
nonvanishing vector current only before including this counterterm. This seems
to imply the absence of the chiral magnetic effect in this model. On the other
hand, for a conventional quark chemical potential and large magnetic field,
which is of interest in the physics of compact stars, we obtain a nontrivial
result for the axial current that is in agreement with previous calculations
and known exact results for QCD.

LSR060230.4+391059, and 2MASSJ052338.2-140302). We do not detect X-ray or radio
emission from any of the three sources, despite previous detections of radio
emission from BRI0021 and 2M0523-14. Steady and variable H-alpha emission are
detected from 2M0523-14 and BRI0021, respectively, while no H-alpha emission is
detected from LSR0602+39. Overall, our survey of nine M8-L5 dwarfs doubles the
number of ultracool dwarfs observed in X-rays, and triples the number of L
dwarfs, providing in addition the deepest limits to date, log(L_X/L_bol)<-5.
With this larger sample we find the first clear evidence for a substantial
reduction in X-ray activity, by about two orders of magnitude, from mid-M to
mid-L dwarfs. We find that the decline in both X-rays and H-alpha roughly
follows L_{X,Halpha}/L_bol ~ 10^[-0.4x(SP-M6)] for SP>M6. In the radio band,
however, the luminosity remains relatively unchanged from M0 to L4, leading to
a substantial increase in L_rad/L_bol. Our survey also provides the first
comprehensive set of simultaneous radio/X-ray/H-alpha observations of ultracool
dwarfs, and reveals a clear breakdown of the radio/X-ray correlation beyond
spectral type M7, evolving smoothly from L_{\nu,rad}/L_X ~ 10^-15.5 to
~10^-11.5 Hz^-1 over the narrow spectral type range M7-M9. This breakdown
reflects the substantial reduction in X-ray activity beyond M7, but its
physical origin remains unclear since, as evidenced by the uniform radio
emission, there is no drop in the field dissipation and particle acceleration
efficiency.

are only allowed to perform a limited set of operations. In a world that admits
superstrong correlations in the form of non-local boxes, our measure can be
used to analyze protocols such as superstrong random access encodings and the
violation of `information causality'. However, we also show that in such a
world no entropic measure can exhibit all properties we commonly accept in a
quantum setting. For example, there exists no`reasonable' measure of
conditional entropy that is subadditive. Finally, we prove a coding theorem for
some theories that is analogous to the quantum and classical setting, providing
us with an appealing operational interpretation.

over general memoryless channels in the presence of noiseless feedback, termed
posterior matching. Using this principle, we devise a (simple, sequential)
generic feedback transmission scheme suitable for a large class of memoryless
channels and input distributions, achieving any rate below the corresponding
mutual information. This provides a unified framework for optimal feedback
communication in which the Horstein scheme (BSC) and the Schalkwijk-Kailath
scheme (AWGN channel) are special cases. Thus, as a corollary, we prove that
the Horstein scheme indeed attains the BSC capacity, settling a longstanding
conjecture. We further provide closed form expressions for the error
probability of the scheme over a range of rates, and derive the achievable
rates in a mismatch setting where the scheme is designed according to the wrong
channel model. Several illustrative examples of the posterior matching scheme
for specific channels are given, and the corresponding error probability
expressions are evaluated. The proof techniques employed utilize novel
relations between information rates and contraction properties of iterated

regulate this divergence and argue that the dual black hole thermodynamics may

report on simulations for N up to 5 including the Pfaffian phase, and N up to

and Malanushenko (2008), plays a role in the kink instability for complex
equilibria, similar to twist helicity for thin flux tubes (Hood and Priest
(1979), Berger and Field (1984)). We support this hypothesis by a calculation
of additive self helicity of a twisted flux tube from the simulation of Fan and
Gibson (2003). As more twist gets introduced, the additive self helicity
increases, and the kink instability of the tube coincides with the drop of
additive self helicity, after the latter reaches the value of
$H_A/\Phi^2\approx 1.5$ (where $\Phi$ is the flux of the tube and $H_A$ is
additive self helicity).
  We compare additive self helicity to twist for a thin sub-portion of the tube
to illustrate that $H_A/\Phi^2$ is equal to the twist number, studied by Berger
and Field (1984), when the thin flux tube approximation is applicable. We
suggest, that the quantity $H_A/\Phi^2$ could be treated as a generalization of
a twist number, when thin flux tube approximation is not applicable. A
threshold on a generalized twist number might prove extremely useful studying
complex equilibria, just as twist number itself has proven useful studying
idealized thin flux tubes. We explicitly describe a numerical method for
calculating additive self helicity, which includes an algorithm for identifying
a domain occupied by a flux bundle and a method of calculating potential
magnetic field confined to this domain. We also describe a numerical method to
calculate twist of a thin flux tube, using a frame parallelly transported along
the axis of the tube.

elements suspected in the planet's interior and the paucity of volatiles
measured in its atmosphere. We describe the formation sequence of the icy
planetesimals formed beyond the snow line of the protoplanetary disk and
calculate the composition of ices ultimately accreted in the envelope of HD
189733b on its migration pathway. This allows us to reproduce the observed
volatile abundances by adjusting the mass of ices vaporized in the envelope.
The predicted elemental mixing ratios should be 0.15--0.3 times solar in the
envelope of HD 189733b if they are fitted to the recent O and C determinations.
However, our fit to the minimum mass of heavy elements predicted by internal
structure models gives elemental abundances that are 1.2--2.4 times oversolar
in the envelope of HD189733b. We propose that the most likely cause of this
discrepancy is irradiation from the central star leading to development of a
radiative zone in the planet's outer envelope which would induce gravitational
settling of elements. Hence, all strongly irradiated extrasolar planets should
present subsolar abundances of volatiles. We finally predict that the

required feedback of channel state information (CSI) can potentially result in
excessive overhead especially for high mobility or many antennas. This work
concerns efficient feedback for transmit beamforming and establishes a new
approach of controlling feedback for maximizing net throughput, defined as
throughput minus average feedback cost. The feedback controller using a
stationary policy turns CSI feedback on/off according to the system state that
comprises the channel state and transmit beamformer. Assuming channel isotropy

optimal control policy to be efficiently computed using dynamic programming.
Consider the perfect feedback channel free of error, where each feedback
instant pays a fixed price. The corresponding optimal feedback control policy
is proved to be of the threshold type. This result holds regardless of whether
the controller's state space is discretized or continuous. Under the
threshold-type policy, feedback is performed whenever a state variable
indicating the accuracy of transmit CSI is below a threshold, which varies with
channel power. The practical finite-rate feedback channel is also considered.
The optimal policy for quantized feedback is proved to be also of the threshold
type. The effect of CSI quantization is shown to be equivalent to an increment
on the feedback price. Moreover, the increment is upper bounded by the expected
logarithm of one minus the quantization error. Finally, simulation shows that
feedback control increases net throughput of the conventional periodic feedback
by up to 0.5 bit/s/Hz without requiring additional bandwidth or antennas.

temperatures (T_c_). The normal Hall coefficients (R_H_) have positive values
with magnitude of 1 - 1.5 x 10^-3^ cm^3^/C at room temperature for the all
samples. With decreasing temperature, we find two characteristic types of
behavior in R_H_(T) depending on T_c_. For thin films with lower T_c_
(typically T_c_ < 5 K), R_H_ start decreasing approximately below T = 250 K
toward a negative side, some of which shows sign reversal at T = 50 - 60 K, but
turns positive toward T = 0 K. On the other hand for the films with higher T_c_
(typically T_c_ > 9 K), R_ H_ leaves almost unchanged down to T = 100 K, and
then starts decreasing toward a negative side. Around the temperatures when
R_H_ changes its sign from positive to negative, obvious nonlinearity is
observed in the field-dependence of Hall resistance as to keep the low-field
R_H_ positive while the high-field R_H_ negative. Thus the electronic state
just above T_c_ is characterized by n_e_ (electron density) > n_h_ (hole
density) with keeping \mu_e_ < \mu_h_. These results suggest the dominance of
electron density to the hole density is an essential factor for the occurence

confirm the classifications of 22 of the 31 sources that can be classified

unclassifiable in the JHK8 scheme allow us to characterize regions of the
color-color diagrams that previously lacked spectroscopic verification,
enabling refinements to the JHK8 classification system. The results of these
new classifications are consistent with previous results concerning the
identification of the most infrared-luminous objects in the LMC. In particular,
while the IRS spectra reveal several new examples of asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars with O-rich envelopes, such objects are still far outnumbered by
carbon stars (C-rich AGB stars). We show that Spitzer IRAC/MIPS color-color
diagrams provide improved discrimination between red supergiants and
oxygen-rich and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars relative to those
based on 2MASS/MSX colors. These diagrams will enable the most luminous IR
sources in Local Group galaxies to be classified with high confidence based on
their Spitzer colors. Such characterizations of stellar populations will
continue to be possible during Spitzer's warm mission, through the use of IRAC

dynamics simulations of alkali silicate glasses, and the properties and
relevance of this local energetics to ion transport are studied. The absence of
relaxations on the timescale of ion transport proves the validity of a static
description of the energy landscape, as it is generally used in hopping models.
The Coulomb interaction among the cations turns out essential to obtain an
average energy landscape in agreement with typical simplified hopping models.
Strong correlations exist both between neighboring sites and between different
energetic contributions at one site, and they shape essential characteristics
of the energy landscape. A model energy landscape with a single vacancy is used
to demonstrate why average site--energies, including the full Coulomb
interaction, are still insufficient to describe the site population of ions, or
their dynamics. This model explains how the relationship between energetics and
ion dynamics is weakened, and thus establishes conclusively that a hopping
picture with static energies fails to capture all the relevant information. It
is therefore suggested that alternative simplified models of ion conduction are
needed.

alpha-enhanced initial composition. For these models, O is dredged to the

stochastic process. In this paper, we advocate a deterministic approach for
channel multiple-access. Each user is statically assigned a periodic protocol
signal, which takes value either zero or one, and transmit packets whenever the
value of the protocol signal is equal to one. On top of this multiple-access
protocol, efficient channel coding and network coding schemes are devised. We
illustrate the idea by constructing a transmission scheme for the tandem
collision network, for both slot-synchronous and slot-asynchronous systems.
This cross-layer approach is able to achieve the capacity region when the
network is bi-directional.

noise sensitivity of degree-$d$ polynomial threshold functions (PTFs). These
bounds hold both for PTFs over the Boolean hypercube and for PTFs over $\R^n$
under the standard $n$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Our bound on the
Boolean average sensitivity of PTFs represents progress towards the resolution
of a conjecture of Gotsman and Linial \cite{GL:94}, which states that the
symmetric function slicing the middle $d$ layers of the Boolean hypercube has
the highest average sensitivity of all degree-$d$ PTFs. Via the $L_1$
polynomial regression algorithm of Kalai et al. \cite{KKMS:08}, our bounds on
Gaussian and Boolean noise sensitivity yield polynomial-time agnostic learning
algorithms for the broad class of constant-degree PTFs under these input
distributions.
  The main ingredients used to obtain our bounds on both average and noise
sensitivity of PTFs in the Gaussian setting are tail bounds and
anti-concentration bounds on low-degree polynomials in Gaussian random
variables \cite{Janson:97,CW:01}. To obtain our bound on the Boolean average
sensitivity of PTFs, we generalize the ``critical-index'' machinery of
\cite{Servedio:07cc} (which in that work applies to halfspaces, i.e. degree-1
PTFs) to general PTFs. Together with the ""invariance principle"" of
\cite{MOO:05}, this lets us extend our techniques from the Gaussian setting to
the Boolean setting. Our bound on Boolean noise sensitivity is achieved via a
simple reduction from upper bounds on average sensitivity of Boolean PTFs to
corresponding bounds on noise sensitivity.

infinite one-dimensional homogeneous Poisson distribution of particles, using
an exponential cut-off of the pair interaction to control and study the
divergences which arise. Deriving an exact analytic expression for the
probability density function (PDF) P(F), we show that it is badly defined in
the limit in which the well known Holtzmark distribution is obtained in the
analogous three-dimensional case. A well defined P(F) may, however, be obtained
in the infinite range limit by an appropriate renormalization of the coupling
strength, giving a Gaussian form. Calculating the spatial correlation
properties we show that this latter procedure has a trivial physical meaning.
Finally we calculate the PDF and correlation properties of differences of
forces (at separate spatial points), which are well defined without any
renormalization. We explain that the convergence of these quantities is in fact
sufficient to allow a physically meaningful infinite system limit to be defined
for the clustering dynamics from Poissonian initial conditions.

with masses in the range 0.10-0.25Msun carried out with the multi-fiber
spectrograph FLAMES@ESO. Our aim is to better understand the disk-locking
scenario in very low-mass stars. We have derived radial velocities, vsini, and
full width at 10% of the Halpha emission peak. Using published measurements of
infrared excess as disk tracer, and equivalent width of the NIR CaII line
lambda8542, mid-IR difference [3.6]-[8.0]micron derived by Spitzer data, and
10% Halpha width as diagnostic of the level of accretion, we have looked for
any correlation between vsini divided by the radius and presence of disk and
accretion. Four low-mass stars are SB2 systems. The distribution of rotation
periods derived from our vsini measurements is unimodal with a peak of few
days. Our <sini> is lower than the one expected for a random distribution. We
find no evidence for a population of fast rotators close to the break-up
velocity. A clear correlation between vsini/R and Delta(Ic-K) has been found.
While for stars with no circumstellar disk a spread in the rotation rates is
seen, stars with a circumstellar disk show an abrupt drop in their rotation
rates by a factor of ~5. On the other hand, only a partial correlation between
vsini and accretion is observed when other indicators are used. The X-ray
coronal activity level shows no dependence on vsini/R suggesting that all stars
are in a saturated regime limit. The critical velocity is probably below our
vsini detection limit of 9 km/s. The ONC low-mass stars in our sample at
present seem to be not locked, but the clear correlation we find between
rotation and IR color excess suggests that they were locked once. In addition,
the percentage of accretors seems to scale inversely to the stellar mass.

made before, and innovations to the existing technology were introduced to
build this detector. This paper discusses these innovations and presents
further work on large area GEM development.
  A single-mask technique overcomes the cumbersome practice of alignment of two
masks, which limits the achievable lateral size. The holes obtained with this
technique are conical, and have a so-called rim, a small insulating clearance
around the hole in the substrate. Further refinements of this technique allow
greater control over the shape of holes and the size of rims. Also, an
improvement in homogeneity over large areas is expected.
  Simulation studies have been done to examine the effect of hole shape on the
behavior of GEMs. Such studies can help understanding how to use new
enhancements of the technique to optimize performance.
  Many potential applications for large area GEMs foresee large production
volumes. Production issues have been studied, and single-mask GEMs turn out to
be much more suitable for large scale production than standard GEMs.

Furthermore we determined abundances for 5 elements (O, Si, S, Ar, Fe) in four

bursts as cosmological probes for determining global cosmological parameters
complementing results from type Ia supernovae and other methods. This requires
a characteristics of the source to be a standard candle. We show that contrary
to earlier indications the accumulated data speak against this possibility.
Another method would be to use correlation between a distance dependent and a
distance independent variable to measure distance and determine cosmological
parameters as is done using Cepheid variables and to some extent Type Ia
supernovae. Many papers have dealt with the use of so called Amati relation,
first predicted by Lloyd, Petrosian and Mallozzi, or the Ghirlanda relation for
this purpose. We have argued that these procedure involve many unjustified
assumptions which if not true could invalidate the results. In particular, we
point out that many evolutionary effects can affect the final outcome. In
particular, we demonstrate that the existing data from Swift and other earlier
satellites show that the gamma-ray burst may have undergone luminosity
evolution. Similar evolution may be present for other variables such as the
peak photon energy of the total radiated energy. Another out come of our
analysis is determination of the luminosity function and the comoving rate
evolution of gamma-ray bursts which does not seem to agree with the cosmic star
formation rate. We caution however, that the above result are preliminary and
includes primarily the effect of detection threshold. Other selection effects,

total volume $V=\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$, $N$ being the total number of particles. The
particles, referred to as $p$-spheres, have a linear size that behaves as
$v_i^{1/p}$ and our model thus represents a gas of polydisperse hard rods with
variable diameters $v_i^{1/p}$. We show that our model admits a factorized
steady state distribution which provides the size distribution that minimizes
the free energy of a polydisperse hard rod system, under the constraints of
fixed $N$ and $V$. Complementary approaches (explicit construction of the
steady state distribution on the one hand ; density functional theory on the
other hand) completely and consistently specify the behaviour of the system. A
real space condensation transition is shown to take place for $p>1$: beyond a
critical density a macroscopic aggregate is formed and coexists with a critical
fluid phase. Our work establishes the bridge between stochastic mass transport
approaches and the optimal polydispersity of hard sphere fluids studied in
previous articles.

leads to renormalized effective bend and twist rigidities that become
mode-number dependent. The strength and character of this dependence is found
to vary with bundle architecture, such as the arrangement of filaments in the

architecture, a uniform arrangement of filaments as found in F-actin bundles
and a shell-like architecture as characteristic for microtubules. Each
architecture is found to have its own universal ratio of maximal to minimal
bending rigidity, independent of the specific type of crosslink induced
filament coupling; our predictions are in reasonable agreement with available

based on coronagraph observations of CMEs' propagation and expansion. One is
the polytropic index $\Gamma$ of the CME plasma, and the other two are the
average Lorentz force and the thermal pressure force inside CMEs. By applying
the model to the 2007 October 8 CME observed by STEREO/SECCHI, we find that (1)
the polytropic index of the CME plasma increased from initially 1.24 to more
than 1.35 quickly, and then slowly decreased to about 1.34; it suggests that
there be continuously heat injected/converted into the CME plasma and the value
of $\Gamma$ tends to be 4/3, a critical value inferred from the model for a
force-free flux rope; (2) the Lorentz force directed inward while the thermal
pressure force outward, and both of them decreased rapidly as the CME moved
out; the direction of the two forces reveals that the thermal pressure force is
the internal driver of the CME expansion whereas the Lorentz force prevented
the CME from expanding. Some limitations of the model and approximations are

with J = 0.14 K is present, while in Cu6Co the Co3+ ion is diamagnetic and the
weak interaction is antiferromagnetic with J = -1.12 K. The NMR spectra show
the presence of non equivalent groups of protons with a measurable contact
hyperfine interaction consistent with a small admixture of s-wave function with
the d-function of the magnetic ion. The NMR relaxation results are explained in
terms of a single ion (Cu2+, Fe3+, Co3+) uncorrelated spin dynamics with an
almost temperature independent correlation time due to the weak magnetic
exchange interaction. We conclude that the two molecular magnets studied here
behave as single molecule paramagnets with a very weak intramolecular

Thus they represent a new class of molecular magnets which differ from the

cell (ETC) for the D1 transition of rubidium in an atomic vapor of natural
isotopic composition. All hyperfine transitions of both isotopes have been
studied for a wide range of laser power densities, laser detunings, and ETC
wall separations. Dark resonances in the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) were
observed as expected when the ground state total angular momentum F_g was
greater than or equal to the excited state total angular momentum F_e. Unlike
the case of ordinary cells, the width and contrast of dark resonances formed in
the ETC dramatically depended on the detuning of the laser from the exact
atomic transition. A theoretical model based on the optical Bloch equations was
applied to calculate the shapes of the resonance curves. The model averaged
over the contributions from different atomic velocity groups, considered all
neighboring hyperfine transitions, took into account the splitting and mixing
of magnetic sublevels in an external magnetic field, and included a detailed
treatment of the coherence properties of the laser radiation. Such a
theoretical approach had successfully described nonlinear magneto-optical
resonances in ordinary vapor cells. Although the values of certain model
parameters in the ETC differed significantly from the case of ordinary cells,
the same physical processes were used to model both cases. However, to describe
the resonances in the ETC, key parameters such as the transit relaxation rate
and Doppler width had to be modified in accordance with the ETC's unique
features. Agreement between the measured and calculated resonance curves was
satisfactory for the ETC, though not as good as in the case of ordinary cells.

its virtual motive is defined in terms of the Denef-Loeser motivic nearby

given by the motivic class of a general fiber. This allows us to compute the
generating function of the virtual motives of the Hilbert schemes of affine

commuting variety. We then give a formula for the generating function for
arbitrary X as a motivic exponential, generalizing known results in lower

component experienced a strong flare in which the flux density at 22 GHz
increased by $> 150%$ (45 mJy) in three months. Theoretical models of the flare
imply that the emission is likely enhanced by very strong Doppler boosting of a

that the long term time averaged kinetic energy flux of the secondary at

indicate that the secondary is seen through a shroud of free-free absorbing gas
with an emission measure of $\approx 10^{8} \mathrm{cm}^{-6}\mathrm{pc}$. The
steep spectrum secondary component appears to be a compact radio lobe that is
associated with a working surface between the ram-pressure confined jet, and a
dense medium that is likely to be the source of the free-free absorption. The
properties of the dense gas are consistent with the temperatures, displacement

is to focus on just symmetries that generate the symmetry group. Whilst there
are special cases where breaking just the symmetries in a generating set is
complete, there are also cases where no irredundant generating set eliminates
all symmetry. However, focusing on just generators improves tractability. We
prove that it is polynomial in the size of the generating set to eliminate all
symmetric solutions, but NP-hard to prune all symmetric values. Our proof

at the same wavelength, and is supplemented by VLBA archive data. In all, we
have used 2424 images spanning the years 1994-2007 to study and determine the
motions of 526 separate jet features in 127 jets. The data quality and temporal
coverage (a median of 15 epochs per source) of this complete AGN jet sample
represents a significant advance over previous kinematics surveys. In all but
five AGNs, the jets appear one-sided, most likely the result of differential
Doppler boosting. In general the observed motions are directed along the jet
ridge line, outward from the optically thick core feature. We directly observe
changes in speed and/or direction in one third of the well-sampled jet
components in our survey. While there is some spread in the apparent speeds of
separate features within an individual jet, the dispersion is about three times
smaller than the overall dispersion of speeds among all jets. This supports the
idea that there is a characteristic flow that describes each jet, which we have
characterized by the fastest observed component speed. The observed maximum
speed distribution is peaked at ~10c, with a tail that extends out to ~50c.
This requires a distribution of intrinsic Lorentz factors in the parent
population that range up to ~50. We also note the presence of some rare
low-pattern speeds or even stationary features in otherwise rapidly flowing
jets... (abridged)

and kinematics of a complete, flux-density-limited sample of Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN). Accelerations are measured from the apparent motion of individual
jet features or ""components"" which may represent patterns in the jet flow. We
find that significant accelerations are common both parallel and perpendicular
to the observed component velocities. Parallel accelerations, representing
changes in apparent speed, are generally larger than perpendicular acceleration
that represent changes in apparent direction. The trend for larger parallel
accelerations indicates that a significant fraction of these changes in
apparent speed are due to changes in intrinsic speed of the component rather
than changes in direction to the line of sight. We find an overall tendency for
components with increasing apparent speed to be closer to the base of their
jets than components with decreasing apparent speed. This suggests a link
between the observed pattern motions and the underlying flow which, in some
cases, may increase in speed close to the base and decrease in speed further
out; however, common hydro-dynamical processes for propagating shocks may also
play a role. About half of the components show ""non-radial"" motion, or a
misalignment between the component's structural position angle and its velocity
direction, and these misalignments generally better align the component motion
with the downstream emission. Perpendicular accelerations are closely linked
with non-radial motion. When observed together, perpendicular accelerations are
usually in the correct direction to have caused the observed misalignment.

optically selected type 1 (broad-line) Active Galactic Nuclei. Our primary
resource is the Hamburg/ESO Survey (HES), which provides a well-defined sample
of more than 300 optically bright AGN with redshifts z<0.3 and blue magnitudes
B<17.5. AGN luminosities were estimated in two ways, always taking care to
minimise photometric biases due to host galaxy light contamination. Firstly, we
measured broad-band B_J (blue) magnitudes of the objects over small apertures
of the size of the seeing disk. Secondly, we extracted H alpha and H beta broad
emission line luminosities from the spectra which should be entirely free of
any starlight contribution. The resulting AGN luminosity function (AGNLF) is
consistent with a single power law, also when considering the effects of number
density evolution within the narrow redshift range. We compared our AGNLF with
the H alpha luminosity function of lower luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxies by Hao
et al. (2005) and found a smooth transition between both, with excellent
agreement in the overlapping region. From the combination of HES and SDSS
samples we constructed a single local AGNLF spanning more than 4 orders of
magnitude in luminosity. It shows only mild curvature which can be well
described as a double power law with slope indices of -2.0 for the faint end
and -2.8 for the bright end. We predicted the local AGNLF in the soft X-ray
domain and compared this to recent literature data. We also compared the local
AGNLF with results obtained at higher redshifts and find strong evidence for
luminosity-dependent evolution, in the sense that AGN with luminosities around
M_B~-19 are as common in the local universe as they were at z=1.5, supporting
the 'AGN downsizing' picture (abridged).

  Channels","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a feedback scheme for transmitting secret messages
between two legitimate parties, over an eavesdropped communication link.
Relative to Wyner's traditional encoding scheme \cite{wyner1}, our
feedback-based encoding often yields larger rate-equivocation regions and
achievable secrecy rates. More importantly, by exploiting the channel
randomness inherent in the feedback channels, our scheme achieves a strictly
positive secrecy rate even when the eavesdropper's channel is less noisy than
the legitimate receiver's channel. All channels are modeled as binary and
symmetric (BSC). We demonstrate the versatility of our feedback-based encoding
method by using it in three different configurations: the stand-alone
configuration, the mixed configuration (when it combines with Wyner's scheme
\cite{wyner1}), and the reversed configuration. Depending on the channel
conditions, significant improvements over Wyner's secrecy capacity can be
observed in all configurations.

  Sitges, Barcelona, Spain",,"10.1063/1.3274146",,"nucl-th hep-ex hep-ph nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present our description of neutrino induced charged current quasielastic
scattering (CCQE) in nuclei at energies relevant for the MiniBooNE experiment.
In our framework, the nucleons, with initial momentum distributions according
to the Local Fermi Gas model, move in a density- and momentum-dependent mean
field potential. The broadening of the outgoing nucleons due to nucleon-nucleon
interactions is taken into account by spectral functions. Long range (RPA)
correlations renormalizing the electroweak strength in the medium are also
incorporated. The background from resonance excitation events that do not lead
to pions in the final state is also predicted by propagating the outgoing
hadrons with the Giessen semiclassical BUU model in coupled channels (GiBUU).
We achieve a good description of the shape of the CCQE Q2 distribution
extracted from data by MiniBooNE, thanks to the inclusion of RPA correlations,
but underestimate the integrated cross section when the standard value of MA =
1 GeV is used. Possible reasons for this mismatch are discussed.

is crucial to get the correct description of isentropic trajectories. The

to, but phenotypically different from other normally growing bacteria. These
so-called persister cells keep themselves in a dormant state and thus are
insensitive to antibiotic treatment, resulting in serious problems of drug
resistance. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy to ""kill"" persister
cells by triggering them to switch, in a fast and synchronized way, into
normally growing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics. The strategy is
based on resonant activation (RA), a well-studied phenomenon in physics where
the internal noise of a system can constructively facilitate fast and
synchronized barrier crossings. Through stochastic Gilliespie simulation with a
generic toggle switch model, we demonstrated that RA exists in the phenotypic
switching of a single bacterium. Further, by coupling single cell level and
population level simulations, we showed that with RA, one can greatly reduce
the time and total amount of antibiotics needed to sterilize a bacterial
population. We suggest that resonant activation is a general phenomenon in
phenotypic transition, and can find other applications such as cancer therapy.
