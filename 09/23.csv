cross-correlating SDSS DR7 and GALEX GR4+5 to catalog 428 SDSS and 165 other

substantial progress toward a sample of HeII quasar sightlines large enough,
and spanning a sufficient redshift range, to enable statistical IGM studies

density environments suggests that such episodes could drive the evolution of
at least a fraction of the early-type galaxy population. Their UV emission is
crucial to test whether these galaxies host ongoing/recent star formation. We
used far and near ultraviolet, optical, near infrared images, HI maps, and line
strength indices to investigate the nuclear and outer regions of the galaxies
as well as the regions where fine structures are present. The GALEX Near (NUV)
and Far UV (FUV) images of MCG-05-07-001 and NGC 1210 show complex tidal tails
and debris structures. The UV morphology of both galaxies appears so different
from the optical one that the early-type classification may not apply. In both
GALEX bands the polar ring of MCG-05-07-001 is the dominant feature, whereas an
extended tidal tail dominates the FUV bands of NGC 1210. In MCG-05-07-001 and
NGC 1210 there is a strong correlation between structures detected in the FUV
and NUV bands and in HI. NGC 5329 does not show evidence of shells in the UV.
We try to constrain the age of the accretion episode or merger which gave rise
to the shells and polar rings with the aid of composite stellar populations
that take the presence of dust into account. The presence of HI in both
MCG-05-07-001 and NGC 1210 argues in favour of wet mergers. Models suggest the
presence of very young stellar populations in MCG-05-07-001: the observations
could be explained in the framework of a conspicuous burst of star formation
that occurred <=1 Gyr ago and involved a large fraction of the galaxy mass. Our
models suggest that also the nuclei of NGC 1210 and NGC 5329 could have been
rejuvenated by an accretion episode about 2-4 Gyr ago. (abridged)

Dirac Hamiltonian can produce sound solitary-particle relativistic quantum
mechanics due to the ill effects of their negative-energy solutions; instead
their field-quantized wavefunctions are reinterpreted as dealing with particle
and antiparticle simultaneously--despite the clear physical distinguishability
of antiparticle from particle and the empirically known slight breaking of the
underlying CP invariance. The natural square-root Hamiltonian of the free
relativistic solitary particle is iterated to obtain the Klein-Gordon equation
and linearized to obtain the Dirac Hamiltonian, steps that have calculational
but not physical motivation, and which generate the above-mentioned problematic
negative-energy solutions as extraneous artifacts. Since the natural square
root Hamiltonian for the free relativistic solitary particle contrariwise
produces physically unexceptionable quantum mechanics, this article focuses on
extending that Hamiltonian to describe a solitary particle (of either spin 0 or
spin one-half) in relativistic interaction with an external electromagnetic
field. That is achieved by use of Lorentz-covariant solitary-particle four
momentum techniques together with the assumption that well-known
nonrelativistic dynamics applies in the particle's rest frame.
Lorentz-invariant solitary particle actions, whose formal Hamiltonization is an
equivalent alternative approach, are as well explicitly displayed. It is
proposed that two separate solitary-particle wavefunctions, one for a particle
and the other for its antiparticle, be independently quantized in lieu of
""reinterpreting"" negative energy solutions--which indeed don't even afflict
proper solitary particles.

understanding the factorization properties of QCD. The HERA experiment recently
provided precise data for rho electroproduction, including all spin density

between a hard (calculable) coefficient function, and hadronic (p and rho)
matrix elements. Such a factorization is up to now only proven for a
longitudinaly polarized rho. Within the kt-factorization approach (valid at
large s_{gamma* p}), we evaluate the impact factor of the transition gamma* ->

exaggerated confidence actually increases the probability of success. However,
overconfidence also leads to faulty assessments, unrealistic expectations, and

that, counter-intuitively, overconfidence maximizes individual fitness and
populations will tend to become overconfident, as long as benefits from
contested resources are sufficiently large compared to the cost of competition.
In contrast, ""rational"" unbiased strategies are only stable under limited

in a wide range of environments may help to explain why overconfidence remains
prevalent today, even if it contributes to hubris, market bubbles, financial

definition for the (conserved) spin current operator suitable for spin-3/2
holes, it is shown that the spin conductivity tensor exhibit very
distinguishable features from those obtained with the standard definition of
the spin current. This is due to a significant contribution of the spin-torque
term arisen from the alternative definition of spin current which strongly
affects the magnitude and the sign of the dynamic spin current. In the dc (free
of disorder) limit, the spin Hall conductivity for only (or dominant) {\it

$\sigma^{s,z}_{xy}(0)=-3e/8\pi$ for only (or dominant) {\it k}-cubic

absence of mapping the {\it k}-cubic Rashba $\leftrightarrow$ Dresselhaus
Hamiltonians. This asymmetry is also responsible for the non-vanishing dc spin
Hall conductivity ($\sigma^{s,z}_{xy}(0)=-6e/8\pi$) when the Rashba and
Dresselhaus parameters have the same strength, in contrast with its
corresponding case for electrons. These results are of relevance to validate

a pressing need to acquire better statistics about UV flaring and variability
in galaxy nuclei, both in terms of the number and monitoring of targets. The
Science Data Archive of the Hubble Space Telescope was queried to find all the
elliptical galaxies with UV images obtained in different epochs with the Wide
Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and possibly with nuclear spectra obtained
with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) in the region of the
Halpha emission line. These data were found only for the elliptical radiogalaxy
NGC 4278. The UV flux of the nuclear source of NGC 4278 was measured by means
of aperture photometry on the WFPC2/F218W images obtained between June 1994 and
January 1995. The mass of the central supermassive black hole (SBH) was
estimated by measuring the broad components of the emission lines observed in
the STIS/G750M spectrum and assuming that the gas is uniformly distributed in a
sphere. The nucleus of NGC 4278 hosts a barely resolved but strongly variable
UV source. Its UV luminosity increased by a factor of 1.6 in a period of 6
months. The amplitude and scale time of the UV flare in NGC 4278 are remarkably
similar to those of the brightest UV nuclear transients which were earlier
found in other LLAGNs. The mass of the SBH was found to be in the range between
7x10^7 and 2x10^9 M_sun. This is in agreement with previous findings based on
different assumptions about the gas distribution and with the predictions based
on the galaxy velocity dispersion.

transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with
different sizes, intensities (i.e. temperatures), and positions. Fitting the

The fits were either in spot longitude and radius, with a fixed intensity, or
in spots longitude and intensity, for spots of constant size. Before the

radius was estimated by fitting the deepest transit to minimize the effect of
spots. A slightly larger (3%) radius, 0.172 Rstar, resulted instead of the
previously reported 0.1667 Rstar . The fitting of the transits yield spots, or
spot groups, with sizes of ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 planet radius, Rp, with a

various impacts on gauge theories. In the first part of this thesis, we have
studied different aspects of symmetries in connection with various field and
string theoretic models. The manifestations of gauge symmetries and their
interconnection with the diffeomorphism invariances have been discussed in the
context of different generally covariant models like string, membrane,
$p-$brane and metric gravity. Analysis of interacting string with proper
inclusion of the stringy boundary conditions led to the noncommutative nature
of the string coordinates. In the second part of the thesis the emphasis was
primarily on the impact of gauge symmetries on the field theories defined over
noncommutative space-time. The correspondence between the NC gauge symmetry and
ordinary gauge symmetry manifest by Seiberg--Witten maps between the NC gauge
fields and ordinary gauge fields have been used to construct equivalent
commutative theories describing the original NC gauge theories. Using this
commutative equivalent approach we have analysed several NC gauge field
theories of current interest. A upper-bound on the time-space noncommutative
parameter has also been worked out.

  This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized

sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix.
The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this
subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the
desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its
classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims
are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.

not possible and we are studying the strong asymptotic stability property. The
behavior of spectra of mixed retarded-neutral type systems does not allow to
apply directly neither methods of retarded system nor the approach of neutral

to get the conditions of asymptotic non-exponential stability: the existence of
a Riesz basis of invariant finite-dimensional subspaces and the boundedness of
the resolvent in some subspaces of a special decomposition of the state space.

test statistics with quadratic forms used in association studies. The
statistics of interest do not necessarily follow a chi-square distribution and
take the general form $D=X^T A X$, where $X$ follows the multivariate normal
distribution, and $A$ is a general similarity matrix which may or may not be
positive semi-definite. We show that $D$ can be written as a linear combination
of independent chi-square random variables, whose distribution can be
approximated by a chi-square or the difference of two chi-square distributions.
In the setting of association testing, our methods are especially useful in two
situations. First, for a genome screen, the required significance level is much
smaller than 0.05 due to multiple comparisons, and estimation of p-values using
permutation procedures is particularly challenging. An efficient and accurate
estimation procedure would therefore be useful. Second, in a candidate gene
study based on haplotypes when phase is unknown a computationally expensive
method-the EM algorithm-is usually required to infer haplotype frequencies.
Because the EM algorithm is needed for each permutation, this results in a
substantial computational burden, which can be eliminated with our mathematical
solution. We assess the practical utility of our method using extensive
simulation studies based on two example statistics and apply it to find the
sample size needed for a typical candidate gene association study when phase
information is not available. Our method can be applied to any quadratic form
statistic and therefore should be of general interest.

as well as the UDF for our primary UBVi ""dropout"" sample. We correct the
observed distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. We find
that the UV-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantially
redder at z~2-4 than it is at z~5-6. Lower luminosity galaxies are also found
to be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z~2.5 and z~4. We do not find a
large number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections at
z~4, and particularly at z>~5, even though such sources could be readily
selected from our data. This suggests that star-forming galaxies at z>~5 almost
universally have very blue UV-continuum slopes, and that there are not likely
to be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z>~5 that are missed in
""dropout"" searches. Using the same relation between UV-continuum slope and dust
extinction as found to be appropriate at z~0 and z~2, we estimate the average
dust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and UV luminosity in a
consistent way. We find that the estimated dust extinction increases
substantially with cosmic time for the most UV luminous galaxies, but remains
small (<~2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. Because these same
lower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the UV, the
overall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. We include
the contribution from ULIRGs in our SFR density estimates at z~2-6, but find
that they contribute only ~20% of the total at z~2.5 and <~10% at z>~4.

environmental mechanisms in shaping the nature of the faintest galaxies known,
dwarf spheroidals (dSphs). In particular we discuss a model in which dSphs
originated from gas dominated, disky dwarfs that were accreted by massive
galaxies several billions of years ago. Dwarfs accreting at $z > 1$, when the
cosmic ultraviolet ionizing flux was much higher than today and was thus able
to keep the gas in the dwarfs warm and diffuse, were rapidly stripped of their
baryons via ram pressure and tidal forces, producing very dark matter dominated
objects with truncated star formation histories, such as the Draco dSph. The
low star formation efficiency expected in such low-metallicity objects prior to
their infall was crucial for keeping their disks gas dominated until stripping
took over. {\it Therefore gas stripping along with inefficient star formation
provides a new feedback mechanism, alternative to photoevaporation or
supernovae feedback, playing a crucial role in dwarf galaxy formation and
evolution}. Tidally induced instabilities, termed ""tidal stirring"", turned the
surviving stellar disk into a spheroid. Moreover, we examine the properties of
the newly discovered ultra-faint dSphs in light of this scenario and argue that
they likely belong to a different population of lower mass dwarf satellites.
These were mostly shaped by reionization rather than by environmental
mechanisms and are thus good candidates for being ""reionization fossils"". We
discuss implications of the morphological transformation scenario on the
substructure problem. (Abridged)

star-forming systems that match the observed number density of SMGs. In our
models, SMGs are massive galaxies sitting at the centres of large potential
wells, being fed by smooth infall and gas-rich satellites at rates comparable
to their star formation rates (SFR). They are not typically undergoing major
mergers that significantly boost their quiescent SFR, but they still often show
complex gas morphologies and kinematics. Our simulated SMGs have stellar masses
of log M*/Mo~11-11.7, SFRs of ~180-500 Mo/yr, a clustering length of 10 Mpc/h,
and solar metallicities. The SFRs are lower than those inferred from far-IR
data by a factor of 3, which we suggest may owe to one or more systematic
effects in the SFR calibrations. SMGs at z=2 live in ~10^13 Mo halos, and by
z=0 they mostly end up as brightest group galaxies in ~10^14 Mo halos. We
predict that higher-M* SMGs should have on average lower specific SFRs, less
disturbed morphologies, and higher clustering. We also predict that deeper
far-IR surveys will smoothly join SMGs onto the massive end of the SFR-M*
relationship defined by lower-mass z=2 galaxies. Overall, our simulated rapid
star-formers provide as good a match to available SMG data as merger-based
scenarios, offering an alternative scenario that emerges naturally from
cosmological simulations.

the fraction of 24 micron sources in a super galaxy group to the field and a
rich galaxy cluster at z~0.35. We draw on multi-wavelength observations that
combine Hubble, Chandra, and Spitzer imaging with extensive optical
spectroscopy (>1800 redshifts) to isolate galaxies in each environment and thus
ensure a uniform analysis. We focus on the four galaxy groups in supergroup
1120-12 that will merge to form a galaxy cluster comparable in mass to Coma. We
find that 1) the fraction of supergroup galaxies with SFR(IR)>3 Msun/yr is four
times higher than in the cluster (32% vs. 7%); 2) the supergroup's infrared
luminosity function confirms that it has a higher density of IR members
compared to the cluster and includes bright IR sources not found in galaxy
clusters at z<0.35; and 3) there is a strong trend of decreasing IR fraction
with increasing galaxy density, i.e. an IR-density relation, not observed in
the cluster. These dramatic differences are surprising because the early-type
fraction in the supergroup is already as high as in clusters, i.e. the
timescales for morphological transformation cannot be strongly coupled to when
the star formation is completely quenched. The supergroup has a significant
fraction (~17%) of luminous, low-mass, IR members that are outside the group
cores (R>0.5 Mpc); once their star formation is quenched, most will evolve into
faint red galaxies. Our analysis indicates that the supergroup's 24 micron
population also differs from that in the field: 1) despite the supergroup
having twice the fraction of E/S0s as the field, the fraction of IR galaxies is
comparable in both environments, and 2) the supergroup's IR luminosity function

A deep
secondary eclipse is detected at a level of 1.02+-0.20 x10-4, which suggests
that all of the planet-signal detected previously in white light by Alonso et
al. (2009) originates from the red channel. CoRoT-2b is the coolest exoplanet
that has been detected in the optical so far. In contrast to the other planets,
its measured brightness temperature of 2170+-55 K is significantly higher than
its maximum hemisphere-averaged effective day-side temperature. However, it is
not expected that a hot Jupiter radiates as a black body, and its thermal
spectrum can deviate significantly from a Planck curve. We present models of
the planet/star flux ratio as function of wavelength, which are calculated for
a T/P profile in radiative and hydrostatic equilibrium, using a self-consistent
atmosphere code. These are compared with the CoRoT detection, and with
measurements at 4.5 and 8 um from the Spitzer Space Telescope from Gillon et
al. (2009). We estimate that reflected light contributes only at a 10-20% level
to the total optical eclipse depth. The models allow for an 'extra absorber' to
be inserted at high altitude in the planet's atmosphere. This produces a
thermal inversion layer, recently invoked to explain the photometric reversals
and flux enhancements seen in some planets in the infrared. In the 0.5-1.5 um
wavelength range, the model-spectra of planets with an extra absorber at high
altitude, are relatively suppressed in flux compared to those without such
absorber. We therefore argue that, in contrast to the other exoplanets detected
in the optical so far, CoRoT-2b may not exhibit a significant thermal inversion
in its atmosphere, causing its optical brightness temperature to be boosted
above its maximum effective day-side temperature.

based on their X-ray and optical emission. They show column densities (N_H) at
soft energies (0.5-2 keV) mostly related to the diffuse emission around the
AGN, showing a correlation with the optical extinction. N_H at hard energies
(2-10 keV) seem to be much higher than what would be expected from the optical
extinction. They might be associated to the inner regions of the AGN, buried at
optical wavelengths. The main result of this paper is that around 50% of our
LINER sample shows signatures of Compton-thickness (CT) according to the most
common tracers: the X-ray spectral index, F(2-10 keV)/F([OIII]) ratio and
EW(FeKa). However, the EWs of CT LINERs are significantly lower than in CT Sy,
suggesting that the 2-10 keV emission is dominated by electron scattering of
the otherwise invisible AGN, or by emission from shocked gas associated to star
formation rather than by reflection from the inner wall of the torus. However,
no clear relation seems to exist between galaxies with optical dust lanes and
X-ray classified CT objects. This may suggest that CT sources should be related
to absorbing material located at the very inner regions of the AGN, maybe in
the putative dusty torus. Larger M_BH and lower Eddington ratios than Sy
galaxies have been found. This effect can be better attributed to LINER nuclei
being hosted by earlier morphological types than Sy nuclei. However, it has to
be noted that, once a proper correction to the X-ray luminosity is applied,
LINERs show Eddington ratios overlapping those of Sy 2. We speculate with a
possible scenario for LINER nuclei: an inner obscuring matter similar to that
of Sy 2, and an external obscuring matter responsible for the optical
extinction. CT sources appear to be more common among LINERs than Sy.

sequence H II -> Seyfert/Transition Object -> LINER -> Passive suggested by
optical data. In particular, we show that both Lx and Gamma, the slope of the
power-law that best fits the 0.5 - 8 keV spectra, are consistent with a clear
decline in the accretion power along the sequence, corresponding to a softening
of their spectra. This implies that, at z ~ 0, or at low luminosity AGN levels,
there is an anti-correlation between Gamma and L/Ledd, opposite to the trend
exhibited by high z AGN (quasars). The turning point in the Gamma -L/Ledd LLAGN
+ quasars relation occurs near Gamma ~ 1.5 and L/Ledd ~ 0.01. Interestingly,
this is identical to what stellar mass X-ray binaries exhibit, indicating that
we have probably found the first empirical evidence for an intrinsic switch in
the accretion mode, from advection-dominated flows to standard (disk/corona)
accretion modes in supermassive black hole accretors, similar to what has been
seen and proposed to happen in stellar mass black hole systems. The
anti-correlation we find between Gamma and L/Ledd may instead indicate that
stronger accretion correlates with greater absorption. Therefore the trend for
softer spectra toward more luminous, high redshift, and strongly accreting
AGN/quasars could simply be the result of strong selection biases reflected in
the dearth of type 2 quasar detections.

mere random subsample of optical quasars. No clear correlation between radio
activity and BH mass and/or accretion rate is evident from our data, pointing
to other BH properties, possibly the spin, as the driver of radio activity. We
have checked that our main results do not depend on any evident bias. We
perform detailed modelling of reasonable accretion histories for optical and

this idea in this work. We generate a generic theoretical expression for
retrograde precession in spinning disks that are misaligned with the orbital

we reduce our generic theoretical expression to those generated by others, or
to those used by others, to describe retrograde precession in protostellar,
protoplanetary, X-ray binary, non-magnetic CV DN, quasar and black hole

accretion stream must be addressed. Our analysis indicates that the best
description of a retrogradely precessing spinning, tilted, CV DN accretion disk
is a differentially rotating, tilted disk with an attached rotating, tilted
ring located near the innermost disk annuli. Our final, reduced expression for
retrograde precession agrees well with our numerical simulation results and
with selective observational systems that seem to have main sequence
secondaries. Our results suggest that tidal torques should be common to a

approximation algorithm with ratio $\frac{2}{\pi+1} \approx 0.4829$. The
previous best ratio, due to Alon et al., was $1/\pi \approx 0.3183$. Moreover,
the ratio of our algorithm is close to $2/\pi$ on a relatively broad class of
instances: for point sets whose perimeter (or diameter) is much shorter than
the maximum length matching. The algorithm runs in $O(n^{7/3}\log{n})$ time.
  (ii) For the longest non-crossing spanning tree problem, we give an
approximation algorithm with ratio 0.502 which runs in $O(n \log{n})$ time. The
previous ratio, 1/2, due to Alon et al., was achieved by a quadratic time
algorithm. Along the way, we first re-derive the result of Alon et al. with a
faster $O(n \log{n})$-time algorithm and a very simple analysis.
  (iii) For the longest non-crossing Hamiltonian cycle problem, we give an
approximation algorithm whose ratio is close to $2/\pi$ on a relatively broad
class of instances: for point sets with the product $\bf{<}$diameter$\times$
convex hull size $\bf{>}$ much smaller than the maximum length matching. The

were known for this problem.

interacting bosons, modeled as a disordered Josephson array, using a strong
randomness real space renormalization group technique. Unlike perturbative
methods, this approach does not suffer from run-away flows and allows us to
study the complete phase diagram. We show that the superfluid insulator
transition is always Kosterlitz- Thouless like in the way that length and time
scales diverge at the critical point. Interestingly however, we find that the
transition at strong disorder occurs at a non universal value of the Luttinger
parameter, which depends on the disorder strength. This result places the
transition in a universality class different from the weak disorder transition
first analyzed by Giamarchi and Schulz [Europhys. Lett. {\bf 3}, 1287 (1987)].
While the details of the disorder potential are unimportant at the critical
point, the type of disorder does influence the properties of the insulating
phases. We find three classes of insulators which arise for different classes
of disorder potential. For disorder only in the charging energies and Josephson
coupling constants, at integer filling we find an incompressible but gapless
Mott glass phase. If both integer and half integer filling factors are allowed
then the corresponding phase is a random singlet insulator, which has a
divergent compressibility. Finally in a generic disorder potential the
insulator is a Bose glass with a finite compressibility.

magnetic field and fractal membranes (or other equivalent microwave lenses) can
be used to detect high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) in the microwave
band. We study the signal photon flux, background photon flux and the requisite
minimal accumulation time of the signal in the coupling system. Unlike pure
inverse Gertsenshtein effect (G-effect) caused by the HFGWs in the GHz band,
the the electromagnetic (EM) detecting scheme (EDS) proposed by China and the
US HFGW groups is based on the composite effect of the synchro-resonance effect
and the inverse G-effect. Key parameters in the scheme include first-order
perturbative photon flux (PPF) and not the second-order PPF; the
distinguishable signal is the transverse first-order PPF and not the
longitudinal PPF; the photon flux focused by the fractal membranes or other
equivalent microwave lenses is not only the transverse first-order PPF but the
total transverse photon flux, and these photon fluxes have different
signal-to-noise ratios at the different receiving surfaces. Theoretical
analysis and numerical estimation show that the requisite minimal accumulation
time of the signal at the special receiving surfaces and in the background
noise fluctuation would be $\sim10^3-10^5$ seconds for the typical laboratory
condition and parameters of $h_{r.m.s.}\sim10^{-26}-10^{-30}$ at 5GHz with
bandwidth $\sim$1Hz. In addition, we review the inverse G-effect in the EM
detection of the HFGWs, and it is shown that the EM detecting scheme based only

line formation (LTE and non-LTE). For the O I 777 nm triplet, the

above the stellar photosphere. The MIPS observations reveal 19 excess sources
-- 8 A/F/G stars and 11 K/M stars -- that were not previously identified with
an 8um or 16um excess. The lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24um
excess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants of
optically thick primordial disks with inner holes. Despite the wide range of
luminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excess
characteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbital
radii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size with
spectral type. The results for Upper Sco are compared to similar photometric
surveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission.
After considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effects
of stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude of
the 24um excess around F-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 Myr as
found by previous studies, but at < 2.6 sigma confidence. For B7-A9 and G0-K5

for the non-Sommerfeld-enhanced case). We examine the effect of kinetic
decoupling on relic particle abundances when the interaction rate depends on
the velocity. For the case of pure p-wave annihilation, the effect of kinetic
decoupling is an increase in the relic abundance, but the effect is negligible
when the kinetic decoupling temperature is much less than the chemical
decoupling temperature. For the case of Sommerfeld-enhanced s-wave
annihilations, after kinetic decoupling occurs, annihilations continue to
change the particle abundance down to arbitrarily low temperatures, until
either matter domination begins or the Sommerfeld effect cuts off. We derive
analytic approximations to give the final relic particle abundances for both of
these cases.

representative of infalling groups in nearby clusters, this result suggests
that, in the local universe, the evolution of late-type galaxies belonging to

clusters such as Virgo is not significantly perturbed by pre-processing.

simulate the time evolution of thermal emission from the shock-heated dust in
the SNR and compare the results with the observations of Cas A SNR. We find
that the total mass of dust formed in the SN IIb is as large as 0.167 M_sun but
the average radius of dust is smaller than 0.01 mum and is significantly
different from those in SNe II-P with the massive H-envelope. In the explosion
with the small-mass H-envelope, the expanding He core undergoes little
deceleration, so that the gas density in the He core is too low for large-sized
grains to form. In addition, the low-mass H-envelope of the SN IIb leads to the
early arrival of the reverse shock at the dust-forming region. If the CSM is
more or less spherical, therefore, the newly formed grains would be completely
destroyed in the relatively dense shocked gas for the CSM density of n_H > 0.1
cm^{-3}. However, the actual CSM is likely to be non-spherical, so that a part
of grains could be ejected into the ISM without being shocked. We demonstrate
that the time evolution of the SED by thermal dust emission is sensitive to the
ambient gas density and structure that affects the passage of the reverse shock
into the ejecta. Thus, the SED evolution well reflects the evolution of dust
through erosion by sputtering and stochastic heating. For Cas A, we consider
the CSM produced by the steady mass loss of ~8x10^{-5} M_sun/yr during the
supergiant phase. Then we find the infrared SED of Cas A is reasonably
reproduced by thermal emission from the newly formed dust of 0.08 M_sun, which
consists of 0.008 M_sun shocked warm dust and 0.072 M_sun unshocked cold dust.

model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788

build-up of the disk through the merging of clumps. We perform the same

the level of resolution, the loss of angular momentum stays the same and can be
tied to dynamical friction during the build-up phase. This is confirmed in a
cosmological simulation. We also perform simulations including star formation
and star formation and supernova feedback. While the former has no influence on
the angular momentum problem, the latter reduces the loss to a level
potentially in agreement with observations. This is achieved through a
suppression of early star formation and therefore the formation of a large,
slowly rotating bulge. We conclude that feedback is a critical component to
achieve realistic disk galaxies in cosmological simulations. Numerical

have been highly variable during the two decades covered by the observational

colour. Non-LTE model atmosphere analysis of 4 epochs of K band spectroscopy
obtained between 2001-7 suggests that the photometric changes were driven by
expansion and contraction of the stellar photosphere accompanied by
comparatively small changes in the stellar temperature. Unclumped mass loss
rates throughout this period were modest and directly comparable to those of
other highly luminous LBVs. However, the bolometric luminosity of AFGL2298
appears to have varied by at least a factor of ~2 between 1989-2008, with it
being one of the most luminous stars in the Galaxy during maximum. Comparison
to other LBVs that have undergone non bolometric luminosity conserving

carried out by using a model-based approach of cluster analysis. The set of
observable parameters includes structural parameters, spectroscopically
determined Lick indices and radial velocities from the literature. The optimum
set of parameters for this type of analysis is selected through a modified
technique of Principal Component Analysis, which differs from the classical one
in the sense that it takes into consideration the effects of outliers present
in the data. Then a mixture model based approach has been used to classify the
globular clusters into groups. The efficiency of the techniques used is tested
through the comparison of the misclassification probabilities with those
obtained using the K-means clustering technique. On the basis of the above
classification scheme three coherent groups of globular clusters have been
found. We propose that the clusters of one group originated in the original
cluster formation event that coincided with the formation of the elliptical
galaxy, and that the clusters of the two other groups are of external origin,
from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies on random orbits around NGC 5128 for one
group, and from an accreted spiral galaxy for the other.

electron-positron pairs. Of particular interest is the possibility that dark
matter annihilations in the halo of the Milky Way provide this anomalous flux
of antimatter. The recent measurement of the cosmic ray electron spectrum by
the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope, however, can be used to constrain the
nature of any such dark matter particle. In particular, it has been argued that
in order to accommodate the observations of Fermi and provide the PAMELA
positron excess, annihilating dark matter particles must be as massive as ~1
TeV or heavier. In this article, we revisit Fermi's electron spectrum
measurement within the context of annihilating dark matter, focusing on masses
in the range of 100-1000 GeV, and considering effects such as variations in the
astrophysical backgrounds from the presence of local cosmic ray accelerators,
and the finite energy resolution of the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. When
these factors are taken into account, we find that dark matter particles as
light as ~300 GeV can be capable of generating the positron fraction observed
by PAMELA.

ones for the Milky Way's stellar halo, we perform a comparison of different
methods of distributing energy related to feedback processes to the surrounding
gas. A most promising standard model is applied to halos spanning a range of
masses in order to compare the results to disk galaxy scaling relations. With
few exceptions we find little or no angular momentum deficiency for our
galaxies and a good agreement with the angular momentum-size relation. Our
galaxies are in good agreement with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and the
slope of the photometric Tully-Fisher relation is reproduced. We find a
zero-point offset of 0.7 to 1 magnitudes, depending on the employed IMF. We
also study our standard feedback model in combination with additional physical
processes like a UV background, kinetic feedback, a delayed energy deposition
as expected for type Ia supernovae, mass return and metal-dependent cooling.
Only a combination of effects yields a real improvement of the resulting galaxy
by reducing the bulge, while including metal-dependent cooling increases the
bulge again. We find that in general the stellar mass fraction of our galaxies
is too high. In an ad-hoc experiment we show that an removal of the bulge could
reconcile this. However, the fit of the Tully-Fisher relation can only be
improved by delaying the star formation, but not suppressing it completely. Our
models do not seem to be efficient enough to achieve either effect. We conclude
that disk formation is a complex, highly interconnected problem and we expect a
solution to come from a combination of small effects.

Nontrivial effects are shown to emerge depending on the relative magnitude of
the modulation period and the relaxation time of the condensate. Specifically,
a nonadiabatic modulation drives the system out of thermal equilibrium: the
external field induces a variation of the quasiparticle energies, and, in turn,
a disequilibrium of the associated populations. The subsequent relaxation
process is studied and an analytical description of the gap dynamics is
obtained. Recent experimental findings are explained: the delay observed in the

fermion compound URu2Si2 realized in order to clarify the nature of the hidden
order (HO) phase which occurs below T_0 = 17.5 K at ambient pressure. The
choice was to measure at a given pressure P where the system will go, by
lowering the temperature, successively from paramagnetic (PM) to HO and then to
antiferromagnetic phase (AF). Furthermore, in order to verify the selection of
the pressure, a macroscopic detection of the phase transitions was also
achieved in situ via its thermal expansion response detected by a strain gauge
glued on the crystal. Just above P_x = 0.5 GPa, where the ground state switches
from HO to AF, the Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation disappears while the excitation
at the incommensurate wavevector Q_1 = (1.4, 0, 0) remains. Thus, the Q_0 = (1,
0, 0) excitation is intrinsic only in the HO phase. This result is reinforced
by studies where now pressure and magnetic field $H$ can be used as tuning
variable. Above P_x, the AF phase at low temperature is destroyed by a magnetic
field larger than H_AF (collapse of the AF Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) Bragg reflection).
The field reentrance of the HO phase is demonstrated by the reappearance of its
characteristic Q_0 = (1, 0, 0) excitation. The recovery of a PM phase will only
be achieved far above H_AF at H_M approx 35 T. To determine the P-H-T phase
diagram of URu2Si2, macroscopic measurements of the thermal expansion were
realized with a strain gauge. The reentrant magnetic field increases strongly
with pressure. Finally, to investigate the interplay between superconductivity
(SC) and spin dynamics, new inelastic neutron scattering experiments are
reported down to 0.4 K, far below the superconducting critical temperature T_SC
approx 1.3 K as measured on our crystal by diamagnetic shielding.

More recently, in the attempt to extend the same approach to the case of $f(R)$
theories of gravity, it was found that a non-equilibrium setting is indeed
required in order to fully describe both this theory as well as classical GR
(arXiv:gr-qc/0602001). Here, elaborating on this point, we show that the
dissipative character leading to a non-equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics is
actually related -- both in GR as well as in $f(R)$ gravity -- to non-local
heat fluxes associated with the purely gravitational/internal degrees of
freedom of the theory. In particular, in the case of GR we show that the
internal entropy production term is identical to the so called tidal heating
term of Hartle-Hawking. Similarly, for the case of $f(R)$ gravity, we show that
dissipative effects can be associated with the generalization of this term plus
a scalar contribution whose presence is clearly justified within the
scalar-tensor representation of the theory. Finally, we show that the allowed
gravitational degrees of freedom can be fixed by the kinematics of the local
spacetime causal structure, through the specific Equivalence Principle
formulation. In this sense, the thermodynamical description seems to go beyond
Einstein's theory as an intrinsic property of gravitation.

technology is a critical and unmet need in the management of personal

personal information and nonpersonal information. Personal information can be
either personal identifiable information (PII), or nonidentifiable information

distinction. At the conceptual level, PII is defined and formalized by
propositions over infons (discrete pieces of information) that specify
transformations in PII and NII. PII is categorized into simple infons that
reflect the proprietor s aspects, relationships with objects, and relationships
with other proprietors. The proprietor is the identified person about whom the

focuses on the PII spheres of proprietors. At the design level, the paper
describes databases of personal identifiable information built exclusively for

cigar-shaped trap and axial optical lattice, is studied in the framework of two
models described by two versions of the one-dimensional (1D) discrete
nonpolynomial Schr\""odinger equation (NPSE). Both models are derived from the
three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (3D GPE). To produce ""model 1""
(which was derived in recent works), the 3D GPE is first reduced to the 1D
continual NPSE, which is subsequently discretized. ""Model 2"", that was not
considered before, is derived by first discretizing the 3D GPE, which is
followed by the reduction of the dimension. The two models seem very different;
in particular, model 1 is represented by a single discrete equation for the 1D
wave function, while model 2 includes an additional equation for the transverse
width. Nevertheless, numerical analyses show similar behaviors of fundamental
unstaggered solitons in both systems, as concerns their existence region and
stability limits. Both models admit the collapse of the localized modes,
reproducing the fundamental property of the self-attractive BEC confined in
tight traps. Thus, we conclude that the fundamental properties of discrete
solitons predicted for the strongly trapped self-attracting BEC are reliable,
as the two distinct models produce them in a nearly identical form. However, a
difference between the models is found too, as strongly pinned (very narrow)
discrete solitons, which were previously found in model 1, are not generated by
model 2 -- in fact, in agreement with the continual 1D NPSE, which does not
have such solutions either. In that respect, the newly derived model provides
for a more accurate approximation for the trapped BEC.

are explored. We find our number of z'-drop candidates to be insufficient based
on the expected number of z' drops in a simple no-evolution scenario from the
z=3 Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function but we are consistent with the
observed luminosity function at z~6 (if all our candidates are real). However,
if one or both of our best z'-drop candidates are not z>6.5 galaxies, this
would demand evolution of the luminosity function at early epochs. We show that
the future surveys to be conducted with the ESO VISTA telescope over the next

envelope, but it is still a matter of debate how dust can form in their harsh
environment. In a few cases, a pinwheel-like structure of the dusty envelope
has been detected. Therefore, it has been suggested that dust formation in all
dusty WR stars might be linked to colliding winds in a binary system. We probed
the innermost region of the circumstellar dust shell of the deeply embedded WR
star WR 118. We carried out spectro-interferometric observations using the
AMBER instrument of ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer in low-spectral
resolution mode (R = 35). The K-band observations were obtained with three 1.8
m telescopes spanning projected baselines between 9.2 and 40.1 m. At high
spatial frequencies, the AMBER visibilities exhibit a prominent lobe,
indicating that the envelope contains one or several zones with a large local
intensity gradient. The strong closure phase signal clearly shows that the
circumstellar envelope of WR 118 can only be described by an asymmetric
intensity distribution. We show that a pinwheel nebula seen at low inclination
is consistent with the AMBER data. Its size was determined to be 13.9+-1.1 mas.
WR 118 possibly harbors a pinwheel nebula, which suggests a binary nature of
the system. According to our best model, the period of the system would be ~60
days (for d=3 kpc), making WR 118 the shortest-period pinwheel nebula known so
far.

atmospheres. We derive their CNO content (including the carbon isotopic ratio),
average metallicity, lithium, and light (Sr, Y, Zr) and heavy (Ba, La, Nd, Sm)
s-element abundances. The observed properties of the stars (galactic
distribution, kinematics, binarity, photometry and luminosity) are also
discussed. Our analysis shows that late-R stars are carbon stars with identical
chemical and observational characteristics than the normal (N-type) AGB carbon
stars. We confirm the results of the sole previous abundance analysis of
early-R stars by Dominy (1984, ApJS, 55, 27), namely: they are carbon stars
with near solar metallicity showing enhanced nitrogen, low carbon isotopic
ratios and no s-element enhancements. In addition, we have found that early-R
stars have Li abundances larger than expected for post RGB tip giants. We also
find that a significant number (aprox. 40 %) of the early-R stars in our sample
are wrongly classified, being probably classical CH stars and normal K giants.
In consequence, we suggest that the number of true R stars is considerably
lower than previously believed. We briefly discuss the different scenarios
proposed for the formation of early-R stars. The mixing of carbon during an
anomalous He-flash is favoured, although no physical mechanism able to trigger
that mixing has been found yet. The origin of these stars still remains a

gas, if present with higher densities, would lead to flatter radial profiles of
the dust density and surface brightness than those actually observed. However,
here we show that these profiles are surprisingly insensitive to variation of
the parameters of a central star, location of the dust-producing planetesimal
belt, dustiness of the disk and - most importantly - the parameters of the
ambient gas. This result holds for a wide range of gas densities (three orders
of magnitude), for different radial distributions of the gas temperature, and
different gas compositions. The brightness profile slopes of -3...-4 we find
are the same that were theoretically found for gas-free debris disks, and they
are the same as actually retrieved from observations of many debris disks. Our
specific results for three young (10-30 Myr old), spatially resolved, edge-on
debris disks (beta Pic, HD 32297, and AU Mic) show that the observed radial
profiles of the surface brightness do not pose any stringent constraints on the
gas component of the disk. We cannot exclude that outer parts of the systems
may have retained substantial amounts of primordial gas which is not evident in
the gas observations (e.g. as much as 50 Earth masses for beta Pic). However,
the possibility that gas, most likely secondary, is only present in little to
moderate amounts, as deduced from gas detections (e.g. ~0.05 Earth masses in
the beta Pic disk), remains open, too.

the dynamics of molecular clouds: both ambipolar diffusion and possibly the
Hall effect have been identified as significant. We present the results of a
suite of simulations with a resolution of 512-cubed of turbulent decay in
molecular clouds incorporating a simplified form of both ambipolar diffusion
and the Hall effect simultaneously. The initial velocity field in the
turbulence is varied from being super-Alfv\'enic and hypersonic, through to
trans-Alfv\'enic but still supersonic.
  We find that ambipolar diffusion increases the rate of decay of the
turbulence increasing the decay from $t^{-1.25}$ to $t^{-1.4}$. The Hall effect
has virtually no impact in this regard. The power spectra of density, velocity
and the magnetic field are all affected by the non-ideal terms, being steepened
significantly when compared with ideal MHD turbulence with exponents. The
density power spectra components change from about 1.4 to about 2.1 for the
ideal and non-ideal simulations respectively, and power spectra of the other
variables all show similar modifications when non-ideal effects are considered.
Again, the dominant source of these changes is ambipolar diffusion rather than
the Hall effect. There is also a decoupling between the velocity field and the
magnetic field at short length scales. The Hall effect leads to enhanced
magnetic reconnection, and hence less power, at short length scales. The
dependence of the velocity dispersion on the characteristic length scale is
studied and found not to be power-law in nature.

be identified as a qubit. It has recently been demonstrated that n-strongly
coupled spins can be collectively treated as an n-qubit system. Application of
algorithms in such systems, requires new approaches using transition selective
pulses rather than qubit selective pulses. This work develops a modified
version of Liouville space search algorithm, which is applicable for strongly

physics of strange and charmed quarks holds the potential to connect the two
energy domains, interpolating between the limiting scales of QCD. This is the
regime which will be explored using the future Antiproton Annihilations at
Darmstadt (PANDA) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research

  In this contribution some of the most relevant physics topics are detailed;
and the reason why PANDA is the ideal detector to study them is given.
Precision studies of hadron formation in the charmonium region will greatly
advance our understanding of hadronic structure. It may reveal particles beyond
the two and three-quark configuration, some of which are predicted to have
exotic quantum numbers in that mass region. It will deepen the understanding of
the charmonium spectrum, where unpredicted states have been found recently by
the B-factories. To date the structure of the nucleon, in terms of parton
distributions, has been mainly investigated using scattering experiments.
Complementary information will be acquired measuring electro-magnetic final

stays localized near the syncytial nuclei as observed in experiments. We
calibrate the parameters of the mathematical model with experimental data taken
during the cleavage stages 11 to 14 of the developing embryo of

coefficient of \textit{bicoid} mRNA is in the range 4.6\times

predictions and experimental measurements for the diffusion of macromolecules

AdS/QCD model, in order to implement confinement. The deformed model exhibits
interesting properties, especially in describing chiral symmetry breaking. The
expectation value of the scalar field $X$, which determines the quark mass and
condensate, approaches a constant in the IR limit, rather than blows up in the
original model. In contrast to the estimate in Ref. \cite{Shifman:2007xn}, this
kind of solution will not lead to chiral symmetry restoration for
highly-excited states, due to the property of the harmonic-oscillator equation.
Instead, it will guarantee the Regge behavior of the axial meson spectrum, and
also the pseudoscalar mesons. The value of the condensate can be fixed by
requiring that the pion be massless in the chiral limit, but only under some
approximation in the present model. We also find that, by relaxing the IR
boundary conditions, the unphysical massless state in the vector channel can be
eliminated.
