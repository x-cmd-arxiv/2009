even if the mass splitting between the neutral scalars is larger than M_Z, a

generating maximal/large mixing angles in the total mass matrix, where both the
sources have only small mixing angles. We show that in the two generation case,
maximal mixing can naturally arise only when the total neutrino mass matrix has
a quasi-degenerate pattern. The best way to demonstrate this is by decomposing
the quasi-degenerate spectrum in to hierarchial and inverse-hierarchial mass
matrices, both with small mixing. Such a decomposition of the quasi-degenerate
spectra is in fact very general and can be done irrespective of the mixing
present in the mass matrices. With three generations, and two sources, we show
that only one or all the three small mixing angles in the total neutrino mass
matrix can be converted to maximal/large mixing angles. The decomposition of
the degenerate pattern in this case is best realised in to sub-matrices whose
dominant eigenvalues have an alternating pattern. On the other hand, it is
possible to generate two large and one small mixing angle if either one or both
of the sub-matrices contain maximal mixing. We present example textures of
this. With three sources of neutrino masses, the results remain almost the same
as long as all the sub-matrices contribute equally. The Left-Right Symmetric
model where Type I and Type II seesaw mechanisms are related provides a
framework where small mixings can be converted to large mixing angles, for
degenerate neutrinos.

differ at the level of topology. The entanglement spectrum has been proposed as
a ground state property that captures characteristic edge excitations. Here we
study the entanglement spectrum for topological band insulators. We first show
that insulators with topological surface states will necessarily also have
protected modes in the entanglement spectrum. Surprisingly, however, the
converse is not true. Protected entanglement modes can also appear for
insulators without physical surface states, in which case they capture a more
elusive property. This is illustrated by considering insulators with only
inversion symmetry. Inversion is shown to act in an unusual way, as an
antiunitary operator, on the entanglement spectrum, leading to this protection.
The entanglement degeneracies indicate a variety of different phases in
inversion symmetric insulators, and these phases are argued to be robust to the
introduction of interactions.

look more like a minimum ionizing particle, while for high momentum muons (more

deposition from different detector components, we construct a boosted decision
tree discriminant to separate high momentum CHAMPs from high momentum muons.
This method increases substantially the CHAMP search potential and it can be
used to distinguish possible di-CHAMP or CHAMP-muon resonance models from
di-muon resonance models. We illustrate the new method using a mGMSB model and

evolves. Previous observational indications of these variations in the FIR and
submm spectral range are scarce and limited to specific regions of the sky. To
determine whether these results can be generalised to larger scales, we study
the evolution in dust emissivities from the FIR to mm wavelengths, in the
atomic and molecular ISM, along the Galactic plane towards the outer Galaxy. We
correlate the dust FIR to mm emission with the HI and CO emission. The study is
carried out using the DIRBE data from 100 to 240 mic, the Archeops data from
550 mic to 2.1 mm, and the WMAP data at 3.2 mm (W band), in regions with
Galactic latitude |b| < 30 deg, over the Galactic longitude range (75 deg < l <
198 deg) observed with Archeops. In all regions studied, the emissivity spectra
in both the atomic and molecular phases are steeper in the FIR (beta = 2.4)
than in the submm and mm (beta = 1.5). We find significant variations in the
spectral shape of the dust emissivity as a function of the dust temperature in
the molecular phase. Regions of similar dust temperature in the molecular and
atomic gas exhibit similar emissivity spectra. Regions where the dust is
significantly colder in the molecular phase show a significant increase in
emissivity for the range 100 - 550 mic. This result supports the hypothesis of
grain coagulation in these regions, confirming results obtained over small
fractions of the sky in previous studies and allowing us to expand these
results to the cold molecular environments in general of the outer MW. We note
that it is the first time that these effects have been demonstrated by direct
measurement of the emissivity, while previous studies were based only on
thermal arguments.

of integrated luminosity, of the proposed sLHC luminosity upgrade, of the ILC,
of CLIC, of the LHeC and of a muon collider. The four Working Groups considered
possible scenarios for the first 10/fb of data at the LHC in which (i) a state
with properties that are compatible with a Higgs boson is discovered, (ii) no
such state is discovered either because the Higgs properties are such that it
is difficult to detect or because no Higgs boson exists, (iii) a missing-energy
signal beyond the Standard Model is discovered as in some supersymmetric
models, and (iv) some other exotic signature of new physics is discovered. In
the contexts of these scenarios, the Working Groups reviewed the capabilities
of the future colliders to study in more detail whatever new physics may be
discovered by the LHC. Their reports provide the particle physics community
with some tools for reviewing the scientific priorities for future colliders

with the boundary between them consisting typically of collection of piecewise
smooth arcs (breaking curve(s)). In the first region the evolution of the
potential is ruled by modulation equations (Whitham equations), but for every
value of the space variable x there is a moment of transition (breaking), where
the solution develops fast, quasi-periodic behavior, i.e., the amplitude
becomes also fastly oscillating at scales of order epsilon. The very first

the detailed asymptotic behavior of the left and right edges of the interface

finding is that the first oscillations in the amplitude are of nonzero

curve in the (x,t)-plane, and of order epsilon ln(epsilon) in a transversal

temperature superconductor as a function of vacuum conditions in angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments. Normally, under less than ideal
vacuum conditions the carrier concentration of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O{8+x} (Bi2212)
increases with time due to the absorption of oxygen from CO2 and CO molecules
that are prime contaminants present in ultra high vacuum (UHV) systems. We find
that in a high quality vacuum environment at low temperatures, the surface of
Bi2212 is quite stable (the carrier concentration remains constant), however at
elevated temperatures the carrier concentration decreases due to the loss of
oxygen atoms from the Bi-O layer. These two effects can be used to control the
carrier concentration in-situ. Our finding opens the possibility of studying
the electronic properties of the cuprates as a function of doping across the
phase diagram on the same piece of sample (i.e. with the same impurities and
defects). We envision that this method could be utilized in other surface
sensitive techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy.

a total effective time of 24.4 hr during 2008 November and December. The
resulting upper limits on the gamma-ray emission above 100 GeV are in the range
of 4.6 to 7.5 x 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} for spectral indices from -1.5 to -2.5,
thereby constraining the emission produced by cosmic rays, dark matter
annihilations, and the central radio galaxy NGC1275. Results are compatible
with cosmological cluster simulations for the cosmic-ray-induced gamma-ray
emission, constraining the average cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure to <4% for
the cluster core region (<8% for the entire cluster). Using simplified
assumptions adopted in earlier work (a power-law spectrum with an index of
-2.1, constant cosmic ray-to-thermal pressure for the peripheral cluster
regions while accounting for the adiabatic contraction during the cooling flow
formation), we would limit the ratio of cosmic ray-to-thermal energy to
E_CR/E_th<3%. The upper limit also translates into a level of gamma-ray
emission from possible annihilations of the cluster dark matter (the dominant
mass component) that is consistent with boost factors of ~10^4 for the
typically expected dark matter annihilation-induced emission. Finally, the
upper limits obtained for the gamma-ray emission of the central radio galaxy
NGC1275 are consistent with the recent detection by the Fermi-LAT satellite.
Due to the extremely large Doppler factors required for the jet, a one-zone
synchrotron self-Compton model is implausible in this case. We reproduce the
observed spectral energy density by using the structured jet (spine-layer)
model which has previously been adopted to explain the high-energy emission of
radio galaxies.

with particle like solutions the so-called solitons. Using its integrability
one can define its quantum version without the process of canonical
quantization. This bootstrap method uses the fundamental propterties of the

scattering matrix as far as possible. The classical model can be extended with
integrable discontinuities, purely transmitting jump-defects. Then the quantum
version of the extended model can be determined via the bootstrap method again.
But the outcoming quantum theory contains the so-called CDD uncertainity. The
aim of this article is to carry throw the semiclassical approximation in both
the classical and the quantum side of the defect sine-Gordon theory. The CDD
ambiguity can be restricted by comparing the two results. The relation between
the classical and quantum parameters as well as the resoncances appeared in the

boundary conditions for planet formation. Although the dust in disks is
relatively easily detected as a far-IR photometric ``excess'' over the expected
photospheric emission, much less is known about the gas phase. It seems clear
that an abrupt transition from massive optically thick disks (gas-rich
structures where only ~1% of the total mass is in the form of dust) to tenuous
debris disks almost devoid of gas occurs at ~10^7 years, by which time the
majority of at least the giant planets must have formed. Indeed, these planets
are largely gaseous and thus they must assemble before the gas disk dissipates.
Spectroscopic studies of the disk gas content at different evolutive stages are
thus critical. Far-IR water vapor lines and atomic fine structure lines from
abundant gas reservoirs (e.g., [OI]63um, [SI]56um, [SiII]34um) are robust
tracers of the gas in disks. Spectrometers on board Herschel will detect some
of these lines toward the closest, youngest and more massive protoplanetary
disks. However, according to models, Herschel will not reach the required
sensitivity to (1) detect the gas residual in more evolved and tenuous
transational disks that are potentially forming planets and (2) detect the gas
emission from less massive protoplanetary disks around the most numerous stars
in the Galaxy (M-type and cooler dwarfs). Both are unique goals for
SPICA/SAFARI. Besides, SAFARI will be able to detect the far-IR modes of water
ice at ~44 and ~62um, and thus allow water ice to be observed in many
protoplanetary systems and fully explore its impact on planetary formation and
evolution.

ejection coupling in accreting stellar mass black holes. After a long period of
quiescence between 1999 and 2002, GX 339-4 underwent a series of 4 outbursts
that have been intensively observed by many ground based observatories [radio,
infrared(IR), optical] and satellites (X-rays). Here, we present results of
these broad-band observational campaigns, focusing on the optical-IR
(OIR)/X-ray flux correlations over the four outbursts. We found tight OIR/X-ray
correlations over four decades with the presence of a break in the IR/X-ray
correlation in the hard state. This correlation is the same for all four
outbursts. This can be interpreted in a consistent way by considering a
synchrotron self-Compton origin of the X-rays in which the break frequency
varies between the optically thick and thin regime of the jet spectrum. We also
highlight the similarities and differences between optical/X-ray and IR/X-ray
correlations which suggest a jet origin of the near-IR emission in the hard
state while the optical is more likely dominated by the blackbody emission of
the accretion disc in both hard and soft state. However we find a non
negligible contribution of 40 per cent of the jet emission in the V-band during
the hard state.
  We finally concentrate on a soft-to-hard state transition during the decay of
the 2004 outburst by comparing the radio, IR, optical and hard X-rays light
curves. It appears that unusual delays between the peak of emission in the
different energy domains may provide some important constraints on jet
formation scenario.

intersection order is graded and its rank generating function is the W-Eulerian
polynomial. Many order-theoretic properties of the shard intersection order,
like Mobius number, number of maximal chains, etc., are exactly analogous to
the corresponding properties of NC(W). There is a natural dimension-preserving
bijection between simplices in the order complex of the shard intersection
order (i.e. chains in the shard intersection order) and simplices in a certain
pulling triangulation of the W-permutohedron. Restricting the bijection to the
order complex of NC(W) yields a bijection to simplices in a pulling
triangulation of the W-associahedron.
  The shard intersection order is defined indirectly via the polyhedral

study of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH

Using the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two

for ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity
histogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight

giants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike''
consisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. By
carefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of these
stars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsic
velocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for And X, which for its
size, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of M/L =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming the
mass traces the light. Based on the clean sample of member stars, we measure
the median metallicity of And X to be [Fe/H] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slight
radial metallicity gradient. The dispersion in metallicity is large,
sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of its

matter particle. We use nested sampling to explore the CMSSM parameter space,
simultaneously fitting other relevant constraints from accelerator bounds, the
relic density, electroweak precision observables, the anomalous magnetic moment
of the muon and B-physics. We include spectral and spatial fits to the Fermi
observations, a full treatment of the instrumental response and its related
uncertainty, and detailed background models. We also perform an extrapolation
to 5 years of observations, assuming no signal is observed from Segue 1 in that
time. Results marginally disfavour models with low neutralino masses and high
annihilation cross-sections. Virtually all of these models are however already
disfavoured by existing experimental or relic density constraints.

z(abs) = 0.741, with a very high velocity dispersion sigma(lens) = 500 km/s,
which lenses a blue star-forming galaxy at z(em) = 1.433 into four images with
mean separation of about 6 arcseconds. The source shares many of its properties
with those of UV-selected galaxies z = 2-3: it is forming stars at a rate of 25
solar masses per year, has a metallicity of about 1/4 solar, and shows nebular
emission from two components separated by 0.4 arcseconds in the image plane,
possibly indicating a merger. It appears that foreground interstellar material
within the galaxy has been evacuated from the sight-line along which we observe
the starburst, giving an unextinguished view of its stars and H II regions.
CSWA 20, with its massive lensing galaxy producing a high magnification of an
intrinsically luminous background galaxy, is a promising target for future
studies at a variety of wavelengths.

detected and derived periods for 89 RR Lyrae stars (82 fundamental-mode -RRab-

that B514 is likely an Oosterhoff type I cluster. This appears to be in
disagreement with the general behaviour of the metal-poor globular clusters in
the Milky Way, which show instead Oosterhoff type II pulsation properties. The
average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars sets the mean level of the

internal growth of structure and instabilities dominates the growth via
external drivers (e.g. accretion/mergers). Most study has focused on 'isolated'
galaxies, where seed asymmetries may represent realistic cosmological
substructure, but subsequent evolution ignores galaxy growth. Large-scale modes
in the disk then grow on a timescale of order a disk rotation period (0.1-1
Gyr). If, however, galaxies evolve cosmologically on a shorter timescale, then
it may not be appropriate to consider them 'isolated.' We outline simple
scalings to ask whether the timescale for secular evolution is shorter than the
timescale for cosmological accretion and mergers. This is the case in a narrow,
but important range of perturbation amplitudes corresponding to substructure or
mode/bar fractional amplitudes 0.01-0.1, a range of interest for observed
strong bars and pseudobulges. At smaller amplitudes <<0.1, systems are not
isolated: typical disks will grow by accretion at a comparable level over even
a single dynamical time. At larger amplitudes >>0.1, the evolution is no longer
secular; direct gravitational evolution of the seed swamps the internal disk
response. We derive criteria for when disks can be well-approximated as
'isolated' as a function of mass, redshift, and disk stability. The relevant
parameter space shrinks at higher mass, higher disk stability, and higher-z as
accretion rates increase. Cosmological rates of galaxy evolution also define a
maximum bar/mode lifetime of practical interest, of ~0.1/H(z). Longer-lived
modes will de-couple from their drivers (if driven) and encounter cosmological
effects.

mapped sources, which were identified with eight pre-UC HII regions and one UC
HII region, two high-mass cores earlier than pre-UC HII phase, four possible

stellar reflections appear as out-of-focus images and are not necessarily

calibration images we are able to measure the position, size, and intensity of
reflections as a function of their position on the field. We also measure the
extended stellar point-spread function out to one degree. Together this
information can be used to create an empirical model of the excess light from
bright stars and reduce systematic artifacts in deep surface photometry. We
then reduce a set of deep observations of the Virgo cluster with our method to
demonstrate its efficacy and to provide a comparison with other strategies for

$k$ if the function value is uncorrelated with the values of any $k$ of the
arguments. Such functions are of considerable interest due to their
cryptographic properties, and are also related to the orthogonal arrays of
statistics and the balanced hypercube colourings of combinatorics. The {weight}
of a boolean function is the number of argument values that produce a function
value of 1. If this is exactly half the argument values, that is, $2^{n-1}$
values, a correlation-immune function is called {resilient}.
  An asymptotic estimate of the number $N(n,k)$ of $n$-variable
correlation-immune boolean functions of order $k$ was obtained in 1992 by
Denisov for constant $k$. Denisov repudiated that estimate in 2000, but we will
show that the repudiation was a mistake.
  The main contribution of this paper is an asymptotic estimate of $N(n,k)$
which holds if $k$ increases with $n$ within generous limits and specialises to
functions with a given weight, including the resilient functions. In the case
of $k=1$, our estimates are valid for all weights.

astrophysics as the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of
gravity during the entire wave-generation and propagation regime. Such an
assumption is valid in the weak field, as verified by precision experiments and
observations, but it need not hold in the dynamical strong-field regime where
tests are lacking. Fundamental bias can cause systematic errors in the
detection and parameter estimation of signals, which can lead to a
mischaracterization of the universe through incorrect inferences about source
event rates and populations. We propose a remedy through the introduction of
the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework, which consists of the enhancement
of waveform templates via the inclusion of post-Einsteinian parameters. These
parameters would ostensibly be designed to interpolate between templates
constructed in general relativity and well-motivated alternative theories of
gravity, and also include extrapolations that follow sound theoretical
principles, such as consistency with conservation laws and symmetries. As an
example, we construct parameterized post-Einsteinian templates for the binary
coalescence of equal-mass, non-spinning compact objects in a quasi-circular
inspiral. The parametrized post-Einsteinian framework should allow matched
filtered data to select a specific set of post-Einsteinian parameters without a
priori assuming the validity of the former, thus either verifying general
relativity or pointing to possible dynamical strong-field deviations.

of selecting the number of beams in intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT). The second purpose is to illuminate the related issue of discrete
static beam angles vs. rotational techniques, which has recently re-surfaced
due to the advancement of volumetric arc therapy (VMAT). A specific objective
is to find analytical expressions that allow one to address the points raised
above. To make the problem mathematically tractable, it is assumed that the
depth dose is flat and that the lateral dose profile can be approximated by
polynomials, specifically Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, of finite
degree. The application of methods known from image reconstruction then allows
one to answer the first question above as follows: The required number of beams
is determined by the maximum degree of the polynomials used in the
approximation of the beam profiles, which is a measure of the dose variability.
There is nothing to be gained by using more beams. In realistic cases, in which
the variability of the lateral dose profile is restricted in several ways, the
required number of beams is of the order of 10 to 20. The consequence of
delivering the beams with a `leaf sweep' technique during continuous rotation
of the gantry, as in VMAT, is also derived in analytical form. The main effect
is that the beams fan out, but the effect near the axis of rotation is small.
This result can serve as a theoretical justification of VMAT. Overall the
analytical derivations in this paper, albeit based on strong simplifications,
provide new insights into, and a deeper understanding of, the beam angle
problem in IMRT.

matching in a d-regular bipartite graph on 2n nodes with m=nd edges. The
best-known algorithm for general bipartite graphs (due to Hopcroft and Karp)
takes time O(m\sqrt{n}). In regular bipartite graphs, however, a matching is
known to be computable in O(m) time (due to Cole, Ost and Schirra). In a recent
line of work by Goel, Kapralov and Khanna the O(m) time algorithm was improved
first to \tilde O(min{m, n^{2.5}/d}) and then to \tilde O(min{m, n^2/d}). It
was also shown that the latter algorithm is optimal up to polylogarithmic
factors among all algorithms that use non-adaptive uniform sampling to reduce
the size of the graph as a first step.
  In this paper, we give a randomized algorithm that finds a perfect matching
in a d-regular graph and runs in O(n\log n) time (both in expectation and with
high probability). The algorithm performs an appropriately truncated random
walk on a modified graph to successively find augmenting paths. Our algorithm
may be viewed as using adaptive uniform sampling, and is thus able to bypass
the limitations of (non-adaptive) uniform sampling established in earlier work.
We also show that randomization is crucial for obtaining o(nd) time algorithms
by establishing an \Omega(nd) lower bound for any deterministic algorithm. Our
techniques also give an algorithm that successively finds a matching in the
support of a doubly stochastic matrix in expected time O(n\log^2 n) time, with
O(m) pre-processing time; this gives a simple O(m+mn\log^2 n) time algorithm
for finding the Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition of a doubly stochastic
matrix.

and random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a
critical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA
networks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we
first formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique
CSMA characteristics not captured by existing interference models in the
literature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently
the capacity of CSMA networks. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA
scheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to
maximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA
can achieve throughput as $\Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, the same order as
optimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks. Our CSMA scheme makes use
of an efficient backbone-peripheral routing scheme and a careful design of dual
carrier-sensing and dual channel scheme. We also address the implementation

ultra-compact X-ray binaries) with emphasis on the surface chemical abundances
of the donors in these systems. Hydrogen is not convincingly detected in the
spectra of these systems. Three different proposed formation scenarios involve
different donor stars, white dwarfs, helium stars or evolved main-sequence
stars. Using detailed evolutionary calculations we show that the abundances of
helium WD donors and evolved main-sequence stars are close to equilibrium
CNO-processed material, and the detailed abundances correlate with the core
temperature and thus mass of the MS progenitors. Evolved MS donors typically
have traces of H left. For hybrid or CO white dwarf donors, the carbon and
oxygen abundances depend on the temperature of the helium burning and thus on
the helium core mass of the progenitors. For helium star donors in addition to
their mass, the abundances depend strongly on the amount of helium burnt before
mass transfer starts and can range from unprocessed and thus almost equal to
CNO-processed matter, to strongly processed and thus C/O rich and N-deficient.
We briefly discuss the relative frequency of these cases for helium star
donors, based on population synthesis results. Finally we give diagnostics for
applying our results to observed systems and find that the most important test
is the N/C ratio, which can indicate the formation scenario as well as, in some
cases, the mass of the progenitor of the donor. In addition, if observed, the
N/O, O/He and O/C ratios can distinguish between helium star and WD donors.
Applied to the known systems we find evidence for WD donors in the AM CVn
systems GP Com, CE 315 and SDSS J0804+16 and evidence for hybrid WD or very

element (Zr, Ba) studies of individual, submicrometer-sized SiC grains. The
most striking results are: (1) Zr and Ba concentrations are higher in Y and Z

up to 70x (Zr) and 170x (Ba), respectively. (2) For the Y and Z grains there is
a positive correlation between Ba concentrations and amount of s-process Si.
This correlation is well explained by predictions for 2-3 Msun AGB stars with
metallicities of 0.3-0.5x solar. This confirms low-metallicity stars as most

component, with a zero point consistent with that obtained by high spatial
resolution, ground based observations. The residual is independent of the
adopted passive template. This indicates that the 10 micron silicate emission
shown in spectra of M 87 can be entirely accounted for by the underlying old

absence of a finite net thermal bias. The application of an unbiased,
time-periodic temperature modulation of the leads entails a dynamical breaking
of reflection symmetry, such that a directed heat current may emerge (ratchet
effect). In particular, we consider two cases of adiabatically slow driving,
namely (i) periodic temperature modulation of only one lead and (ii)
temperature modulation of both leads with an ac driving that contains a second
harmonic, thus generating harmonic mixing. Both scenarios yield sizeable
directed heat currents which should be detectable with present techniques.
Adding a static thermal bias, allows one to compute the heat current-thermal
load characteristics which includes the ratchet effect of negative thermal bias
with positive-valued heat flow against the thermal bias, up to the thermal
stop-load. The ratchet heat flow in turn generates also an electric current. An
applied electric stop-voltage, yielding effective zero electric current flow,
then mimics a solely heat-ratchet-induced thermopower (``ratchet Seebeck
effect''), although no net thermal bias is acting. Moreover, we find that the
relative phase between the two harmonics in scenario (ii) enables steering the
net heat current into a direction of choice.

estimated. This prevents accurate assessment of the communication performance
by naively using a previously developed analytical scheme based on a matrix
integration formula. In order to resolve this difficulty, we develop a
formalism that can formally handle the correlations in Kronecker models based
on the known scheme. Unfortunately, direct application of the developed scheme
is, in general, practically difficult. However, the formalism is still useful,
indicating that the effect of the correlations generally increase after the
fourth order with respect to correlation strength. Therefore, the known
analytical scheme offers a good approximation in performance evaluation when
the correlation strength is sufficiently small. For a class of specific
correlation, we show that the performance analysis can be mapped to the problem
of one-dimensional spin systems in random fields, which can be investigated
without approximation by the belief propagation algorithm.

central star. A sample of 20 Class 0 and I protostars has been observed in
continuum at (sub)millimeter wavelengths at high angular resolution with the
Submillimeter Array. Using detailed dust radiative transfer models, we have
developed a framework for disentangling the continuum emission from the
envelopes and disks, and from that estimated their masses. For the Class I
sources in the sample, HCO+ 3-2 line emission has furthermore been observed
with the Submillimeter Array. Four of these sources show signs of Keplerian
rotation, constraining the masses of the central stars. Both Class 0 and I
protostars are surrounded by disks with typical masses of about 0.05 M_sun. No
evidence is found for a correlation between the disk mass and evolutionary
stage of the young stellar objects. This contrasts the envelope mass, which
decreases sharply from 1 M_sun in the Class 0 stage to <0.1 M_sun in the Class
I stage. Typically, the disks have masses that are 1-10% of the corresponding
envelope masses in the Class 0 stage and 20-60% in the Class I stage. For the
Class I sources for which Keplerian rotation is seen, the central stars contain
70-98% of the total mass in the star-disk-envelope system, confirming that
these objects are late in their evolution through the embedded protostellar
stages. Theoretical models tend to overestimate the disk masses relative to the
stellar masses in the late Class I stage. The results argue in favor of a
picture in which circumstellar disks are formed early during the protostellar
evolution and rapidly process material accreted from the larger scale envelope
onto the central star.

show that the distribution of such undesirable accuracy parameters is closely

asymptotic occurrence rate of these patterns is bounded in terms of the
asymptotic occurrence rate of zeroes. We also present examples of infinite

the medium is important to decrease spatial scale of such nonlinear effects as
pulse compression, though it does not provide any fundamentally new phenomena
as compared to dilute media. Frequency detuning decreases the effectivity of
such nonlinear phenomena as pulse compression and dispersion spreading
compensation as well. We propose simple logic gates based on interaction
between two pulses in one-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystal. It turned
out, that frequency detuning is necessary to obtain ultrafast AND gate, while
OR and NOT gates can be realized in the system without detuning.

I) X-ray bursts. We find bursts with a wide variety of characteristics in
serendipitous wide-field X-ray observations by EURECA/WATCH, RXTE/ASM,
BeppoSAX/WFC, HETE-2/FREGATE, INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI, and Swift/BAT, as well as
pointed observations by RXTE/PCA and HEXTE. Most of them reach a peak flux of
~15 Crab, but a few only reach a peak flux below a Crab. One of the bursts
shows a very strong photospheric radius-expansion phase. This allows us to
evaluate the distance to the source: 3.2 kpc. The burst durations are between
10 sec to 5 min. However, after one of the intermediate-duration bursts, a
faint tail is seen to at least ~2.4 hours after the start of the burst. One
very long burst lasted for several hours. This superburst candidate was
followed by a normal type-I burst only 19 days later. This is, to our
knowledge, the shortest burst-quench time among the superbursters. A superburst
in this system is difficult to reconcile if it accretes at ~1% L_Edd. The
intermediate-duration bursts occurred when 4U 0614+091's persistent emission
was lowest and calm, and when bursts were infrequent (on average one every
month to 3 months). The average burst rate increased significantly after this
period. The maximum average burst recurrence rate is once every week to 2
weeks. The burst behaviour may be partly understood if there is at least an
appreciable amount of helium present in the accreted material from the donor
star. If the system is an ultra-compact X-ray binary with a CO white-dwarf
donor, as has been suggested, this is unexpected. If the bursts are powered by
helium, we find that the energy production per accumulated mass is about 2.5
times less than expected for pure helium matter.

function f on n bits. We study the quantum and classical communication
complexity of XOR functions. In the case of exact protocols, we completely
characterise one-way communication complexity for all f. We also show that,
when f is monotone, g's quantum and classical complexities are quadratically
related, and that when f is a linear threshold function, g's quantum complexity
is Theta(n). More generally, we make a structural conjecture about the Fourier
spectra of boolean functions which, if true, would imply that the quantum and
classical exact communication complexities of all XOR functions are
asymptotically equivalent. We give two randomised classical protocols for
general XOR functions which are efficient for certain functions, and a third
protocol for linear threshold functions with high margin. These protocols
operate in the symmetric message passing model with shared randomness.

changes this picture dramatically. High Strehl Ratios require what is currently

first order simulations show that the performance of such a system drops
significantly when not taking into account refractivity effects and atmospheric

ecosystems, which are considered to be robust, self-organising and scalable
architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. So, this
work is concerned with the creation, investigation, and optimisation of Digital
Ecosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems.
First, we created the Digital Ecosystem, a novel optimisation technique
inspired by biological ecosystems, where the optimisation works at two levels:
a first optimisation, migration of agents which are distributed in a
decentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this
process feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that
operates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy
locally relevant constraints. We then investigated its self-organising aspects,
starting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include
evolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent
populations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent
stability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity
of the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we
considered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital
Ecosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the
evolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted
migration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent
optimisation of the agent migration patterns. Overall, we have advanced the
understanding of creating Digital Ecosystems, the self-organisation that occurs
within them, and the optimisation of their Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture.

photometrically but not spectroscopically. For this reason we have compiled a
set of spectroscopic data to determine the absolute and atmospheric parameters
of the components. We determined the radial velocities (RV) of both components
using four different techniques. We disentangled the binary spectra using
KOREL, and performed the first abundance analysis on both disentangled spectra.
By combining the spectroscopic results and the photometric data, we obtained
the component masses, 1.8 and 1.7 solar masses, and radii, 4.0 and 2.4 solar
radii, for inclination i = 73.2 degrees, eccentricity e = 0.28, and orbital
period 5.70198 days. Effective temperatures of 7600 K and 8100 K were also
determined. The measured vsini are 78 and 74 km/s, respectively, giving
rotational periods of 2.50 and 1.55 days for the components. The abundance
analysis shows [Fe/H] = -0.28 for the primary (pulsating) star, consistent with
observations of IC4756. We also present an assessment of the different analysis

law models give a good description in the X-ray domain (mean photon index ~
2.05) and MeV domain (photon index ~ 2.23), crucial information are contained
in the evolution of the slope with energy between these two values. This study
has been carried out trough individual observations and long duration (~ 400
ks) averaged spectra. The stability of the emission is remarkable and excludes
a single power law model. The slopes measured below and above 100 keV agree
perfectly with the last values reported in the X-ray and MeV regions
respectively, but without indication of a localized break point. This suggests
a gradual softening in the emission around 100 keV and thus a continuous
evolution rather than an actual change in the mechanism parameters. In the MeV
region, no significant deviation from the proposed power law model is visible
up to 5-6 MeV. Finally, we take advantage of the spectroscopic capability of
the instrument to seek for previously reported spectral features in the covered
energy range with negative results for any significant cyclotron or
annihilation emission on 400 ks timescales. Beyond the scientific results, the
performance and reliability of the SPI instrument is explicitly demonstrated,

encoding higher correlations in cases where the option is particularly
sensitive to stress scenarios of the market. As a result, more complex
dependency structures emerge than the ones described by Gaussian copulas or

nucleosynthesis during their thermal pulsing phase. The theoretical predictions
obtained by AGB models at different masses, s-process efficiencies, dilution
factors and initial r-enrichment, are compared with spectroscopic observations
of Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor stars enriched in s-process elements, CEMP(s),
collected from the literature. We discuss here five stars as example, CS
22880-074, CS 22942-019, CS 29526-110, HE 0202-2204, and LP 625-44. All these
objects lie on the main-sequence or on the giant phase, clearly before the
TP-AGB stage: the hypothesis of mass transfer from an AGB companion, would
explain the observed s-process enhancement. CS 29526-110 and LP 625-44 are
CEMP(s+r) objects, and are interpreted assuming that the molecular cloud, from
which the binary system formed, was already enriched in r-process elements by
SNII pollution. In several cases, the observed s-process distribution may be
accounted for AGB models of different initial masses with proper 13C-pocket
efficiency and dilution factor. Na (and Mg), produced via the neutron capture
chain starting from 22Ne, may provide an indicator of the initial AGB mass.

conclusions can be summarized as follows: the Spectral Energy Distributions of
all sources include both AGN and starburst contributions; the AGN contribution
to the bolometric luminosities ranges between 14 and 26% of the total. Such a
contribution is enough for the AGN to dominate the emission at 5.8, 8 and 24um,

macroscopic evolution equations--describing, for example, the dynamics of an
electron gas--from the underlying fundamental microscopic laws of classical or
quantum mechanics. An iconic mathematical model in this research area is the
Lorentz gas, which describes an ensemble of non-interacting point particles in
an infinite array of spherical scatterers. In the case of a disordered
scatterer configuration, the classical results by Gallavotti, Spohn and
Boldrighini-Bunimovich-Sinai show that the time evolution of a macroscopic
particle cloud is governed, in the limit of small scatterer density
(Boltzmann-Grad limit), by the linear Boltzmann equation. In this lecture I
will discuss the recent discovery that for a periodic configuration of
scatterers the linear Boltzmann equation fails, and the random flight process
that emerges in the Boltzmann-Grad limit is substantially more complicated. The
key ingredient in the description of the limiting stochastic process is the
renormalization dynamics on the space of lattices, a powerful technique that
has recently been successfully applied also to other open problems in
mathematical physics, including KAM theory and quantum chaos. This lecture is
based on joint work with Andreas Strombergsson, Uppsala.

Concerning the interpolating function \mu(x), we extensively used the forms
\mu_1=1/(1+x),\mu_2=x/(1+x^2)^1/2,\mu_3/2=x/(1+x^3/2)^2/3. We integrated both
the MOND and the Newtonian equations of motion in Cartesian coordinates sharing
the same initial conditions. We considered both ecliptic and nearly polar
trajectories, all with high eccentricities (e>0.1). In order to evaluate the
characteristic MOND parameters \mu_g and L_g entering the problem, we used two
different values (V=220 km s^-1 and V=254 km s^-1) of the circular speed of the
solar system's motion through the Galaxy; $V$ allows to evaluate the Milky
Way's gravitational field at the Sun's location. It turns out that EFE induces
strong distortions of the Newtonian ellipses, especially in the ecliptic plane
yielding more involved paths which span less extended spatial regions.

B has a spectrum, a locale internal to T(A), the external description S(A) of

classical physics, the open subsets of S(A) correspond to (atomic)

Heyting algebra structure of S(A). The key difference between this logic and
its classical counterpart is that the former does not satisfy the law of the
excluded middle, and hence is intuitionistic. When A contains sufficiently many
projections (e.g. when A is a von Neumann algebra, or, more generally, a
Rickart C*-algebra), the intuitionistic quantum logic S(A) of A may also be
compared with the traditional quantum logic, i.e. the orthomodular lattice of
projections in A. This time, the main difference is that the former is
distributive (even when A is noncommutative), while the latter is not.
