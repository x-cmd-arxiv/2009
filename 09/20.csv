incorporate these additional contributions to the covariance of a binned
angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies in the analysis of current

are not particularly sensitive to these additional non-Gaussian effects, the
interpretation of Planck and CMBPol anisotropy spectra will require an
accounting of non-Gaussian covariance leading to a degradation in cosmological
parameter estimates by up to 20% and 30%, respectively.

base learners. It is well-known that to construct a good ensemble, the base
learners should be accurate as well as diverse. In this paper, unlabeled data
is exploited to facilitate ensemble learning by helping augment the diversity
among the base learners. Specifically, a semi-supervised ensemble method named
UDEED is proposed. Unlike existing semi-supervised ensemble methods where
error-prone pseudo-labels are estimated for unlabeled data to enlarge the
labeled data to improve accuracy, UDEED works by maximizing accuracies of base
learners on labeled data while maximizing diversity among them on unlabeled
data. Experiments show that UDEED can effectively utilize unlabeled data for
ensemble learning and is highly competitive to well-established semi-supervised
ensemble methods.

were obtained using the CHAMP+ 650/850 GHz heterodyne array receiver on APEX.
Surprisingly strong quiescent extended narrow-line high-J 12CO 6-5 and 7-6
emission is seen toward all protostars, suggesting that heating by UV photons
along the outflow cavity dominates the emission. At the source position itself,
passive heating of the collapsing inner envelope by the luminosity of the
source also contributes. The UV photons are generally not energetic enough to
dissociate CO since the [C I] 2-1 emission, also probed by our data, is weak
except at the bow shock at the tip of the outflow. The extended UV radiation is
produced by the star-disk boundary layer as well as the jet- and bow-shocks,
and will also affect the chemistry of species such as H2O and HCN around the
outflow axis. Shock-heated warm gas characterized by broad CO line profiles is
seen only toward the more massive Class 0 outflows. Outflow temperatures,
estimated from the CO 6-5/3-2 line wing ratios, are ~100 K. These data
illustrate the importance of getting spatial information to characterize the
physical processes in YSO surroundings, important to interpret future Herschel

frequently reported. These oscillations have the common features of being of
short period (2-10 min) and being damped after a few periods. Kink
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes have been proposed as responsible for the
observed oscillations, whereas resonant absorption in the Alfven continuum and
ion-neutral collisions are the best candidates to be the damping mechanisms.
Here, we study both analytically and numerically the time damping of kink MHD
waves in a cylindrical, partially ionized filament thread embedded in a coronal
environment. The thread model is composed of a straight and thin, homogeneous
filament plasma, with a transverse inhomogeneous transitional layer where the
plasma physical properties vary continuously from filament to coronal
conditions. The magnetic field is homogeneous and parallel to the thread axis.
We find that the kink mode is efficiently damped by resonant absorption for
typical wavelengths of filament oscillations, the damping times being
compatible with the observations. Partial ionization does not affect the
process of resonant absorption, and the filament plasma ionization degree is
only important for the damping for wavelengths much shorter than those
observed. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the phenomenon of
resonant absorption is studied in a partially ionized plasma.

footage over the past decade. This has necessitated the development of new
techniques in computer vision geared towards efficient analysis, storage and
retrieval of such data. Many mid-level computer vision tasks such as
segmentation, object detection, tracking, etc. involve an inference problem
based on the video data available. Video data has a high degree of spatial and
temporal coherence. The property must be intelligently leveraged in order to
obtain better results.
  Graphical models, such as Markov Random Fields, have emerged as a powerful
tool for such inference problems. They are naturally suited for expressing the
spatial dependencies present in video data, It is however, not clear, how to
extend the existing techniques for the problem of inference over time. This
thesis explores the Path Probability Method, a variational technique in
statistical mechanics, in the context of graphical models and approximate
inference problems. It extends the method to a general framework for problems
involving inference in time, resulting in an algorithm, \emph{DynBP}. We
explore the relation of the algorithm with existing techniques, and find the
algorithm competitive with existing approaches.
  The main contribution of this thesis are the extended GBP algorithm, the
extension of Path Probability Methods to the DynBP algorithm and the
relationship between them. We have also explored some applications in computer
vision involving temporal evolution with promising results.

generated by anisotropic neutrino emission in supernova cores. To calculate the
gravitational waveforms, we derive analytic formulae in a useful form, which
are applicable also for three-dimensional computations. Pushed by evidence of
slow rotation prior to core-collapse, we focus on asphericities in neutrino
emission and matter motions outside the protoneutron star. Based on the
two-dimensional (2D) models, which mimic SASI-aided neutrino heating
explosions, we compute the neutrino anisotropies via the ray-tracing method in
a post-processing manner and calculate the resulting waveforms. With these
computations, it is found that the waveforms exhibit more variety in contrast
to the ones previously estimated by the ray-by-ray analysis (e.g., Kotake et
al. (2007)). In addition to a positively growing feature, which was predicted
to determine the total wave amplitudes predominantly, the waveforms are shown
to exhibit large negative growth for some epochs during the growth of SASI.
These features are found to stem from the excess of neutrino emission in
lateral directions, which can be precisely captured by the ray-tracing
calculation. Due to the negative contributions and the neutrino absorptions
appropriately taken into account by the ray-tracing method, the wave amplitudes
become more than one-order-of magnitude smaller than the previous estimation,
thus making their detections very hard for a galactic source.On the other hand,
it is pointed out that the GW spectrum from matter motions have its peak near
$\sim 100$ Hz, which could be characteristic for the SASI-induced supernova
explosions.(abridged)

the presence of salt, the electrostatic blob size depends on the ionic strength

conservation laws with source terms are studied. The basic approach is to
investigate the stability of a non-linear scheme in terms of its cor-
responding scheme in variations. Such an approach leads to application of the
stability theory for linear equation systems to establish stability of the
corresponding non-linear scheme. It is established the notion that a non-linear
scheme is stable if and only if the corresponding scheme in variations is
stable. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF) scheme is
developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise cubic
interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate approximation
for the model in question. The stability of the modified scheme are
investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are tested on several
conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and robust. As
applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff source terms,
it is constructed a second order nonstaggered central scheme based on
operator-splitting techniques.

gravity theories, we investigate models based on GUP and one extra dimension,
compactified with radius $\rho$. We obtain an inspiring relation
$\sqrt{\beta_0} \ell_p/\rho \sim {\cal O}(1)$. This relation is also consistent
with predictions at Planck scale and usual quantum mechanics scale. We also
make estimations on the application range of the GUP model. It turns out that
the minimum measurable length is exactly the compactification radius of the
extra dimension.

Interferometer Space Antenna}}, a space-based gravitational-wave observatory.
For the first time, we consistently compute the generation of gravitational
waves from extreme-mass ratio inspirals (stellar compact objects into
supermassive black holes) in a well-motivated alternative theory of gravity,
that to date remains weakly constrained by double binary pulsar observations.
The theory we concentrate on is Chern-Simons (CS) modified gravity, a 4-D,
effective theory that is motivated both from string theory and loop-quantum
gravity, and which enhances the Einstein-Hilbert action through the addition of
a dynamical scalar field and the parity-violating Pontryagin density. We show
that although point particles continue to follow geodesics in the modified
theory, the background about which they inspiral is a modification to the Kerr
metric, which imprints a CS correction on the gravitational waves emitted. CS
modified gravitational waves are sufficiently different from the General
Relativistic expectation that they lead to significant dephasing after 3 weeks
of evolution, but such dephasing will probably not prevent detection of these
signals, but instead lead to a systematic error in the determination of
parameters. We end with a study of radiation-reaction in the modified theory
and show that, to leading-order, energy-momentum emission is not CS modified,
except possibly for the subdominant effect of scalar-field emission. The
inclusion of radiation-reaction will allow for tests of CS modified gravity
with space-borne detectors that might be two orders of magnitude larger than
current binary pulsar bounds.
