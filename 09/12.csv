Neptune's, including the transiting planets GJ436b and HAT-P-11b. Planets in
this mass-range are different from their more massive cousins in several ways
that are relevant to their radiative properties and thermal structures. By
analogy with Neptune and Uranus, they are likely to have metal abundances that
are an order of magnitude or more greater than those of larger, more massive
planets. This increases their opacity, decreases Rayleigh scattering, and
changes their equation of state. Furthermore, their smaller radii mean that
fluxes from these planets are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of
otherwise identical gas giant planets. Here, we compute a range of plausible
radiative equilibrium models of GJ436b and HAT-P-11b. In addition, we explore
the dependence of generic Neptune-mass planets on a range of physical
properties, including their distance from their host stars, their metallicity,
the spectral type of their stars, the redistribution of heat in their
atmospheres, and the possible presence of additional optical opacity in their
upper atmospheres.

disks undergoing pairwise encounters was investigated. High resolution allowed
the use of realistic initial disk models where both the vertical structure and
the local Jeans mass were resolved. The results show that objects with masses
ranging from giant planets to low mass stars can form during such encounters
from initially stable disks. The parameter space of initial spin-orbit
orientations and the azimuthal angles for each disk was explored. An upper
limit on the initial Toomre Q value of ~2 was found for fragmentation to occur.
Depending on the initial configuration, shocks, tidal-tail structures and mass
inflows were responsible for the condensation of disk gas. Retrograde disks
were generally more likely to fragment. When the interaction timescale was
significantly shorter than the disks' dynamical timescales, the proto-stellar
disks tended to be truncated without forming objects.
  The newly-formed objects had masses ranging from 0.9 to 127 Jupiter masses,
with the majority in the BD regime. They often resided in star-BD multiples and
in some cases also formed hierarchical orbiting systems. Most of them had large
angular momenta and highly flattened, disk-like shapes. The objects had radii
ranging from 0.1 to 10 AU. The disk gas was assumed to be locally isothermal,
appropriate for the short cooling times in extended proto-stellar disks, but
not for condensed objects. An additional case with explicit cooling that
reduced to zero for optically thick gas was simulated to test the extremes of
cooling effectiveness and it was still possible to form objects in this case.
Detailed radiative transfer is expected to lengthen the internal evolution
timescale for these objects, but not to alter our basic results.

the probabilistic equivalent of the classic Area-Delay product. Our error

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the area of an optimized quantum

evaluation shows that quantum carry-lookahead adders (QCLA) beat ripple-carry
adders in ADCR, despite being larger and more complex. We conclude with what we

that propagate vertically through the stratified solar atmosphere affect
different wavelengths at different times. This leads to a characteristic
pattern of (non-)coherence of the intensity at various wavelengths. We derived
the correlation matrices for several photospheric and chromospheric spectral
lines from observations. For comparison with the observations, we calculate
correlation matrices for spectra from LTE modeling approaches, 1-D NLTE
simulations, and a 3-D MHD simulation run. We apply the correlation method also
to temperature maps at different optical depth layers. We find that all
photospheric spectral lines show a similar pattern: a pronounced asymmetry of
the correlation between line core and red or blue wing. The pattern cannot be
reproduced with a simulation of the granulation pattern, but with waves that
travel upwards. All chromospheric spectral lines show a more complex pattern.
In the case of Ca II H, the 1-D NLTE simulations of monochromatic waves produce
a correlation matrix that qualitatively matches to the observations. The
photospheric signature is well reproduced in the matrix derived from the 3-D
MHD simulation. The correlation matrices of observed photospheric and
chromospheric spectral lines are highly structured with characteristic and
different patterns in every spectral line. The comparison with matrices derived
from simulations and simple modeling suggests that the main driver of the
detected patterns are upwards propagating waves. Application of the correlation
method to 3-D temperature cubes seems to be a promising tool for a detailed
comparison of simulation results and observations in future studies.

the density distribution of a collisional disk containing planets in 3

preliminary models of disks with resonant ring structures caused by terrestrial
mass planets show that the collision rate for background particles in a ring
structure is enhanced by a factor of a few compared to the rest of the disk,
and that dust grains in or near resonance have even higher collision rates. We
show how collisions can alter the morphology of a resonant ring structure by
reducing the sharpness of a resonant ring's inner edge and by smearing out
azimuthal structure. We implement a simple prescription for particle
fragmentation and show how Poynting-Robertson drag and fragmentation sort
particles by size, producing smaller dust grains at smaller circumstellar
distances. This mechanism could cause a disk to look different at different
wavelengths, and may explain the warm component of dust interior to Fomalhaut's
outer dust ring seen in the resolved 24 micron Spitzer image of this system.

between the known null hypothesis distribution and some other unknown
distribution, Hoeffding proposed a universal test in the nineteen sixties.
Hoeffding's universal test statistic can be written in terms of
Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the empirical distribution of the
observations and the null hypothesis distribution. In this paper a modification
of Hoeffding's test is considered based on a relaxation of the K-L divergence
test statistic, referred to as the mismatched divergence. The resulting
mismatched test is shown to be a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for
the case where the alternate distribution lies in a parametric family of the
distributions characterized by a finite dimensional parameter, i.e., it is a
solution to the corresponding composite hypothesis testing problem. For certain
choices of the alternate distribution, it is shown that both the Hoeffding test
and the mismatched test have the same asymptotic performance in terms of error
exponents. A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in
differentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family.
It is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the
Hoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance. This advantage is
due to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics
under the null hypothesis. In particular, the variance of the K-L divergence
grows linearly with the alphabet size, making the test impractical for
applications involving large alphabet distributions. The variance of the
mismatched divergence on the other hand grows linearly with the dimension of
the parameter space, and can hence be controlled through a prudent choice of
the function class defining the mismatched divergence.

combining Hinode/XRT observations of a small dynamic limb event, which occurred
beside a non-erupting prominence cavity, with a 3D zero-beta MHD simulation. To
this end, we model the boundary-driven kinematic emergence of a compact,
intense, and uniformly twisted flux tube into a potential field arcade that
overlies a weakly twisted coronal flux rope. The expansion of the emerging flux
in the corona gives rise to the formation of a nullpoint at the interface of
the emerging and the pre-existing fields. We unveil a two-step reconnection
process at the nullpoint that eventually yields the formation of a broad 3D
fan-spine configuration above the emerging bipole. The first reconnection
involves emerging fields and a set of large-scale arcade field lines. It
results in the launch of a torsional MHD wave that propagates along the
arcades, and in the formation of a sheared loop system on one side of the
emerging flux. The second reconnection occurs between these newly formed loops
and remote arcade fields, and yields the formation of a second loop system on
the opposite side of the emerging flux. The two loop systems collectively
display an anenome pattern that is located below the fan surface. The flux that
surrounds the inner spine field line of the nullpoint retains a fraction of the
emerged twist, while the remaining twist is evacuated along the reconnected
arcades. The nature and timing of the features which occur in the simulation do
qualititatively reproduce those observed by XRT in the particular event studied
in this paper. Moreover, the two-step reconnection process suggests a new
consistent and generic model for the formation of anemone regions in the solar

been a non-vanishing chiral condensate $\Sigma$ in the chiral limit. Here we
consider the 2-flavour Schwinger model, where this assumption does not hold. We
simulated this model with dynamical overlap hypercube fermions, and entered
terra incognita by analysing this Dirac spectrum. The usual RMT prediction for
the unfolded level spacing distribution in a unitary ensemble is precisely

correspond to a scale-invariant parameter $\propto \lambda V^{3/4}$, which is,
however, incompatible with our data. Instead we observe to high precision a

being converted to stars, is considerably longer than typical dynamical
timescales associated with a galactic disk. For purposes of modeling galaxy
evolution, however, it would be extremely attractive if the star formation
timescale were proportional to an easily derived dynamical timescale. We
compare estimates of the star formation timescale within nearby galaxies, based
on the work of Leroy et al. (2008) and existing BIMA SONG CO data, with three
simple forms of the dynamical time: the orbital time, the free-fall time at the
midplane density, and the disk Jeans time (the growth time for gravitational
instabilities in a disk). When taking into account the gravity of the stellar
disk in an approximate way, all three timescales show correlations with the
star formation timescale, though none of the correlations can be accurately
described as linear. Systematic errors in estimating appropriate gas masses and
the stellar velocity dispersion may obscure an underlying correlation, but we
focus instead on a model where the timescale for H_2 formation from HI is
decoupled from the timescale for star formation from H_2. The Jeans time
correlates well with the first of these timescales, but the relationship is
still non-linear, and requires a characteristic GMC lifetime that increases
toward galaxy centers.

research topics in modern extragalactic astronomy: the growth of structure and
its influence on galaxy formation. Only with the advent of the Chandra and XMM
facilities have X-ray observations reached the depths required to address these
questions in a satisfactory manner. Here we present an X-ray imaging study of
two patches from the CNOC2 spectroscopic galaxy survey using combined Chandra
and XMM data. A state of the art extended source finding algorithm has been
applied, and the resultant source catalog, including redshifts from a
spectroscopic follow-up program, is presented. The total number of
spectroscopically identified groups is 25 spanning a redshift range 0.04-0.79.
Approximately 50% of CNOC2 spectroscopically selected groups in the deeper
X-ray (RA14h) field are likely X-ray detections, compared to 20% in the
shallower (RA21h) field. Statistical modeling shows that this is consistent
with expectations, assuming an expected evolution of the Lx-M relation. A
significant detection of a stacked shear signal for both spectroscopic and
X-ray groups indicates that both samples contain real groups of about the
expected mass. We conclude that the current area and depth of X-ray and
spectroscopic facilities provide a unique window of opportunity at z~0.4 to
test the X-ray appearance of galaxy groups selected in various ways. There is
at present no evidence that the correlation between X-ray luminosity and
velocity dispersion evolves significantly with redshift, which implies that
catalogs based on either method can be fairly compared and modeled.

the disorder dominated superconductor-insulator transition, described in terms
of the dirty boson model. Analyzing the spectral properties of the interacting
bosons in the absence of phonons, we argue that the Bose glass phase admits
three distinct regimes. For strongest disorder the boson system is a fully
localized, perfect insulator at any temperature. At smaller disorder, only the
low temperature phase exhibits perfect insulation while delocalization takes
place above a finite temperature. We argue that a third phase must intervene
between these perfect insulators and the superconductor. This conducting Bose
glass phase is characterized by a mobility edge in the many body spectrum,
located at finite energy above the ground state. In this insulating regime
purely electronically activated transport occurs, with a conductivity following
an Arrhenius law at asymptotically low temperatures, while a tendency to
superactivation is predicted at higher T. These predictions are in good
agreement with recent transport experiments in highly disordered films of
superconducting materials.

determine the origin of chaos observed in recent experiments. Networks with
nodes consisting of ideal logic gates are known to display either steady
states, periodic behavior, or an ultraviolet catastrophe where the number of
logic-transition events circulating in the network per unit time grows as a
power-law. In an experiment, non-ideal behavior of the logic gates prevents the
ultraviolet catastrophe and may lead to deterministic chaos. We identify
certain non-ideal features of real logic gates that enable chaos in
experimental networks. We find that short-pulse rejection and the asymmetry
between the logic states tends to engender periodic behavior, at least for the
simplest networks. On the other hand, we find that a memory effect termed
""degradation"" can generate chaos. Our results strongly suggest that
deterministic chaos can be expected in a large class of experimental
Boolean-like networks. Such devices may find application in a variety of
technologies requiring fast complex waveforms or flat power spectra, and can be

all homomorphisms of root systems come from homomorphisms of their bases. Since
the Dynkin diagram of R is, in general, not large enough to contain the

this paper we introduce a canonical enlargement of a basis (called an enhanced

enhanced Dynkin diagram for a diagram representing an enhanced basis. These
diagrams in combination with other new tools (mosets, core groups) allow to
obtain a transparent picture of the natural partial order between Weyl orbits

have been designed for privacy preserving microdata publishing. Recent work has
shown that generalization loses considerable amount of information, especially
for high-dimensional data. Bucketization, on the other hand, does not prevent
membership disclosure and does not apply for data that do not have a clear
separation between quasi-identifying attributes and sensitive attributes.
  In this paper, we present a novel technique called slicing, which partitions
the data both horizontally and vertically. We show that slicing preserves
better data utility than generalization and can be used for membership
disclosure protection. Another important advantage of slicing is that it can
handle high-dimensional data. We show how slicing can be used for attribute
disclosure protection and develop an efficient algorithm for computing the
sliced data that obey the l-diversity requirement. Our workload experiments
confirm that slicing preserves better utility than generalization and is more
effective than bucketization in workloads involving the sensitive attribute.
Our experiments also demonstrate that slicing can be used to prevent membership

B2/B3 on the main sequence. About 8120 spectra of 4437 stars were searched for
emission lines in 84 open clusters. 370 emission-line stars were found, among
them at least 231 near the main sequence. For 176 of them, photometry could be
found in the OGLE database. For comparison with a higher-metallicity
environment, the Galactic sample of the photometric Halpha survey by McSwain &
Gies (2005) was used. Among early spectral sub-types, Be stars are more
frequent by a factor 3-5 in the SMC than in the Galaxy. The distribution with
spectral type is similar in both galaxies, i.e. not strongly dependent on
metallicity. The fraction of Be stars does not seem to vary with local star
density. The Be phenomenon mainly sets in towards the end of the main-sequence
evolution (this trend may be more pronounced in the SMC); but some Be stars
already form with Be-star characteristics. In all probability, the fractional
critical angular rotation rate, \omc, is one of the main parameters governing
the occurrence of the Be phenomenon. If the Be character is only acquired
during the course of evolution, the key circumstance is the evolution of \omc,
which not only is dependent on metallicity but differently so for different
mass ranges.

into two parts. One has no contribution to the net momentum due to the
transversality condition. The other yields all the momentum. The angular
momentum that is associated with the former part is spin, and the angular
momentum that is associated with the latter part is orbital angular momentum.
Expressions for the spin and orbital angular momentum are given in terms of the
electric vector in reciprocal space. The spin and orbital angular momentum
defined this way are used to investigate the angular momentum of nonparaxial
beams that are described in a recently published paper [Phys. Rev. A 78, 063831
(2008)]. It is found that the orbital angular momentum depends, apart from an
$l$-dependent term, on two global quantities, the polarization represented by a
generalized Jones vector and a new characteristic represented by a unit vector
$\mathbf{I}$, though the spin depends only on the polarization. The
polarization dependence of orbital angular momentum through the impact of
$\mathbf{I}$ is obtained and discussed. Some applications of the result
obtained here are also made. The fact that the spin originates from the
momentum density that has no contribution to the net momentum is used to show
that there does not exist the paradox on the spin of circularly polarized plane
wave. The polarization dependence of both spin and orbital angular momentum is
shown to be the origin of conversion from the spin of a paraxial
Laguerre-Gaussian beam into the orbital angular momentum of the focused beam
through a high numerical aperture.

these tests is to provide additional information on whether the 3D model is
suitable to derive the solar oxygen abundance. We also aim to empirically
constrain the NLTE recipes for neutral hydrogen collisions, using the
spatially-resolved observations of the OI 777 nm lines. Methods: using the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope we obtained high-spatial-resolution observations of
five atomic oxygen lines (along with lines for other species) for five
positions on the solar disk. These observations have a high spatial and
spectral resolution, and a continuum intensity contrast up to 9% at 615 nm. The
theoretical line profiles were computed using the 3D model, with a full 3D NLTE
treatment for oxygen and LTE for the other lines. Results: at disk-centre we
find an excellent agreement between predicted and observed line shifts,
strengths, FWHM and asymmetries. At other viewing angles the agreement is also
good, but the smaller continuum intensity contrast makes a quantitative
comparison harder. We use the disk-centre observations we constrain S_H, the
scaling factor for the efficiency of collisions with neutral hydrogen. We find
that S_H=1 provides the best match to the observations. Conclusions: overall
there is a very good agreement between predicted and observed line properties

lines across the solar surface we seek to test if the 3D and 1D models
reproduce their observed centre-to-limb variation (CLV). In particular we seek
to assess whether the 3D model is appropriate to derive the solar oxygen

[OI] 630.03 nm and nine lines of other elements for five viewing angles
0.2<mu<1 of the quiet solar disk. We compare them with the predicted line
profiles from the 3D and 1D models computed using the most up-to-date line
formation codes, line data and allowing for departures of LTE. The CLV of the
OI 777 nm lines is also used to obtain an empirical correction for the poorly
known efficiency of the inelastic collisions with H. Results: The 3D model
generally reproduces the CLV observations of the lines very well, particularly
the oxygen lines. From the OI 777 nm lines we find that the classical Drawin
recipe slightly overestimates H collisions. The limb observations of the OI
615.82 nm line allow us to identify a previously unknown contribution of
molecules for this line, prevalent at the solar limb. A detailed treatment of
the [OI] 630.03 nm line shows that the 3D modeling provides an excellent
agreement with the observations. The derived oxygen abundances with the 3D
model are 8.68 (OI 777 nm), 8.66 ([OI] 630.03 nm) and 8.62 (OI 615.82 nm).

state regime is posed in a generalized framework, by using a variational theory
supported by well established physical principles. The equivalence between the
variational statement and more conventional treatments, based on the solution
of the differential Maxwell equations together with appropriate conductivity
laws is shown. Advantages of the variational method are emphasized, focusing on
its numerical performance, that allows to explore new physical scenarios. In
particular, we present the extension of the so-called double critical state
model to three dimensional configurations in which only flux transport
(T-states), cutting (C-states) or both mechanisms (CT-states) occur. The theory
is applied to several problems. First, we show the features of the transition
from T to CT states. Second, we give a generalized expression for the flux
cutting threshold in 3-D and show its relevance in the slab geometry. In
addition, several models that allow to treat flux depinning and cutting
mechanisms are compared. Finally, the longitudinal transport problem (current
is applied parallel to the external magnetic field) is analyzed both under T
and CT conditions. The complex interaction between shielding and transport is
solved.

investigated. With the Numerov method, our numerical results show that the
resonance states also exist in the brane besides the single-field thick branes

is related to the internal structure of the brane and the coupling of fermions
and scalars. We find that the Kaluza-Klein chiral decomposition of massive
fermion resonances is the parity-chiral decomposition. For the couplings
$\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi^{k}\chi\rho\Psi$ and $\eta\bar{\Psi}\phi^{k}\chi\rho\Psi$
for three-field and two-field models with odd positive $k$, respectively, the
number of the resonant states decreases with $k$. This result is opposite to
the one obtained in the single-field de Sitter thick brane (arXiv:0904.1785).

opportunity of reaching small enough scales (of the order of 1700 AU at 1.3 mm)
to separate individual collapsing objects. The cores are sub-fragmented with a
total of 23 fragments inside 5 cores. Only the most compact core, CygX-N63,
could actually be a single massive protostar with an envelope mass as large as
60 Msun. The fragments in the other cores have sizes and separations similar to
low-mass pre-stellar and proto-stellar condensations in nearby protoclusters,
and are probably of the same nature. A total of 9 out of these 23 protostellar
objects are found to be probable precursors of OB stars with envelope masses
ranging from 6 to 23 Msun. The level of fragmentation is globally higher than
in the turbulence regulated, monolithic collapse scenario, but is not as high
as expected in a pure gravo-turbulent scenario where the distribution of mass
is dominated by low-mass protostars/stars. Here, the fractions of the total
core masses in the high-mass fragments are reaching values as high as 28, 44,
and 100 % in CygX-N12, CygX-N53, and CygX-N63, respectively, much higher than
what an IMF-like mass distribution would predict. The increase of the
fragmentation efficiency as a function of density in the cores is proposed to
be due to the increasing importance of self-gravity leading to gravitational
collapse at the scale of the dense cores. At the same time, the cores tend to
fragment into a few massive protostars within their central regions. We are
therefore probably witnessing here the primordial mass segregation of clusters
in formation.

chromo-electric external field with a pulse-like time evolution, which
simulates the overlap of two colliding heavy ions. The calculations is
performed in a SU(2) color model with finite current quark masses. Yields of
heavy quark-pairs are compared to the ones of light and strange quark-pairs. We
show that the small inverse duration time of the field pulse determines the
efficiency of the quark-pair production. Thus we do not see the expected
suppression for heavy quark production, as follows from the Schwinger formula

ultrarelativistic energies. We convert pulse duration time-dependent results

string tensions, which can be used in string based model calculations at RHIC

quantitative evaluation of the energy transport in the various modes and for
different field strengths, as well as the effect of the boundary-layer
thickness on wave propagation. We carry out 2-D MHD numerical simulations of
magnetic flux concentrations for strong and moderate magnetic fields. Waves are
excited in the tube and ambient medium by a transverse impulsive motion of the
lower boundary. The nature of the modes excited depends on the value of beta.
Mode conversion occurs in the moderate field case when the fast mode crosses
the beta=1 contour. In the strong field case the fast mode undergoes conversion
from predominantly magnetic to predominantly acoustic when waves are leaking
from the interior of the flux concentration to the ambient medium. We also
estimate the energy fluxes in the acoustic and magnetic modes. The main
conclusions of our work are twofold: firstly, for transverse, impulsive
excitation, flux tubes/sheets with strong fields are more efficient than those
with weak fields in providing acoustic flux to the chromosphere. However, there
is insufficient energy in the acoustic flux to balance the chromospheric
radiative losses in the network, even for the strong field case. Secondly, the
acoustic emission from the interface between the flux concentration and the
ambient medium decreases with the width of the boundary layer.

that an understanding of the selection of the initial state for our universe

helps to unravel the nature of time and the reasons behind the time-reversal
symmetry of our physical laws. I make the distinction between a local emerging
arrow of time in the nucleating universe and the fundamental time with no arrow
in the multiverse. The very event of nucleation of the universe from the
multiverse breaks time-reversal symmetry, inducing a locally emergent arrow.
But, the laws of physics imprinted on this bubble are not processed at birth.
Time-reversal symmetry of laws in our universe is inherited from its birth in

Phase-sensitive third-order harmonic voltage data
$\tilde{u}_{3f}=|u_{3f}|exp(i\phi_{3f})$ are acquired with a near-field
microwave microscope on homogeneous YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) thin
films in a temperature range close to the critical temperature T$_c$. As
temperature is increased from below T$_c$, the harmonic magnitude exhibits a
maximum, while the phase, $\pi/2$ in the superconducting state, goes through a
minimum. It is found that samples with doping ranges from near optimal
($\delta=0.16$) to underdoped ($\delta=0.47$) exhibit different behavior in
terms of both the harmonic magnitude and phase. In optimally-doped samples, the
harmonic magnitude reaches its maximum at a temperature $T_M$ slightly lower
than that associated with the minimum of phase $T_m$ and drops into the
noisefloor as soon as $T_m$ is exceeded. In underdoped samples $T_M$ is shifted
toward lower temperatures with respect to $T_m$ and the harmonic voltage
magnitude decreases slower with temperature than in the case of optimally-doped
samples. A field-based analytical model of $\tilde{u}_{3f}$ is presented, where
the nonlinear behavior is introduced as corrections to the low-field,
linear-response complex conductivity. The model reproduces the low-temperature
regime where the $\sigma_2$ nonlinearity dominates, in agreement with published
theoretical and experimental results. Additionally the model identifies $T_m$
as the temperature where the order parameter relaxation time becomes comparable
to the microwave probing period and reproduces semi-quantitatively the
experimental data.

central regions of galaxy clusters and provide the most relevant example of
cluster non-thermal activity. Radio and X-ray surveys allow to investigate the
statistics of halos and may contribute to constrain their origin and evolution.
We investigate the distribution of clusters in the plane X-ray (thermal, L_X)
vs synchrotron (P_{1.4})luminosity, where clusters hosting giant radio halos
trace the P_{1.4}--L_X correlation and clusters without radio halos populate a
region that is well separated from that spanned by the above correlation. The
connection between radio halos and cluster mergers suggests that the cluster
Mpc-scale synchrotron emission is amplified during these mergers and then
suppressed when clusters become more dynamically relaxed. In this context, by
analysing the distribution in the P_{1.4}--L_X plane of clusters from X-ray
selected samples with adequate radio follow up, we constrain the typical
time-scale of evolution of diffuse radio emission in clusters and discuss the
implications for the origin of radio halos. We conclude that cluster
synchrotron emission is suppressed (and amplified) in a time-scale
significantly smaller than 1 Gyr. We show that this constraint appears
difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the halo's radio power is
suppressed due to dissipation of magnetic field in galaxy clusters. On the
other hand, in agreement with models where turbulent acceleration plays a role,
present constraints suggest that relativistic electrons are accelerated in
Mpc-scale regions, in connection with cluster mergers and for a time-interval
of about 1 Gyr, and then they cool in a relatively small time-scale, when the
hosting cluster becomes more dynamically relaxed.

multilinear algebra known as PARAFAC tensor decomposition. The proposed method
first creates labeled-link network representation of the weblog datasets, where
the nodes are the blogs and the labels are the shared words. Then, 3-way
adjacency tensor is extracted from the network and the PARAFAC decomposition is
applied to the tensor to get pairs of node lists and label lists with scores
attached to each list as the indication of the degree of importance. The
clustering is done by sorting the lists in decreasing order and taking the
pairs of top ranked blogs and words. Thus, unlike standard co-clustering
methods, this method not only groups the similar blogs with their descriptive
words but also tends to produce clusters of important blogs and descriptive
words.
