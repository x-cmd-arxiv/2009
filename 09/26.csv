years. The theorem of inclusions, proven in Ref. [1], states that the Bose
glass phase always intervenes between the Mott insulating and superfluid
phases. Here, we note that assumptions on which the theorem is based exclude
phase transitions between gapped (Mott insulator) and gapless phases (Bose
glass). The apparent paradox is resolved through a unique mechanism: such
transitions have to be of the Griffiths type when the vanishing of the gap at
the critical point is due to a zero concentration of rare regions where extreme
fluctuations of disorder mimic a {\it regular} gapless system. An exactly
solvable random transverse field Ising model in one dimension is used to
illustrate the point. A highly non-trivial overall shape of the phase diagram
is revealed with the worm algorithm. The phase diagram features a long
superfluid finger at strong disorder and on-site interaction. Moreover, bosonic
superfluidity is extremely robust against disorder in a broad range of
interaction parameters; it persists in random potentials nearly 50 (!) times
larger than the particle half-bandwidth. Finally, we comment on the feasibility
of obtaining this phase diagram in cold-atom experiments, which work with
trapped systems at finite temperature.

spatially resolved spectral data cube was used in the kinematic, morphological
and abundance analysis of the ejecta. The line maps show a very clumpy shell
with two main symmetric structures. The first one is the outer part of the
shell seen in H-alpha, that forms two rings projected in the sky plane. These
ring structures correspond to a closed hourglass shape, first proposed by
Harman and O'Brien (2003). The equatorial emission enhancement is caused by the
superimposed hourglass structures in the line of sight. The second structure
seen only in the [OIII] and [NII] maps is located along the polar directions
inside the hourglass structure. Abundances gradients between the polar caps and
equatorial region were not found. However, the outer part of the shell seems to
be less abundant in Oxygen and Nitrogen than the inner regions. Detailed 2.5D
photoionization modeling of the 3D shell was performed using the mass
distribution inferred from the observations and the presence of mass clumps.
The resulting model grids are used to constrain the physical properties of the
shell as well as the central ionizing source. A sequence of 3D clumpy models
including a disk shaped ionization source is able to reproduce the ionization
gradients between polar and equatorial regions of the shell. Differences
between shell axial ratios in different lines can also be explained by
aspherical illumination. A total shell mass of 9 x 10-4 Msun is derived from
these models. We estimate that 50% to 70% of the shell mass is contained in
neutral clumps with density contrast up to a factor of 30.

Telescope observations of AR 10942 coupled with magnetic modeling, we
demonstrate that the outflows originate from specific locations of the magnetic

separatrices. We found the strongest AR outflows to be in the vicinity of QSL
sections located over areas of strong magnetic field. We argue that magnetic
reconnection at QSLs separating closed field lines of the AR and either
large-scale externally connected or `open' field lines is a viable mechanism
for driving AR outflows which are likely sources of the slow solar wind.

star complexes, which, in turn, are located inside the gas and dust lane. In
contrast, the southwestern arm of M31 splits into a gas and dust lane upstream
and a dense stellar arm downstream, with HII regions located mostly along the

southwestern arm is much higher than in the northwestern arm, and the former is
not fragmented into star complexes. The age gradient across this arm have been
found in earlier observations. According the classical SDW theory, these
drastic differences may be due due to their different pitch angles: about 0
degree for northwestern part of the arm and about 30 degree for the
southwestern segment. Data on M31, M51, M74, and some other galaxies suggest
that star complexes are mostly located in the arm segments that are not
accompanied by a dust lane upstream, i.e. do not host spiral shock wave. The
regularities in the distribution of complexes along a density wave spiral arm

using data recorded by the spectropolarimeter of the solar optical telescope
onboard Hinode. To this end we computed maps of apparent Doppler velocities by
comparing the spectral position of the Fe I 630.15 nm & Fe I 630.25 nm lines
with the averaged line profiles of the quiet Sun. To visualize the flow pattern
in the low photosphere, we used a bisector of the wing of the absorption lines.
Due to the small heliocentric angle (3 < Theta < 9) of our data sets, the
horizontal component of the Evershed flow (EF) does not contribute
significantly to the line shift. We found that in the quiet Sun (QS), the area
showing up-flows is always larger than the one exhibiting down-flows. In the
penumbra, up-flows dominate only at low velocities |v_dop| < 0.4 km/s while at
larger velocities |v_dop| > 0.6 km/s down-flows prevail. Additionally, the
maximal up-flow velocity in penumbrae is smaller, while the maximal down-flow
velocity is larger with respect to the QS velocities. Furthermore, on a spatial
average, the penumbra shows a red-shift, corresponding to a down-flow of more
than 0.1 km/s. Up-flows are elongated and appear predominately in the inner
penumbra. Strong down-flows with velocities of up to 9 km/s are concentrated at
the penumbra-QS boundary. They are magnetized and are rather round in shape.
The inner penumbra shows an average up-flow, which turns into a mean down-flow
in the outer penumbra. The up-flow patches in the inner penumbra and the
down-flow locations in the outer penumbra could be interpreted as the sources
and the sinks of the EF. We did not find any indication of roll-type convection
within penumbral filaments.

partial transposes (PTs) of the associated 4 x 4 density matrices. But the full
implementation of the test--requiring that the determinant of the PT be
nonnegative for separability to hold--appears to be, at least presently,
computationally intractable. So, we have previously implemented--using the
auxiliary concept of a diagonal-entry-parameterized separability function
(DESF)--the weaker implied test of nonnegativity of the six 2 x 2 principal
minors of the PT. This yielded an exact upper bound on the separability
probability of 1024/(135 Pi^2) = 0.76854. Here, we extend this line of work by
requiring that the four 3 x 3 principal minors of the PT be nonnegative, giving
us an improved/reduced upper bound of 22/35 = 0.628571. Numerical
simulations--as opposed to exact symbolic calculations--indicate, on the other
hand, that the true probability is certainly less than 1/2. Our combined
analyses lead us to suggest a possible form for the true DESF, yielding a
separability probability of 29/64 = 0.453125, while the best exact lower bound

explicitly constructing a primitive that, away from the outward and inward unit

primarily concerned with its local effects on the motion of stars in galaxies
and galaxy clusters. On the other hand, the WMAP experiment has shown that the
gravitational field produced by dark matter amplifies the higher acoustic modes
of the CMBR power spectrum, more intensely than the gravitational field of
baryons. Such a wide range of experimental evidences from cosmology to local
gravity suggests the necessity of a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter
gravitational field per se, regardless of any other attributes that dark matter
may eventually possess.
  In this paper we introduce and apply Nash's theory of perturbative geometry
to the study of the dark matter gravitational field alone, in a
higher-dimensional framework. It is shown that the dark matter gravitational
perturbations in the early universe can be explained by the extrinsic curvature
of the standard cosmology. Together with the estimated presence of massive
neutrinos, such geometric perturbation is compatible not only with the observed
power spectrum in the WMAP experiment but also with the most recent data on the
accelerated expansion of the universe.
  It is possible that the same structure formation exists locally, such as in
the cases of young galaxies or in cluster collisions. In most other cases it
seems to have ceased when the extrinsic curvature becomes negligible, leading
to Einstein's equations in four dimensions. The slow motion of stars in
galaxies and the motion of plasma substructures in nearly colliding clusters
are calculated with the geodesic equation for a slowly moving object in a
gravitational field of arbitrary strength.

abruptly heated plasma (the chromospheric evaporation). Emission from plasma
ascending along loops rooted on the visible solar disk should be often
dominated, at least temporally, by a blue-shifted emission. However, there is
only a very limited number of published observations of solar flares having
spectra in which the blue-shifted component dominates the stationary one. In
this work we compare observed X-ray spectra of three solar flares recorded
during their impulsive phases and relevant synthetic spectra calculated using
one-dimensional hydro-dynamic numerical model of these flares. The main aim of
the work was to explain why numerous flares do not show blue-shifted spectra.
The synthesized BCS spectra of the flares were compared with the relevant
observed BCS spectra. We conclude that stationary component of the spectrum
should be observed almost for all flares during their early phases of
evolution. In opposite, the blue-shifted component of the spectrum could be not
detected in flares having plasma rising along the flaring loop even with high
velocity due to the geometrical dependences only. After the start of the
up-flow motion, the blue-shifted component dominate temporally the synthetic
spectra of the investigated flares at their early phases.

determine a total dynamical mass of 0.15 (+0.05,-0.03) Msun, with the
uncertainty dominated by the parallax error. Using the measured total mass and
individual luminosities, the Tucson and Lyon evolutionary models both give an
age for the system of 0.4 (+9.6, -0.2) Gyr, which is consistent with its thin
disk space motion derived from the Besancon Galactic structure model. Our mass
measurement combined with the Tucson (Lyon) evolutionary models also yields
precise effective temperatures, giving 2660+-100 K and 2640+-100K (2550+-100 K
and 2530+-100 K) for components A and B, respectively. These temperatures are
in good agreement with estimates for other M8 dwarfs (from the infrared flux
method and the M8 mass benchmark LHS 2397aA), but atmospheric model fitting of
the NIR spectrum gives hotter temperatures of 2800+-100 K for both components.
This modest discrepancy can be explained by systematic errors in the
atmospheric models or by a slight underestimate of the distance (and thus mass
and age) of the system. We also find the observed near-infrared colors and
magnitudes do not agree with those predicted by the Lyon Dusty models, given
the known mass.

data centers (a collaboration dubbed URANIA), has developed a distributed
on-line digital library which has become the dominant means by which
astronomers search, access and read their technical literature. Digital
libraries such as the NASA Astrophysics Data System permit the easy
accumulation of a new type of bibliometric measure, the number of electronic
accesses (``reads'') of individual articles. We explore various aspects of this
new measure. We examine the obsolescence function as measured by actual reads,
and show that it can be well fit by the sum of four exponentials with very
different time constants. We compare the obsolescence function as measured by
readership with the obsolescence function as measured by citations. We find
that the citation function is proportional to the sum of two of the components
of the readership function. This proves that the normative theory of citation
is true in the mean. We further examine in detail the similarities and
differences between the citation rate, the readership rate and the total
citations for individual articles, and discuss some of the causes. Using the
number of reads as a bibliometric measure for individuals, we introduce the
read-cite diagram to provide a two-dimensional view of an individual's
scientific productivity. We develop a simple model to account for an
individual's reads and cites and use it to show that the position of a person
in the read-cite diagram is a function of age, innate productivity, and work
history. We show the age biases of both reads and cites, and develop two new
bibliometric measures which have substantially less age bias than citations

gives large Doppler effects of the emitted gamma rays, with as small
contribution as possible due to the energy and angular spread of the nuclei
emitting the gamma rays. Inverse kinematics heavy-ion (HI) fusion reactions of
the type (HI,gamma), (HI, n) on proton and deuteron targets have been studied.
Target effects were investigated using the program TRIM in order to determine
the impact on the Doppler effects caused by energy and angular straggling in
the target material. The cross sections of a large number of reactions of
protons and deuterons on nuclei with mass numbers in the range A=20-100 have
been evaluated using the TALYS reaction code. The fusion-evaporation reactions,
d(V-51,n)Cr-52 and d(Cl-37,n)Ar-38 were simulated in detail using the Monte
Carlo code evapOR. The interactions in AGATA of the gamma rays emitted in these
reactions were simulated using Geant4. The energy resolution of the gamma rays
after gamma-ray tracking and Doppler correction were determined as a function
of the interaction position resolution of the germanium detectors. The
conclusion of this work is that of the two reactions d(V-51,n)Cr-52 is more
suitable for an AGATA commissioning experiment.

and Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those
measured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the
view that it is a ""universal"" feature of globular cluster systems.
  We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function
for globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today
for GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star
forming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in
the star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the
observed SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the
protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of
$0.3 \pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the
clearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a
mass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance
with luminosity of $Z \sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most
giant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good
first-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size

unicast capacity of a wireless relay network. The difficulty arises due to the
complex signal interactions induced in the network, since the wireless channel
inherently broadcasts the signals and there is interference among
transmissions. Recently, Avestimehr, Diggavi and Tse proposed a linear
deterministic model that takes into account the shared nature of wireless
channels, focusing on the signal interactions rather than the background noise.
They generalized the min-cut max-flow theorem for graphs to networks of
deterministic channels and proved that the capacity can be achieved using
information theoretical tools. They showed that the value of the minimum cut is
in this case the minimum rank of all the adjacency matrices describing
source-destination cuts.
  In this paper, we develop a polynomial time algorithm that discovers the
relay encoding strategy to achieve the min-cut value in linear deterministic

crucially uses a notion of linear independence between channels to calculate
the capacity in polynomial time. Moreover, we can achieve the capacity by using
very simple one-symbol processing at the intermediate nodes, thereby
constructively yielding finite length strategies that achieve the unicast
capacity of the linear deterministic (wireless) relay network.

hierarchy problem, we consider the Randall-Sundrum (RS) scenario under the
usual hypothesis of a bulk custodial symmetry. It is shown in detail that there
can exist large corrections to the Higgs boson Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV)
induced by mixings of the gauge bosons with their Kaluza-Klein (KK)
excitations. The connection with electroweak precision tests is developed. A
noteworthy result is that the correct treatment of the Higgs VEV leads to an
increase of the lower limit at 95% C.L. on KK masses that can reach +30% (from
usually accepted values). For a Higgs mass 120 GeV < m_h < 150 GeV, the
obtained limit [from updated precision data] on the first KK gauge boson mass
lies in the range 3.3 - 4.0 TeV. The VEV corrections also play a central role
in the corrections to the Higgs couplings. We find possibly substantial RS
corrections to the various Higgs couplings able to affect its phenomenology,
starting with a Higgs discovery at LHC more challenging than in the Standard
Model (SM). The deviations to the Higgs production/decay rates found in RS will
be testable at ILC as well as at LHC. Such RS signatures could even be used at
ILC to discriminate among several models beyond the SM. Finally, the
possibility of a light Higgs boson (m_h ~ 99 GeV) interpreting the excess at
2.3 Sigma observed at LEP2 is pointed out.

of orbits in a two-dimensional dynamical system whose orbits mimic the
evolution of the price of an asset and the excess demand for that asset. The
construction of the system is grounded upon a heterogeneous interacting agent
model for a single risky asset market. An advantage of this construction
procedure is that the resulting dynamical system becomes a macroscopic market
model which mirrors the market quantities and qualities that would typically be
taken into account solely at the microscopic level of modeling. The system's
parameters correspond to: (a) the proportion of speculators in a market; (b)
the traders' speculative trend; (c) the degree of heterogeneity of
idiosyncratic evaluations of the market agents with respect to the asset's
fundamental value; and (d) the strength of the feedback of the population
excess demand on the asset price update increment. This correspondence allows
us to employ our results in order to infer plausible causes for the emergence
of price and demand fluctuations in a real asset market.
  The employment of dynamical systems for studying evolution of stochastic
models of socio-economic phenomena is quite usual in the area of heterogeneous
interacting agent models. However, in the vast majority of the cases present in
the literature, these dynamical systems are one-dimensional. Our work is among
the few in the area that construct and study two-dimensional dynamical systems

three dimensions (smooth) and that of a sawtooth in two dimensions
(non-smooth). Physically, biological organisms (or engineered micro-swimmers)
must expend internal energy in order to produce the waves of deformation
responsible for the motion. Here we propose a physically-motivated derivation
of the optimal flagellum shape. We determine analytically and numerically the
shape of the flagellar wave which leads to the fastest swimming while
minimizing an appropriately-defined energetic expenditure. Our novel approach
is to define an energy which includes not only the work against the surrounding
fluid, but also (1) the energy stored elastically in the bending of the
flagellum, (2) the energy stored elastically in the internal sliding of the
polymeric filaments which are responsible for the generation of the bending
waves (microtubules), and (3) the viscous dissipation due to the presence of an
internal fluid. This approach regularizes the optimal sawtooth shape for
two-dimensional deformation at the expense of a small loss in hydrodynamic
efficiency. The optimal waveforms of finite-size flagella are shown to depend
upon a competition between rotational motions and bending costs, and we observe
a surprising bias towards half-integer wave-numbers. Their final hydrodynamic
efficiencies are above 6%, significantly larger than those of swimming cells,
therefore indicating available room for further biological tuning.

inspired by nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics is used. We find that the
corrections of relative order (Z alpha)^2 to the two-photon decay are given by
the zitterbewegung, the spin-orbit coupling and by relativistic corrections to
the electron mass, and by quadrupole interactions. We show that all corrections
are separately gauge-invariant with respect to a ""hybrid"" transformation from
velocity to length gauge, where the gauge transformation of the wave function

controlling their physical properties for a variety of applications. In the
present work depth-dependent interdiffusion in a Si/Fe/Si trilayer has been
studied with sub-nanometer depth resolution, using x ray standing waves. High
depth-selectivity of the present technique allows one to measure diffusion at
the two interfaces of Fe namely, Fe-on-Si and Si-on-Fe, independently, yielding
an intriguing result that Fe diffusivity at the two interfaces is not
symmetric. It is faster at the Fe-on-Si interface. While the values of
activation energy at the two interfaces are comparable, the main difference is
found in the pre-exponent factor suggesting different mechanisms of diffusion
at the two interfaces. This apparently counter-intuitive result has been
understood in terms of an asymmetric structure of the interfaces as revealed by
depth selective conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy. A difference in the
surface free energies of Fe and Si can lead to such differences in the
structure of the two interfaces.

much below claimed values. During the meeting I carefully examined new claims,
and found problems with the claimed jets' rotation. I will challenge any future
observation that will claim to detect jet rotation in YSOs that requires the
jets (and not a wind) to be launched from radii much larger than the accreting
stellar radius. I conclude that the most likely jets' launching mechanism
involves a very efficient dynamo in the inner part of the accretion disk, with
jets' launching mechanism that is similar to solar flares (coronal mass
ejection).

protocol. The importance of mobility in the Internet gets keep on increasing.
Current specification of Mobile IPv6 does not provide proper support for
reliability in the mobile network and there are other problems associated with
it. In this paper, we propose Virtual Private Network (VPN) based Home Agent
Reliability Protocol (VHAHA) as a complete system architecture and extension to
Mobile IPv6 that supports reliability and offers solutions to the security
problems that are found in Mobile IP registration part. The key features of
this protocol over other protocols are: better survivability, transparent
failure detection and recovery, reduced complexity of the system and workload,
secure data transfer and improved overall performance.

propagate through network. It has been considered as one type of computer
attack and intrusion that can do a variety of malicious activity on a computer.
This paper addresses the current trend of malware detection techniques and
identifies the significant criteria in each technique to improve malware
detection in Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Several existing techniques are
analyzing from 48 various researches and the capability criteria of malware
detection technique have been reviewed. From the analysis, a new generic
taxonomy of malware detection technique have been proposed named Hybrid Malware
Detection Technique (Hybrid MDT) which consists of Hybrid Signature and Anomaly
detection technique and Hybrid Specification based and Anomaly detection
technique to complement the weaknesses of the existing malware detection
technique in detecting known and unknown attack as well as reducing false alert
before and during the intrusion occur.

interaction (SOI) and hard-wall confining potential, in a two-dimensional
electron system, exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an exact
solution of the problem and show that the spin resolved edge states are
separated in space. The SOI generated rearrangement of the spectrum results in
a peaked behavior of the net spin current versus the Fermi energy. The
predicted oscillations of the spin current with a period, determined by the SOI
renormalized cyclotron energy, can serve as an effective tool for controlling
the spin motion in spintronic devices.

micro-electrode set below the liquid Helium) in a high finesse cavity. Two
lowest levels of the vertical motion of the electron acts as a two-level
""atom"", which could resonantly interact with the THz cavity. In the Lamb-Dicke
regime, wherein the electron's in-plane activity region is much smaller than
the wavelength of the cavity mode, the famous Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) could
be realized. By applying an additional external classical laser beam to the
electron, a driven JCM could also be implemented. With such a driven JCM
certain quantum states, e.g., coherent states and the Schrodinger cat states,
of the THz cavity field could be prepared by one-step evolution. The numerical
results show that, for the typical parameters of the cavity and electron on
liquid Helium, a strong coupling between the artificial atom and the THz cavity
could be obtained.

dominance of slope vs. noise in initial conditions, using an erosion model.
Increasing slope causes network patterns to transition from dendritic to
parallel and results in a breakdown of simple power-law scaling. This provides
an example of how natural deviations from scaling might originate. Similar
network patterns in leaves suggest such deviations may be widespread. Simple
power-law scaling in river networks may require a combination of dynamics,
initial conditions, and perturbations over time.
