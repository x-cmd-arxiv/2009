coupled to the curvature (such as the Turner-Widrow mechanism for the
production of magnetic fields during inflation, and models of vector inflation
or vector curvaton) contain ghosts. The ghosts are associated with the
longitudinal vector polarization present in these models, and are found from
studying the sign of the eigenvalues of the kinetic matrix for the physical
perturbations. Ghosts introduce two main problems: (1) they make the theories
ill-defined at the quantum level in the high energy/sub horizon regime (and
create serious problems for finding a well behaved UV completion); (2) they
create an instability already at the linearized level. This happens because the
eigenvalue corresponding to the ghost crosses zero during the cosmological
evolution. At this point the linearized equations for the perturbations become
singular (we show that this happens for all the models mentioned above). We
explicitly solve the equations in the simplest cases of a vector without vev in
a FRW geometry, and of a vector with vev plus a cosmological constant, and we
show that indeed the solutions of the linearized equations diverge when these
equations become singular.

divided into fine classes based on their morphology, colour and spectral
features. The SDSS galaxies are classified into early-type and late-type; red
and blue; passive, HII, Seyfert and LINER, which returns a total of 16 fine
classes of galaxies. The properties of galaxies in each fine class are
investigated from radio to X-ray, using 2MASS, IRAS, FIRST, NVSS, GALEX and
ROSAT data. The UV - optical - NIR colours of blue early-type galaxies (BEGs)
seem to result from the combination of old stellar population and recent star
formation (SF). Non-passive red early-type galaxies (REGs) have larger
metallicity and younger age than passive REGs, which implies that non-passive
REGs have suffered recent SF adding young and metal-rich stars to them. The
radio detection fraction of REGs strongly depends on their optical absolute
magnitudes, while that of most late-type galaxies does not, implying the
difference in their radio sources: AGN and SF. The UV - optical colours and the
radio detection fraction of passive RLGs show that they have properties similar
to REGs rather than non-passive RLGs. Dust extinction may not be a dominant
factor making RLGs red, because RLGs are detected in the mid- and far-infrared
bands less efficiently than blue late-type galaxies (BLGs). The passive BLGs
have very blue UV - optical - NIR colours, implying either recent SF quenching
or current SF in their outskirts. Including star formation rate, other
multi-wavelength properties in each fine class are investigated, and their
implication on the identity of each fine class is discussed (abridged).

medium (ISM) and young stellar objects is ~4. This difference cannot be
explained by pollution of the Sun's natal molecular cloud by 18O-rich supernova
ejecta because (1) the necessary B-star progenitors live longer than the
duration of star formation in molecular clouds; (2) the delivery of ejecta gas
is too inefficient and the amount of dust in supernova ejecta is too small
compared to the required pollution (2% of total mass or ~20% of oxygen); and
(3) the predicted amounts of concomitant short-lived radionuclides (SLRs)
conflicts with the abundances of 26Al and 41Ca in the early Solar System.
Proposals for the introduction of 18O-rich material must also be consistent
with any explanation for the origin of the observed slope-one relationship
between 17O/16O and 18O/16O in the high-temperature components of primitive
meteorites. The difference in 18O/17O ratios can be explained by enrichment of
the ISM by the 17O-rich winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, the
sequestration of comparatively 18O-rich gas from star-forming regions into
long-lived, low-mass stars, and a monotonic decrease in the 18O/17O ratio of
interstellar gas. At plausible rates of star formation and gas infall, Galactic
chemical evolution does not follow a slope-one line in an three-isotope plot,
but instead moves along a steeper trajectory towards an 17O-rich state.
Evolution of the ISM and star-forming gas by AGB winds also explains the
difference in the carbon isotope ratios of the Solar System and ISM.

challenge identifying supernova candidates largely without the use of
spectroscopy. Over the past several years, a number of supernova identification
schemes have been proposed that rely on photometric information only. Some of
these schemes use color-color or color-magnitude diagrams; others simply fit
supernova data to models. Both of these approaches suffer a number of drawbacks
partially addressed in the so-called Bayesian-based supernova classification
techniques. However, Bayesian techniques are also problematic in that they
typically require that the supernova candidate be one of a known set of
supernova types. This presents a number of problems, the most obvious of which
is that there are bound to be objects that do not conform to any presently
known model in large supernova candidate samples. We propose a new photometric
classification scheme that uses a Bayes factor based on color in order to
identify supernovae by type. This method does not require knowledge of the
complete set of possible astronomical objects that could mimic a supernova
signal. Further, as a Bayesian approach, it accounts for all systematic and
statistical uncertainties of the measurements in a single step. To illustrate
the use of the technique, we apply it to a simulated dataset for a possible
future large-scale space-based Joint Dark Energy Mission and demonstrate how it
could be used to identify Type Ia supernovae. The method's utility in
pre-selecting and ranking supernova candidates for possible spectroscopic
follow-up -- i.e., its usage as a supernova trigger -- will be briefly
discussed.

relies (directly) on a pseudorandom generator in a way that provides linear
improvement in the number of applications of the underlying one-way permutation

relied on the algebraic properties of Boolean logic. Here they are derived

foundation of probability theory that encompasses and generalizes both the Cox
and Kolmogorov formulations. In this picture probability is a bi-valuation
defined on a lattice of statements that quantifies the degree to which one
statement implies another. The sum rule is a constraint equation that ensures
that valuations are assigned so as to not violate associativity of the lattice
join and meet. The product rule is much more interesting in that there are
actually two product rules: one is a constraint equation arises from
associativity of the direct products of lattices, and the other a constraint
equation derived from associativity of changes of context. The generality of
this formalism enables one to derive the traditionally assumed condition of
additivity in measure theory, as well introduce a general notion of product. To
illustrate the generic utility of this novel lattice-theoretic foundation of
measure, the sum and product rules are applied to number theory. Further
application of these concepts to understand the foundation of quantum mechanics

the gate electric field in metal/insulator/semiconductor structures of

decrease of the Curie temperature, with no evidence for the maximum expected

leads to a phase separation into ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic regions, which

which covers the gap between high resolution, low dynamic range VLBI images of
the remnant and low resolution, high dynamic range images at frequencies
between 1 and 20 GHz. The radio morphology of the remnant at 36 GHz is an
elliptical ring with enhanced emission on the eastern and western sides,
similar to that seen previously at lower frequencies. Model fits to the data in
the Fourier domain show that the emitting region is consistent with a thick
inclined torus of mean radius 0.85 arcsec, and a 2008 Oct flux density of 27
+/- 6 mJy at 36.2 GHz. The spectral index for the remnant at this epoch,
determined between 1.4 GHz and 36.2 GHz, is -0.83. There is tentative evidence
for an unresolved central source with flatter spectral index.

simple procedure and proved that it provided a bound on the expected value,
$\mathit{FDR}\leq q$. Since then, many authors tried to improve the BH bound,
with one approach being designing adaptive procedures, which aim at estimating
the number of true null hypothesis in order to get a better FDR bound. Our two
main rigorous results are the following: (i) a theorem that provides a bound on
the FDR for adaptive procedures that use any estimator for the number of true
hypotheses ($m_0$), (ii) a theorem that proves a monotonicity property of
general BH-like procedures, both for the case where the hypotheses are
independent. We also propose two improved procedures for which we prove FDR
control for the independent case, and demonstrate their advantages over several
available bounds, on simulated data and on a large number of gene expression
data sets. Both applications are simple and involve a similar amount of
computation as the original BH procedure. We compare the performance of our
proposed procedures with BH and other procedures and find that in most cases we
get more power for the same level of statistical significance.

rate of the shearlet coefficients of a tempered distribution $f$ with respect

that the same result can be verified under much weaker assumptions on $\psi$,

how to build frames for $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ from any such function. To prove

produced by scattering processes in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere
showed that the Q/I profile of the lithium doublet at 6708 A has an amplitude
~10^{-4} and a curious three-peak structure, qualitatively similar to that
found and confirmed by many observers in the Na I D_2 line. Given that a
precise measurement of the scattering polarization profile of the lithium
doublet lies at the limit of the present observational possibilities, it is
worthwhile to clarify the physical origin of the observed polarization, its
diagnostic potential and what kind of Q/I shapes can be expected from theory.
To this end, we have applied the quantum theory of atomic level polarization
taking into account the hyperfine structure of the two stable isotopes of
lithium, as well as the Hanle effect of a microturbulent magnetic field of
arbitrary strength. We find that quantum interferences between the sublevels
pertaining to the upper levels of the D_2 and D_1 line transitions of lithium
do not cause any observable effect on the emergent Q/I profile. Our theoretical
calculations show that only two Q/I peaks can be expected, with the strongest
one caused by the D_2 line of ^7Li I and the weakest one due to the D_2 line of
^6Li I. Interestingly, we find that these two peaks in the theoretical Q/I
profile stand out clearly only when the kinetic temperature of the thin
atmospheric region that produces the emergent spectral line radiation is lower
than 4000 K. The fact that such region is located around a height of 200 km in
standard semi-empirical models, where the kinetic temperature is about 5000 K,
leads us to suggest that the most likely Q/I profile produced by the sun in the
lithium doublet should be slightly asymmetric and dominated by the ^7Li I peak.

the standard Josephson Hamiltonian, the single junction circuit can be analyzed
using quasi-classical methods; we formulate the conditions under which the
resulting quasi-charge dynamics is exactly dual to the usual phase dynamics
associated with Josephson tunneling. For the chain we use the fact that its
collective behavior can be characterized by one variable: the number $m$ of
quantum phase slips present on it. We conclude that the dynamics of the
conjugate quasi-charge is again exactly dual to the standard phase dynamics of
a single Josephson junction. In both cases we elucidate the role of the
inductance, essential to obtain exact duality. These conclusions have profound
consequences for the behavior of single junctions and chains under microwave
irradiation. Since both systems are governed by a model exactly dual to the

unresolved issues is whether, as a function of cosmic epoch, low-power AGNs are
more related to efficiently accreting systems (mostly radio-quiet) or to
systems with very low accretion rates (mostly radio-loud). Here we present a
sample of optically identified radio-emitting AGNs extracted from the FLS.
Preliminary results show that at the flux densities probed by the FLS (S(1.4

similarly to what found in 'brighter' sub-mJy radio samples. Very
interestingly, however, we have also a clear and direct evidence of a

with those expected from existing radio-quiet AGN modeling. Such AGNs could be
recognised as such thanks to the availability of IR colors which proved to be
especially useful to efficiently separate radio sources triggered by AGNs, from
sources triggered by star-formation. This latter result supports the idea that

hypothesis which maintains that the leading critical exponents are the same as
in the pure case and the weak universality hypothesis, which favours
dilution-dependent leading critical exponents. Here the random-site version of
the model is subject to a finite-size scaling analysis, paying special
attention to the implications for multiplicative logarithmic corrections. The
analysis is fully supportive of the scaling relations for logarithmic
corrections and of the strong scaling hypothesis in the 2D case. In the
four-dimensional case unusual corrections to scaling characterize the model,
and the precise nature of these corrections has been debated. Progress made in

31 nearby galaxy clusters from the Representative XMM-Newton Cluster Structure
Survey (REXCESS). The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to
R_1000 in all systems and out to R_500 in 13 systems. Compared to theoretical
expectations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent
excess entropy that is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass
systems. At R_500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible
within the uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy
is shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius,
becoming consistent with self-similar at R_500. The dispersion in scaled
entropy in the inner regions is linked to the presence of cool cores and
dynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by a factor of two
and the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. Parameterising the profiles
with a power law plus constant model, there are two peaks in central entropy
K_0; however, we cannot distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed
distribution. The outer slopes are correlated with system temperature; their
distribution is unimodal with a median value of 0.98. Renormalising the
dimensionless entropy profiles by the gas mass fraction profile f_gas(< R),
leads to a remarkable reduction in the scatter, implying that gas mass fraction
variations with radius and mass are the cause of the observed entropy
properties. We discuss a tentative scenario to explain the behaviour of the
entropy and gas mass fraction in the REXCESS sample, in which extra heating and
merger mixing maintains an elevated central entropy level in the majority of
the population, and a smaller fraction of systems develops a cool core.

nuclear activity in non-interacting galaxies using different methods. We focus
on the well known radiocontinuum-far infrared (FIR) correlation in order to
findradio-excess galaxies which are candidates to host an active galactic
nucleus (AGN) and FIR colours to find obscured AGN candidates. We looked for
the existing information on nuclear activity in the V\'eron-Cetty catalogue and
in the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED). We also used the nuclear spectra from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which allow us to determine the possible presence
of an AGN and to study the properties of the underlying stellar populations. We
produced a final catalogue of AGN-candidate galaxies which will provide a
baseline for the study of the nuclear activity depending on the environment. We
find that the fraction of FIR selected AGN-candidates ranges between 7% and
20%. There are no radio-excess galaxies in our sample above a factor 5 of radio
excess which is the lowest rate found in comparison with other samples in
denser environments. Finally, we obtained a fraction of about 22% of AGN using
the optical spectra, a significant fraction for a sample of isolated galaxies.
We conclude that the environment plays a crucial and direct role in triggering
radio nuclear activity and not only via the density-morphology or the
density-luminosity relations.

defined as the polymer configuration that minimizes the sum of interacting
energies between the monomers and the substrate. The fractal dimension of the
optimal polymer in the limit of strong disorder (SD) was found earlier to be
larger than the fractal dimension in weak disorder (WD). We introduce a scaling
theory for the crossover between the WD and SD limits. For polymers of various
sizes in the same disordered substrate we show that polymers with a small
number of monomers, N << N*, will behave as in SD, while large polymers with
length N >> N* will behave as in WD. This implies that small polymers will be
relatively more compact compared to large polymers even in the same substrate.
The crossover length N* is a function of \nu and a, where \nu is the
percolation correlation length exponent and a is the parameter which controls
the broadness of the disorder. Furthermore, our results show that the crossover
between the strong and weak disorder limits can be seen even within the same
polymer configuration. If one focuses on a segment of size n << N* within a
long polymer (N >> N*) that segment will have a higher fractal dimension
compared to a segment of size n >> N*.

peculiar (CP) stars can be explained by light-induced drift (LID). This effect
is additional to the radiative acceleration and appears due to systematic
asymmetry of radiative flux in partly overlapping isotopic spectral line
profiles. LID causes levitation of an isotope with a red-shifted spectral line
and sinking of an isotope with a blue-shifted line, generating thus diffusive
separation of isotopes. We have studied diffusion of mercury as a typical
well-studied isotope-rich heavy metal. Our model computations show that in
mercury-rich quiescent atmospheres of CP stars LID causes levitation of the
heavier mercury isotopes and sinking of the lighter ones. Precise quantitative
modelling of the process of isotope separation demands very high-resolution
computations and the high-precision input data, including data on hyperfine and
isotopic splitting of spectral lines, adequate line profiles and impact
cross-sections. Presence of microturbulence and weak stellar winds can
essentially reduce the effect of radiative-driven diffusion.

Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) phenomenological model for the
scattering process between the vortex and thermal excitations in liquid 4He.
The HVBK equations are analytically formulated first in the intrinsic geometric
parameter space to obtain insights into the physical implications of the
friction terms, associated with the friction coefficients alpha and alpha^prime
(in the Hall-Vinen notation) as well as the previous neglect of the friction
term associated with the friction coefficient alpha^prime. The normal fluid
velocity components both along and transverse to the vortex filament are
included. This analytical development also serves to highlight the difficulties
arising in making further progress on this route. A reformulation of the HVBK
equation in the extrinsic vortex filament coordinate space is then given which
is known (Shivamoggi) to provide a useful alternative analytical approach in
this regard. A nonlinear Schrodinger equation for the propagation of nonlinear
Kelvin waves on a vortex filament in a superfluid is given taking into account
the generalized normal fluid flow. The friction term associated with
alpha^prime, even in the presence of the normal fluid velocity components
transverse to the vortex filament, is shown to produce merely an algebraic
growth of the Kelvin waves hence providing further justification for the
neglect of this term. On the other hand, the instability produced by the
friction term associated with alpha via the normal fluid velocity component
along the vortex filament is shown to manifest itself as a parametric
amplification on considering the problem of a rotating planar vortex filament
in a superfluid.

the Z track (horizontal, normal, and flaring branches). We find that the NUV
emission is uncorrelated with the soft X-ray flux detected with the XRT, and is
anticorrelated with the BAT X-ray flux and the hard X-ray color. The observed
anticorrelation is inconsistent with simple models of reprocessing as the
source of the NUV emission. The anticorrelation may be a consequence of the
high inclination angle of Cyg X-2, where NUV emission is preferentially
scattered by a corona that expands as the disk is radiatively heated.
Alternatively, if the accretion disk thickens as Cyg X-2 goes down the normal
branch toward the flaring branch, this may be able to explain the observed
anticorrelation. In these models the NUV emission may not be a good proxy for
$\dot m$ in the system. We also discuss the implications of using Swift/XRT to
perform spectral modeling of the continuum emission of NSXRBs.

temperature-stacked LFs in three filters, g', r' and z', down to M=-14.5. All
LFs were fitted by Schechter functions which constrained the faint-end slope,
alpha, but did not always fit well to the bright end. Derived values of alpha
ranged from -1.03 to as steep as -2.1. We find no evidence for upturns at faint
magnitudes. Evolution in alpha was apparent in all bands: it becomes shallower
with increasing redshift; for example, in the z' band it flattened from -1.75
at low redshift to -1.22 in the redshift range z=0.43-0.61. Eight of our
systems lie at z~0.3, and we combine these to generate a galaxy LF in three
