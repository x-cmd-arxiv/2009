of massive galaxies at z~2.3, by extending our sample of 9 compact quiescent
galaxies (r_e~0.9 kpc) with 10 massive emission-line galaxies. The
emission-line galaxies are classified by the nature of their ionized emission;
there are six star-forming galaxies and four galaxies hosting an active
galactic nucleus (AGN). The star-forming galaxies are the largest among the
emission-line galaxies, with a median size of re = 2.8 kpc. The three galaxies
with the highest star formation rates (> 100M \odot/yr) have irregular and
clumpy morphologies. The AGN host galaxies are more similar to the compact
quiescent galaxies in terms of their structures (re~1.1 kpc) and spectral
energy distributions. The total sample clearly separates into two classes in a
color-mass diagram: the large star-forming galaxies that form the blue cloud,
and the compact quiescent galaxies on the red sequence. However, it is unclear
how or even if the two classes are evolutionary related. Three out of six
massive star-forming galaxies have dense cores and thus may passively evolve
into compact galaxies due to fading of outer star-forming regions. For these
galaxies a reverse scenario, in which compact galaxies grow inside-out by star
formation is also plausible. We do caution though that the sample is small.
Nonetheless, it is evident that a Hubble sequence of massive galaxies with
strongly correlated galaxy properties is already in place at z > 2.

Within pre-translocation ribosomal complexes, the L1 stalk exists in a dynamic
equilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of elongation factor
G (EF-G) shifts this equilibrium towards the closed conformation through one of
at least two distinct kinetic mechanisms, where the identity of the P-site tRNA

L1 stalk dynamics are dependent on the presence and identity of the E-site

subsequently TFA, we search for variables in the full sample by using DFT and
BLS methods. We select variables based on the statistics related to these
methods combined with visual inspections. We identified 12 new variables (2 RR
Lyrae stars, 7 short periodic stars - 3 of them are SX Phe stars - and 3
long-period variables). No eclipsing binaries were found in the present sample.
Except for the 3 (hitherto unknown) Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, no multiperiodic
variables were found. We showed that after proper period shift, the PLC
relation for the first overtone RR Lyrae sample tightly follows the one spanned
by the fundamental stars. Furthermore, the slope is in agreement with the one
derived from other clusters. Based on the earlier Baade-Wesselink calibration
of the PLC relations, the derived reddening-free distance modulus of M53 is
16.31 +/- 0.04 mag, corresponding to a distance modulus of 18.5 mag for the
Large Magellanic Cloud. From the Fourier parameters of the RRab stars we
obtained an average iron abundance of -1.58 +/- 0.03. This is ~0.5 dex higher
than the overall abundance of the giants as given in the literature and derived
in this paper from the three-color photometry of giants. We suspect that the

resistivity, that is dominated by superconducting fluctuations above the BKT
transition temperature $T_{BKT}$ and by inhomogeneity below it. By means of a
renormalization-group approach we establish a direct correspondence between the
parameter values used to describe the BKT fluctuation regime and the distance
between $T_{BKT}$ and the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau transition temperature.
Below $T_{BKT}$ a resistive tail arises due to finite-size effect and

correlation of local coordinates to TC in the newly discovered superconducting
FeSe1-xTex. The isovalent substitution of Te for Se such as in FeSe0.5Te0.5
increases Tc by twofold in comparison to a-FeSe without changing the carrier
concentration but, on average, decreases the chalcogen-Fe bond angle. However,
we find that the local symmetry is lower than the average P4/nmm crystal
symmetry, because the Se and Te ions do not share the same site, leading to two
distinct z-coordinates that exhibit two types of bond angles with Fe. The angle
indeed increases from ~ 104.02o in FeSe to ~105.20o in FeSe0.5Te0.5 between Fe
and Se. Simultaneously, ab-initio calculations based on spin density function
theory yielded an optimized structure with distinct z-coordinates for Se and
Te, in agreement with the experiment. The valence charge distribution in the
Fe-Se bonds was found to be different from that in the Fe-Te bonds. Thus,
superconductivity in this chalcogenide is closely related to the local
structural environment, with direct implications on the multiband magnetism
where modulations of the ionic lattice can change the distribution of valence
electrons.

reheating in such models occurs through perturbative decays. However, we find
that there are very strong non-perturbative preheating decay channels related
to the particular shape of the inflaton potential (which is highly nonlinear
and has a very steep minimum). Preheating after modular inflation, proceeding
through a combination of tachyonic instability and broad-band parametric
resonance, is perhaps the most violent example of preheating after inflation
known in the literature. Further, we consider the subsequent transfer of energy
to the standard model sector in scenarios where the standard model particles
are confined to a D7-brane wrapping the inflationary blow-up cycle of the
compactification manifold or, more interestingly, a non-inflationary blow up
cycle. We explicitly identify the decay channels of the inflaton in these two
scenarios. We also consider the case where the inflationary cycle shrinks to
the string scale at the end of inflation; here a field theoretical treatment of
reheating is insufficient and one must turn instead to a stringy description.
We estimate the decay rate of the inflaton and the reheat temperature for
various scenarios.

Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to
the midplane, no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations. It

By analyzing time series of azimuthally-averaged flow quantities, we identify
an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones. This mode is
reduced in amplitude, but not suppressed entirely, by changing the equation of

Accurate and precise radii of the detected planets depend on knowing the radius
of the host star accurately, which is difficult unless the temperature and
luminosity of the star are known precisely. Kepler, however, has an
asteroseismology programme that will provide seismic variables that can
characterise stellar radii easily, accurately, and extremely precisely. In this
paper we describe the Yale-Birmingham (YB) method to determine stellar radii
using a combination of seismic and conventional variables, and analyse the
effect of these variables on the result. We find that for main-sequence stars,
a knowledge of the parallax is not important to get accurate radii using the YB
method: we can get results to an accuracy and precision of better than a few
percent if we know the effective temperature and the seismic parameters for
these stars. Metallicity does not make much difference either. However, good
estimates of the effective temperature and metallicity, along with those of the
seismic parameters, are essential to determine radii of sub giants properly. On
the other hand, for red giants we find that determining radii properly is not
possible without a good estimate of the parallax. We find that the so called
""surface term"" in the seismic data has minimal effect on the inferred radii.
Uncertainties in the convective mixing length can matter under some
circumstances and can cause a systematic shift in the inferred radii. Blind
tests with data simulated to match those expected from the asteroseismic Survey
Phase of Kepler show that it will be possible to infer stellar radii
successfully using our method.

For certain D-particles, a finite number of microstates, namely polar states,
exclusively realized as bound states, determine an entire partition function
(elliptic genus). This underlines their crucial importance: one might call them
the `chromosomes' of a D-particle or a black hole. As polar states also can be

non-trivial evidence for a strong split attractor flow tree conjecture, and
thus suggest that we indeed exhaust the BPS spectrum. In the D-brane
description of a bound state, the necessity for refinement results from the
fact that tachyonic strings split up constituent states into `generic' and
`special' states. These are enumerated separately by topological invariants,
which turn out to be partitions of Donaldson-Thomas invariants. As modular

and rejecting the systems that are known to be affected by systematic errors
(due to further multiplicity or obscuration by circumstellar material), we find
that the relative binary ages, |Delta log(tau)|, have an overall dispersion of
sigma~0.40 dex. Random pairs of Taurus members are coeval only to within
sigma~0.58 dex, indicating that Taurus binaries are indeed more coeval than the
association as a whole. However, the distribution of |Delta log(tau)| suggests
two populations, with ~2/3 of the sample appearing coeval to within the errors
(sigma~0.16 dex) and the other ~1/3 distributed in an extended tail reaching
|Delta log(tau)|~0.4-0.9 dex. To explain the finding of a multi-peaked

includes unrecognized hierarchical multiples, stars seen in scattered light, or
stars with disk contamination; additional followup is required to rule out or
correct for these explanations. The relative coevality of binary systems does
not depend significantly on the system mass, mass ratio, or separation. Indeed,
any pair of Taurus members wider than ~10' (~0.7 pc) shows the full age spread

Eulerian methods, accounts for the effects previously identified as evidence
for the Galilean non-invariance of these methods. These velocity-dependent
diffusive terms lead to different results for different bulk velocities when
the spatial resolution of the simulation is kept fixed, but their effect
becomes negligible as the resolution of the simulation is increased to obtain a
converged solution. In particular, we find that Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities
develop properly in realistic Eulerian calculations regardless of the bulk
velocity provided the problem is simulated with sufficient resolution (a factor
of 2-4 increase compared to the case without bulk flows for realistic
velocities). Our results reiterate that high-resolution Eulerian methods can
perform well and obtain a convergent solution, even in the presence of highly

hot dense medium. One type of hot dense medium, which we study, is hadronic gas
produced at quark gluon plasma hadronization in heavy ions collisions in SPS,
RHIC and LHC experiments. We study hadron production at non-equilibrium quark
gluon plasma hadronization and their evolution in thermal hadronic gas phase.
We use non-equilibrium hadronization as the initial condition in the study of
hadronic kinetic phase. During this time period some hadronic resonances can be
produced in lighter hadrons fusion. Production of resonances is dominant over
decay if there is non-equilibrium excess of decay products. Within this model
we explain apparently contradictory experimental results reported in RHIC
experiments: Sigma(1385) yield is enhanced while Lambda(1520) yield is
suppressed compared to the statistical hadronization model expectation obtained
without kinetic phase. We also predict Delta(1232) enhancement. The second type
of plasma medium we consider is the relativistic electron positron photon
plasma drop. This plasma is expected to be produced in decay of supercritical
field created in ultrashort laser pulse. We study at what conditions this
plasma drop is opaque for photons and therefore may reach thermal and chemical
equilibrium. Further we consider muon and pion production in this plasma also
as a diagnostic tool. Finally all these theoretical developments can be applied
to begin a study of particles evolution in early universe in temperatures
domain from QGP hadronization (160 MeV) to nucleosynthesis (0.1 MeV). The first
results on pion equilibration are presented here.

of the weak lensing bispectrum at capturing non-Gaussian features in the dark

spectrum, the bispectrum and the expected number of detected clusters, and
derive constraints on cosmological parameters for a large, low systematic weak
lensing survey, by focusing on the $\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane and on the dark
energy equation of state. We separate the power spectrum into the resolved and
the unresolved parts of the data, the resolved part being defined as detected
clusters, and the unresolved part as the rest of the field. We consider four
kinds of clusters counts, taking into account different amount of information :
signal-to-noise ratio peak counts; counts as a function of clusters' mass;
counts as a function of clusters' redshift; and counts as a function of
clusters' mass and redshift. We show that when combined with the power
spectrum, those four kinds of counts provide similar constraints, thus allowing
one to perform the most direct counts, signal-to-noise peaks counts, and get
percent level constraints on cosmological parameters. We show that the weak
lensing bispectrum gives constraints comparable to those given by the power
spectrum and captures non-Gaussian features as well as clusters counts, its
combination with the power spectrum giving errors on cosmological parameters
that are similar to, if not marginally smaller than, those obtained when
combining the power spectrum with cluster counts. We finally note that in order
to reach its potential, the weak lensing bispectrum must be computed using all
triangle configurations, as equilateral triangles alone do not provide useful

for the cosmic acceleration. To linear order, these departures (quantified by
the model-independent parameter $\varpi$, referred to as a `gravitational
slip') amplify or suppress the growth of structure in the universe relative to
what we would expect to see from a general relativistic universe lately
dominated by a cosmological constant. As structures collapse and become more
dense, linear perturbation theory is an inadequate descriptor of their
behavior, and one must extend calculations to non-linear order. If the effects
of gravitational slip extend to these higher orders, we might expect to see a
signature of $\varpi$ in the bispectrum of galaxies distributed on the sky. We
solve the equations of motion for non-linear perturbations in the presence of
gravitational slip and find that, while there is an effect on the bispectrum,
it is too weak to be detected with present galaxy surveys. We also develop a
formalism for incorporating scale dependence into our description of
gravitational slip.

based on a three-dimensional (3-D) magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) simulation of
two CMEs observed by SECCHI on January 24-27, 2007. Having a 3-D simulation
with synthetic HI images, we are able to compare the two basic methods used to
derive CME positions from elongation angles, the so-called ""Point-P"" and
""Fixed-Phi"" approximations.
  We confirm, following similar works, that both methods, while valid in the
most inner heliosphere, yield increasingly large errors in HI-2 field of view
for fast and wide CMEs. Using a simple model of a CME as an expanding
self-similar sphere, we derive an analytical relationship between elongation
angles and radial distances for wide CMEs. This relationship is simply the
harmonic mean of the ""Point-P"" and ""Fixed-Phi'' approximations and it is aimed
at complementing 3-D fitting of CMEs by cone models or flux rope shapes. It
proves better at getting the kinematics of the simulated CME right when we
compare the results of our line-of-sights to the MHD simulation. Based on this
approximation, we re-analyze the J-maps (time-elongation maps) in January
26-27, 2007 and present the first observational evidence that the merging of
CMEs is associated with a momentum exchange from the faster ejection to the
slower one due to the propagation of the shock wave associated with the fast
eruption through the slow eruption.

is studied. Using a nonlinear Volterra integral equation, we obtain an analytic
formula for final probability of the transition to the molecular state for weak
interaction limit. Considering the strong coupling limit of high field
intensities, we show that the system reveals two different time-evolution
pictures depending on the detuning of the frequency of the associating field.
For both limit cases we derive highly accurate formulas for the molecular state
probability valid for the whole range of variation of time. Using these
formulas, we show that at large detuning regime the molecule formation process
occurs almost non-oscillatory in time and a Rosen-Zener pulse is not able to
associate more than one third of atoms at any time point. The system returns to
its initial all-atomic state at the end of the process and the maximal
transition probability is achieved when the field intensity reaches its peak.
In contrast, at small detuning the evolution of the system displays
large-amplitude oscillations between atomic and molecular populations. We find
that the shape of the oscillations in the first approximation is defined by the
field detuning only. Finally, a hidden singularity of the Rosen-Zener model due
to the specific time-variation of the field amplitude at the beginning of the
interaction is indicated. It is this singularity that stands for many of the
qualitative and quantitative properties of the model. The singularity may be
viewed as an effective resonance-touching.

condensate via two-mode one-color photoassociation or sweep across a Feshbach

For the general class of term-crossing models with constant coupling, a common
strategy for attacking the problem is developed based on the reduction of the
initial system of semiclassical equations for atom-molecule amplitudes to a
third order nonlinear differential equation for the molecular state
probability. This equation provides deriving exact solution for a class of
periodic level-crossing models. These models reveal much in common with the
Rabi problem. Discussing the strong-coupling limit for the general case of
variable detuning, the equation is further truncated to a limit first-order
nonlinear equation. Using this equation, the strong nonlinearity regime for the
first Nikitin exponential-crossing model is analyzed and accurate asymptotic
expressions for the nonlinear transition probability to the molecular state are
derived. It is shown that, because of a finite final detuning involved, this
model displays essential deviations from the Landau-Zener behavior. In
particular, it is shown that in the limit of strong coupling the final
conversion probability tends to 1/6. Thus, in this case the strong interaction
limit is not optimal for molecule formation. We have found that if optimal
field intensity is applied the molecular probability is increased up to 1/4

require joint communication rate determination either among the transmitters or

characterized by an achievable region defined in terms of communication rates,
such that reliable packet recovery is supported for all rates inside the region

which decreases the computational complexity of SD substantially, without

decoding metric to decrease the number of computations and exploiting the
structure of a lattice representation. Furthermore, an application of SD,
employing a proposed smart implementation with very low computational

bit-interleaved convolutional-coded MIMO system in an efficient manner. Based
on the reduced complexity SD, the proposed smart implementation employs the
initial radius acquired by Zero-Forcing Decision Feedback Equalization (ZF-DFE)
which ensures no empty spheres. Other than that, a technique of a particular
data structure is also incorporated to efficiently reduce the number of

symmetry-breaking transitions. One of the characteristic features is the
concomitant divergence of order-parameter and uniform fluctuations in contrast
to the conventional quantum critical point (QCP). Several puzzling
non-Fermi-liquid properties are referred to be accounted for as in the cases of
YbRh2Si2, CeRu2Si2 and beta-YbAlB4. Another more dramatic unconventionality
appears in this case for topological transitions such as metal-insulator and
Lifshitz transitions. This border, the marginal quantum critical point (MQCP),
belongs to an unprecedented universality class with diverging uniform
fluctuations at zero temperature. The MQCP has a unique feature by a combined
character of symmetry-breaking and topological transitions. The theoretical
results are supported by experimental indications for V2-xCrxO3 and an organic
conductor kappa-(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]Cl. Identifying topological transitions also

simple signal models with few parameters. Various authors have suggested that a
general, flexible, yet efficient alternative can be found in randomized
placement strategies such as random placement and stochastic placement, which
enhances random placement by selectively rejecting templates that are too close
to others. In this article we explore several theoretical and practical issues

banks; the effects of parameter-space boundaries; the use of quasi-random (self
avoiding) number sequences; most important, the implementation of these
algorithms in curved signal manifolds with and without the use of a Riemannian

dominated by early-type galaxies containing the least total HI. We determined
the expected HI for the spiral galaxies in the groups, and found that a number

For $T_c<T<1.15T_c$, both channels exhibit stronger spatial correlations than

semi-quantitatively successful description of the vacuum-subtracted $F^2$

properties. In the field of Anderson localization, Mirlin, Fyodorov,
Mildenberger and Evers [Phys. Rev. Lett 97, 046803 (2006)] have proposed that
the singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$ of eigenfunctions satisfies the exact
symmetry $f(2d-\alpha)=f(\alpha)+d-\alpha$ at any Anderson transition. In the
present paper, we analyse the physical origin of this symmetry in relation with
the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation relations of large deviation functions that
are well-known in the field of non-equilibrium dynamics: the multifractal
spectrum of the disordered model corresponds to the large deviation function of
the rescaling exponent $\gamma=(\alpha-d)$ along a renormalization trajectory
in the effective time $t=\ln L$. We conclude that the symmetry discovered on
the specific example of Anderson transitions should actually be satisfied at
many other random critical points after an appropriate translation. For
many-body random phase transitions, where the critical properties are usually
analyzed in terms of the multifractal spectrum $H(a)$ and of the moments
exponents X(N) of two-point correlation function [A. Ludwig, Nucl. Phys. B330,
639 (1990)], the symmetry becomes $H(2X(1) -a)= H(a) + a-X(1)$, or equivalently
$\Delta(N)=\Delta(1-N)$ for the anomalous parts $\Delta(N) \equiv X(N)-NX(1)$.
We present numerical tests in favor of this symmetry for the 2D random

temperature and magnetic field, are discussed in their application to solar
magnetic structures. Strongly growing modes are found for some typical plasma
parameters. These instabilities i) imply the presence of electric fields that
can accelerate the plasma particles in both perpendicular and parallel
directions with respect to the magnetic field vector, and ii) can
stochastically heat ions. The perpendicular acceleration is to the leading
order determined by the $\bmath{E}\times \bmath{B}$-drift acting equally on
both ions and electrons, while the parallel acceleration is most effective on
electrons. The experimentally confirmed stochastic heating is shown to act
mainly in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field vector and acts
stronger on heavier ions. The energy release rate and heating may exceed for
several orders of magnitude the value accepted as necessary for a
self-sustained heating in the solar corona. The energy source for both the
acceleration and the heating is stored in the mentioned background gradients.

gravitational wake it excites in the ambient medium. This interaction is
usually derived assuming that the perturber has a constant velocity. In
realistic situations, motion is accelerated as for instance by dynamical
friction itself. Here, we study the effect of acceleration on the dynamical
friction force. We characterize the density enhancement associated with a
constantly accelerating perturber with rectilinear motion in an infinite
homogeneous gaseous medium and show that dynamical friction is not a local
force and that its amplitude may depend on the perturber's initial velocity.
The force on an accelerating perturber is maximal between Mach 1 and Mach 2,
where it is smaller than the corresponding uniform motion friction. In the
limit where the perturber's size is much smaller than the distance needed to
change the Mach number by unity through acceleration, a subsonic perturber
feels a force similar to uniform motion friction only if its past history does
not include supersonic episodes. Once an accelerating perturber reaches large
supersonic speeds, accelerated motion friction is marginally stronger than
uniform motion friction. The force on a decelerating supersonic perturber is
weaker than uniform motion friction as the velocity decreases to a few times
the sound speed. Dynamical friction on a decelerating subsonic perturber with
an initial Mach number larger than 2 is much larger than uniform motion
friction and tends to a finite value as the velocity vanishes in contrast to
uniform motion friction.

Bean's model reveals almost the exact J_c(B) behavior, if the evaluation is

such a tubular model allows one to use a parametric model while treating it as
an approximation to the true distribution. In this paper, the Kullback--Leibler
distance is used to build the tubular region. Based on this idea one can define
the distance between the true multinomial distribution and the parametric model
to be the index of fit. The paper develops a likelihood ratio test procedure
for testing the magnitude of the index. A semiparametric bootstrap method is
implemented to better approximate the distribution of the LRT statistic. The
approximation permits more accurate construction of a lower confidence limit
for the model fitting index.

that the model simplifications are still severe. One approximation that has to
be blamed is homogeneity. Stellar-wind clumping on small scales was easily
implemented, while ""macro-clumping"" is still a big challenge. First studies
showed that macro-clumping can reduce the strength of predicted P-Cygni line

Thereby, the onset of motion and choice of direction may be the result of a

preexisting asymmetries, e.g. through a previous septation in bacteria.
Although very complex, a key feature of cellular motility is the ability of
actin to form dense polymeric networks, whose microstructure is tightly
regulated by the cell. These polar actin networks produce the forces necessary
for propulsion but may also be at the origin of a spontaneous
symmetry-breaking. Understanding the exact role of actin dynamics in cell
motility requires multiscale approaches which capture at the same time the
polymer network structure and dynamics on the scale of a few nanometers and the

known from large deviations theory for single queuing systems with fBm through
traffic. In this paper we derive end-to-end performance bounds for a through

prove a rigorous sample path envelope for fBm that complements previous
approximate results. We find that both approaches agree in their outcome that
overflow probabilities for fBm traffic have a Weibullian tail. We employ the
sample path envelope and the concept of leftover service curves to model the
remaining service after scheduling fBm cross traffic at a system. Using
composition results for tandem systems from the stochastic network calculus we
derive end-to-end statistical performance bounds for individual flows in
networks under fBm cross traffic. We discover that these bounds grow in O(n

the fBm cross traffic. We show numerical results on the impact of the

monitor the dynamics of MS packings along geometrical families by applying
quasistatic simple shear strain at zero pressure. For small numbers of
particles (N < 16), we find that the dynamics is deterministic and highly
contracting. That is, if the system is initialized in a MS packing at a given

strain, and therefore sample only a very small fraction of the possible MS

series of unprecedented quality for our targets (~ 200 spectra in total),
essentially in the blue domain, covering time-scales from a few hours up to a
few years. Time Variance Spectrum (TVS) and Fourier analyses were performed in
order to characterize their spectral variability. We report on a correlated
significant line profile variability in the prominent He II \lambda 4686 and
H\beta lines most likely related to the strong stellar winds. The variability
pattern is similar for the three stars investigated (HD14947, HD15570 and
HD16691), and the main differences are more quantitative than qualitative.
However, the reported time-scales are somewhat different, and the most striking
variability pattern is reported for HD16691. We did not find any clear evidence
for binarity, and we focus mainly on an interpretation based on a single star
scenario. We show that the behaviour of the three stars investigated in this
study present strong similarities, pointing to a putative common scenario, even
though a few differences should be noted. Our preferred interpretation scheme
is that of Large Scale Corotating Structures modulating the profile of the
lines that are produced in the strong stellar wind.

specifically on neutron entanglement, showing that the spins of two or more
distinct neutrons can be measurably entangled by forward-scattering from an
isotropic medium. The interpretation of `time' in scattering experiments is
also discussed. I present a simple treatment based on the Heisenberg S-matrix,
from which it emerges that in certain situations the quantum-mechanical time
parameter appearing in the effective time-evolution operator for the spin
system has an intuitive physical interpretation. The final part of the thesis
deals with quantum information transfer in arrays of permanently coupled
dipolar systems. It is shown that spin chains with dipolar couplings offer high
fidelity long-distance state transmission, but transfer times in unmodulated
chains are unfeasibly long. Possible optimization methods are discussed,

on complex networks, which provides a rigorous lower bound for the mean
first-passage time of a random walker to a target site averaged over its
starting position, the so-called global mean first-passage time (GMFPT). This
bound is simply expressed in terms of the equilibrium distribution at the
target, and implies a minimal scaling of the GMFPT with the network size. We
show that this minimal scaling, which can be arbitrarily slow for a proper
choice of highly connected target, is realized under the simple condition that
the random walk is transient at the target site, and independently of the
small-world, scale free or fractal properties of the network. Last, we put
forward that the GMFPT to a specific target is not a representative property of
the network, since the target averaged GMFPT satisfies much more restrictive
bounds, which forbid any sublinear scaling with the network size.

program aimed to obtain spectral mapping of a sample of 14 local (d<76Mpc)
LIRGs. The data cubes map, at least, the central 20arcsec x 20arcsec to
30arcsec x 30arcsec regions of the galaxies, and use all four IRS modules
covering the full 5-38micron spectral range. The final goal of this project is
to characterize fully the mid-IR properties of local LIRGs as a first step to
understanding their more distant counterparts. In this paper we present the
first results of this GTO program. The IRS spectral mapping data allow us to
build spectral maps of the bright mid-IR emission lines (e.g., [NeII], [NeIII],
[SIII], H_2), continuum, the 6.2 and 11.3micron PAH features, and the 9.7micron
silicate feature, as well as to extract 1D spectra for regions of interest in
each galaxy. The IRS data are used to obtain spatially resolved measurements of
the extinction using the 9.7micron silicate feature, and to trace star forming
regions using the neon lines and the PAH features. We also investigate a number
of AGN indicators, including the presence of high excitation emission lines and
a strong dust continuum emission at around 6micron. We finally use the
integrated Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates of local LIRGs. We discuss several
possible uses for these templates, including the calibration of the star
formation rate of IR-bright galaxies at high redshift. We also predict the

thermal properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) in hydrodynamical

using a version of the TreePM-SPH Gadget code that follows chemo-dynamical
evolution by accounting for metal enrichment by different stellar populations.
Besides runs not including any efficient form of energy feedback, we carry out
simulations including: (i) kinetic feedback in the form of galactic winds
triggered by supernova explosions; (ii) AGN feedback from gas accretion onto
super-massive black holes (BHs); (iii) AGN feedback in which a 'radio mode' is
included. We find that AGN feedback is able to quench star formation in the
brightest cluster galaxies at z<4 and provides correct temperature profiles in
the central regions of galaxy groups. However, its effect is not sufficient to
create cool cores in massive clusters. AGN feedback creates a widespread
enrichment in the outskirts of clusters, thanks to its efficiency in displacing
enriched gas from galactic halos to the inter-galactic medium at relatively
high redshift. Iron abundance profiles are in better agreement with
observations, with a more pristine enrichment of the ICM around and beyond the
cluster virial regions. From the pattern of the relative abundances of Silicon
and Iron, we conclude that a significant fraction of ICM enrichment in
simulations is contributed by a diffuse population of intra-cluster stars. Our
simulations also predict that profiles of Z_Si/Z_Fe abundance ratio do not
increase at least out to 0.5 R_vir. Our results clearly show that different
sources of energy feedback leave distinct imprints in the enrichment pattern of
the ICM, that are more evident when looking at cluster external regions.

behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of
time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial
superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the
cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of
control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate
elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.

excellent sample to study the Li depletion in the pre-main sequence (PMS)

constrain the PMS evolution. We have calculated the LTE Li abundances for 376
members of different young associations. In addition we considered the effects
of their projected stellar rotation. We present the Li depletion as function of
age in the first hundred million years for the first time for the most extended
sample of Li abundances in young stellar associations. A clear Li depletion can
be measured in the temperature range from 5000K to 3500K for the age span
covered by these nine associations. The age sequence based on the Li-clock
agrees well with the isochronal ages, $\epsilon$Cha association being the only
possible exception. The lithium depletion patterns for those associations
resemble those of the young open clusters, strengthening the notion that the
members proposed for these loose young associations have indeed a common
physical origin. The observed scatter in the Li abundances hampers the use of
Li to determine reliable ages for individual stars. Rotation velocities above
20 km s$^{-1}$ seem to inhibit the Li depletion.

Algebra 2 (2010), 327-357",,,"math.AC math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stanley decompositions of multigraded modules $M$ over polynomials rings have
been discussed intensively in recent years. There is a natural notion of depth
that goes with a Stanley decomposition, called the Stanley depth. Stanley
conjectured that the Stanley depth of a module $M$ is always at least the
(classical) depth of $M$. In this paper we introduce a weaker type of
decomposition, which we call Hilbert decomposition, since it only depends on
the Hilbert function of $M$, and an analogous notion of depth, called Hilbert
depth. Since Stanley decompositions are Hilbert decompositions, the latter set
upper bounds to the existence of Stanley decompositions. The advantage of
Hilbert decompositions is that they are easier to find. We test our new notion
on the syzygy modules of the residue class field of $K[X_1,...,X_n]$ (as usual
identified with $K$). Writing $M(n,k)$ for the $k$-th syzygy module, we show
that theHilbert depth of M(n,1) is $\lfloor(n+1)/2\rfloor$. Furthermore, we
show that, for $n > k \ge \lfloor n/2\rfloor$, the Hilbert depth of $M(n,k)$ is
equal to $n-1$. We conjecture that the same holds for the Stanley depth. For
the range $n/2 > k > 1$, it seems impossible to come up with a compact formula
for the Hilbert depth. Instead, we provide very precise asymptotic results as
$n$ becomes large.

8-10 Myr old Orion OB1a complex and one, TW Hya, in the 10 Myr old TW Hydrae
Association. We also obtained FUV ACS/SBC spectra of 10 non-accreting sources
surrounded by debris disks with ages between 10 and 125 Myr. We use a feature
in the FUV spectra due mostly to electron impact excitation of \h2 to study the
evolution of the gas in the inner disk. We find that the \h2 feature is absent
in non-accreting sources, but is detected in the spectra of CTTS and correlates
with accretion luminosity. Since all young stars have active chromospheres
which produce strong X-ray and UV emission capable of exciting \h2 in the disk,
the fact that the non-accreting sources show no \h2 emission implies that the
\h2 gas in the inner disk has dissipated in the non-accreting sources, although
dust (and possibly gas) remains at larger radii. Using the flux at 1600 {\AA},
we estimate that the column density of \h2 left in the inner regions of the
debris disks in our sample is less than ~ 3x10^-6 g cm^-2, nine orders of
magnitude below the surface density of the minimum mass solar nebula at 1 AU.

NH3, directly associated with CH3OH Class II maser emission. From the remaining
eleven sources, six show clear signatures of rotation and/or infall motions.
These signatures vary from velocity gradients perpendicular to the outflows, to
infall signatures in absorption against ultracompact HII regions, to more
spherical infall signatures in emission. Although our spatial resolution is
~1000AU, we do not find clear Keplerian signatures in any of the sources.
Furthermore, we also do not find flattened structures. In contrast to this, in
several of the sources with rotational signatures, the spatial structure is
approximately spherical with sizes exceeding 10^4 AU, showing considerable
clumpy sub-structure at even smaller scales. This implies that on average
typical Keplerian accretion disks -- if they exist as expected -- should be
confined to regions usually smaller than 1000AU. It is likely that these disks
are fed by the larger-scale rotating envelope structure we observe here.
Furthermore, we do detect 1.25cm continuum emission in most fields of view.
