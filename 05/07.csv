highly-collimated explosions (opening angle theta ~ 1-10 deg). As a result of
this beaming factor, the true energy release from a GRB is usually several
orders of magnitude smaller than the observed isotropic value. Measuring this
opening angle, typically inferred from an achromatic steepening in the
afterglow light curve (a ""jet"" break), has proven exceedingly difficult in the
Swift era. Here we undertake a study of five of the brightest (in terms of the
isotropic prompt gamma-ray energy release, E(gamma, iso)) GRBs in the Swift era
to search for jet breaks and hence constrain the collimation-corrected energy
release. We present multi-wavelength (radio through X-ray) observations of GRBs
050820A, 060418, and 080319B, and construct afterglow models to extract the
opening angle and beaming-corrected energy release for all three events.
Together with results from previous analyses of GRBs 050904 and 070125, we find
evidence for an achromatic jet break in all five events, strongly supporting
the canonical picture of GRBs as collimated explosions. The most natural
explanation for the lack of observed jet breaks from most Swift GRBs is
therefore selection effects. However, the opening angles for the events in our
sample are larger than would be expected if all GRBs had a canonical energy
release of ~ 10e51 erg. The total energy release we measure for those
""hyper-energetic"" (E(total) >~ 10e52 erg) events in our sample is large enough
to start challenging models with a magnetar as the compact central remnant.

Mrk 421 with the Suzaku satellite in 2006 April 28. During the observation, Mrk
421 was undergoing a large flare and the X-ray flux was variable, decreasing by
~ 50 %, from 7.8x10^{-10} to 3.7x10^{-10} erg/s/cm^2 in about 6 hours, followed
by an increase by ~ 35 %. Thanks to the broad bandpass coupled with
high-sensitivity of Suzaku, we measured the evolution of the spectrum over the
0.4--60 keV band in data segments as short as ~1 ksec. The data show deviations
from a simple power law model, but also a clear spectral variability. The
time-resolved spectra are fitted by a synchrotron model, where the observed
spectrum is due to a exponentially cutoff power law distribution of electrons
radiating in uniform magnetic field; this model is preferred over a broken
power law. As another scenario, we separate the spectrum into ""steady"" and
""variable"" components by subtracting the spectrum in the lowest-flux period
from those of other data segments. In this context, the difference (""variable"")
spectra are all well described by a broken power law model with photon index
Gamma ~ 1.6, breaking at energy epsilon_{brk} ~ 3 keV to another photon index
Gamma ~ 2.1 above the break energy, differing from each other only by
normalization, while the spectrum of the ""steady"" component is best described
by the synchrotron model. We suggest the rapidly variable component is due to
relatively localized shock (Fermi I) acceleration, while the slowly variable
(""steady"") component is due to the superposition of shocks located at larger
distance along the jet, or due to other acceleration process, such as the
stochastic acceleration on magnetic turbulence (Fermi II) in the more extended
region.

that shape the dynamics of large networks of spiking neurons. Previous work has
shown that such effective delays can be taken into account with a rate model
through the addition of an explicit, fixed delay [Roxin et al. PRL 238103
(2005)]. Here we extend this work to account for arbitrary symmetric patterns
of synaptic connectivity and generic nonlinear transfer functions.
Specifically, we conduct a weakly nonlinear analysis of the dynamical states
arising via primary instabilities of the asynchronous state. In this way we
determine analytically how the nature and stability of these states depend on
the choice of transfer function and connectivity. We arrive at two general
observations of physiological relevance that could not be explained in previous
works. These are: 1 - Fast oscillations are always supercritical for realistic
transfer functions. 2 - Traveling waves are preferred over standing waves given
plausible patterns of local connectivity. We finally demonstrate that these
results show a good agreement with those obtained performing numerical
simulations of a network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons.

discussing their signature in the corresponding off-shell effective action. The
origin of these contributions, in the most general kinematical case, is
elucidated by performing a complete analysis of the anomaly vertex at
perturbative level. We use two independent (but equivalent) representations:
the Rosenberg representation and the longitudinal/transverse (L/T)
parameterization, used in recent studies of $g-2$ of the muon and in the proof
of non-renormalization theorems of the anomaly vertex. The poles extracted from
the L/T parameterization do not couple in the infrared for generic anomalous
vertices, as in Rosenberg, but we show that they are responsible for the
violations of unitarity in the UV region, using a class of pole-dominated
amplitudes. We conclude that consistent formulations of anomalous models
require necessarily the cancellation of these polar contributions. Establishing
the UV significance of these terms provides a natural bridge between the
anomalous effective action and its completion by a nonlocal theory. Some
additional difficulties with unitarity of the mechanism of inflow in extra
dimensional models with an anomalous theory on the brane, due to the presence
of anomaly poles, are also pointed out.

consistently with the stellar emission in our SED fitting tool and analyse
differentially a sample of 10 z~6 galaxies in the GOODS-S field studied earlier

observed in a number of z~6 galaxies detected at >~3.6 micron with IRAC/Spitzer
can be mimicked by the presence of strong restframe optical emission lines,
implying in particular younger ages than previously thought. Applying these
models to the small sample of z~6 galaxies, we find that this effect may lead
to a typical downward revision of their stellar ages by a factor ~3. In
consequence their average formation redshift may drastically be reduced, and
these objects may not have contributed to cosmic reionisation at z>6.
Extinction and stellar mass estimates may also be somewhat modified, but to a
lesser extent. Careful SED fits including nebular emission and treating
properly uncertainties and degeneracies are necessary for more accurate
determinations of the physical parameters of high-z galaxies.

imitation with another imitative rule. We find that, surprinsingly, in many

Quantum turbulence is studied in large grid numerical simulations: Kolmogorov
spectrum associated with a Richardson energy cascade occurs on large flow
scales. At intermediate scales a k^{-6} power law emerges, in a
classical-quantum transition from vortex filament reconnections to Kelvin
wave-acoustic wave coupling. The spontaneous exchange of intermediate vortex
rings is observed. Finally, at very small spatial scales a k^{-3} power law
emerges, characterizing fluid dynamics occurring within the scale size of the
vortex cores themselves, a characteristic Kelvin wave cascade region. Poincare
recurrence is studied: in the free non-interacting system, a fast Poincare
recurrence occurs for regular arrays of line vortices. The recurrence period is
used to demarcate dynamics driving the nonlinear quantum fluid towards
turbulence, since fast recurrence is an approximate symmetry of the nonlinear
quantum fluid at early times. This class of quantum algorithms is useful for
studying BEC superfluid dynamics over a broad range of wave numbers, from
quantum flow to a pseudo-classical inviscid flow regime to a Kolmogorov

molecular properties, which are of practical importance in fields ranging from
materials science to biochemistry. Within chemical precision, the total energy
of a molecule as well as most other properties, can be calculated by solving
the Schrodinger equation. However, the computational resources required to
obtain exact solutions on a conventional computer generally increase
exponentially with the number of atoms involved. This renders such calculations
intractable for all but the smallest of systems. Recently, an efficient
algorithm has been proposed enabling a quantum computer to overcome this
problem by achieving only a polynomial resource scaling with system size. Such
a tool would therefore provide an extremely powerful tool for new science and
technology. Here we present a photonic implementation for the smallest problem:
obtaining the energies of H2, the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We
perform a key algorithmic step - the iterative phase estimation algorithm - in
full, achieving a high level of precision and robustness to error. We implement
other algorithmic steps with assistance from a classical computer and explain
how this non-scalable approach could be avoided. Finally, we provide new
theoretical results which lay the foundations for the next generation of
simulation experiments using quantum computers. We have made early experimental
progress towards the long-term goal of exploiting quantum information to speed
up quantum chemistry calculations.

millimeters down to subnanometers. It is shown that even if the dielectric

Waals/Casimir forces. Especially when the liquid dielectric function becomes
comparable in magnitude to the dielectric function of one of the interacting

plate-plate separations 5-500 nm. This corresponds to an uncertainty up to 100%
in the theory prediction for a specific system. As a result accuracy testing of
the Lifshitz theory under these circumstances is rather questionable. Finally

traces out a filamentary structure in the early Universe at a redshift of z =
3.1 (equivalent to 15 per cent of the age of the Universe) and is believed to
mark a forming protocluster. Galaxies that are bright at (sub)millimetre
wavelengths are undergoing violent episodes of star formation, and there is
evidence that they are preferentially associated with high-redshift radio
galaxies, so the question of whether they are also associated with the most
significant large-scale structure growing at high redshift (as outlined by
Lyman-alpha emitters) naturally arises. Here we report an imaging survey of
1,100-um emission in the SSA 22 region. We find an enhancement of submillimetre
galaxies near the core of the protocluster, and a large-scale correlation
between the submillimetre galaxies and the low-mass Lyman-alpha emitters,
suggesting synchronous formation of the two very different types of
star-forming galaxy within the same structure at high redshift. These results
are in general agreement with our understanding of the formation of cosmic

is specifically tailored for the reading of superconducting flux qubits in an
integrated circuit that could enable adiabatic quantum optimization. In such a
system, the flux qubits only need to be read at the end of an adiabatic
evolution when quantum mechanical tunneling has been suppressed, thus
simplifying many aspects of the readout process. The readout architecture for
an $N$-qubit adiabatic quantum optimization system comprises $N$ hysteretic dc
SQUIDs and $N$ rf SQUID latches controlled by $2\sqrt{N} + 2$ bias lines. The
latching elements are coupled to the qubits and the dc SQUIDs are then coupled
to the latching elements. This readout scheme provides two key advantages:
First, the latching elements provide exceptional flux sensitivity that
significantly exceeds what may be achieved by directly coupling the flux qubits
to the dc SQUIDs using a practical mutual inductance. Second, the states of the
latching elements are robust against the influence of ac currents generated by
the switching of the hysteretic dc SQUIDs, thus allowing one to interrogate the
latching elements repeatedly so as to mitigate the effects of stochastic
switching of the dc SQUIDs. We demonstrate that it is possible to achieve
single qubit read error rates of $<10^{-6}$ with this readout scheme. We have
characterized the system-level performance of a 128-qubit readout system and
have measured a readout error probability of $8\times10^{-5}$ in the presence
of optimal latching element bias conditions.

which is related to the presence of short lived massive stars. Disc galaxies
show a strong cutoff in H$\alpha$ radiation at a certain galactocentric
distance which has led to the conclusion that star formation is suppressed in
the outer regions of disc galaxies. This is seemingly in contradiction to
recent UV observations (Boissier et al., 2007) that imply disc galaxies to have
star formation beyond the Halpha cutoff and that the star-formation-surface
density is linearly related to the underlying gas surface density being
shallower than derived from Halpha luminosities (Kennicutt, 1998). In a
galaxy-wide formulation the clustered nature of star formation has recently led
to the insight that the total galactic Halpha luminosity is non-linearly
related to the galaxy-wide star formation rate (Pflamm-Altenburg et al.,
2007d). Here we show that a local formulation of the concept of clustered star
formation naturally leads to a steeper radial decrease of the Halpha surface
luminosity than the star-formation-rate surface density in quantitative
agreement with the observations, and that the observed Halpha cutoff arises

flux exhibits an apparent anomaly, whereby this ratio increases between 10 and
100 GeV. In contrast, this ratio should decrease according to the standard
scenario, in which CR positrons are secondaries formed by hadronic interactions
between the primary CR protons and the interstellar medium (ISM). The positron
excess is therefore interpreted as evidence for either an annihilation/decay of
weakly interacting massive particles, or for a direct astrophysical source of
pairs. The common feature of all proposed models is that they invoke new
physics or new astrophysical sources. However, this line of argumentation
relies implicitly on the assumption of a relatively homogeneous CR source
distribution. Inhomogeneity of CR sources on a scale of order a kpc, can
naturally explain this anomaly. If the nearest major CR source is about a kpc
away, then low energy electrons (~GeV) can easily reach us. At higher energies
(> 10 GeV), the source electrons cool via synchrotron and inverse-Compton
before reaching the solar vicinity. Pairs formed in the local vicinity through
the proton/ISM interactions can reach the solar system also at high energies,
thus increasing the positron/electron ratio. A natural origin of source
inhomogeneity is the strong concentration of supernovae to the galactic spiral
arms. Assuming supernova remnants (SNRs) as the sole primary source of CRs, and
taking into account their concentration near the galactic spiral arms, we
consistently predict the observed positron fraction between 1 and 100 GeV,
while abiding to different constraints such as the observed electron spectrum
and the CRs cosmogenic age. An ATIC like spectral excess at ~600 GeV can be
explained, in this picture, as the contribution of a few known nearby SNRs.

significant detections of high energy emission have been reported only in six
Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) until now. In this work we show that the lack of
detection of a GeV spectrum excess in almost all GRBs, though somewhat
surprisingly, can be well understood within the standard internal shock model
and several alternatives like the photosphere-internal shock (gradual magnetic
dissipation) model and the magnetized internal shock model. The delay of the
arrival of the >100 MeV photons from some Fermi bursts can be interpreted too.
We then show that with the polarimetry of prompt emission these models may be
distinguishable. In the magnetized internal shock model, high linear
polarization level should be typical. In the standard internal shock model,
high linear polarization level is still possible but much less frequent. In the
photosphere-internal shock model, the linear polarization degree is expected to
be roughly anti-correlated with the weight of the photosphere/thermal
component, which may be a unique signature of this kind of model. We also
briefly discuss the implication of the current Fermi GRB data on the detection
prospect of the prompt PeV neutrinos. The influences of the intrinsic proton
spectrum and the enhancement of the neutrino number at some specific energies,
due to the cooling of pions (muons), are outlined.

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is a more comprehensive method to select
and distinguish poststarburst galaxies than the classical definition of
measuring equivalent widths of (Hdelta) and [OII] lines.
  In this paper we will carefully investigate this new method and evaluate it
by comparing our model grid of post-starburst galaxies to observed E+A galaxies
from the MORPHS catalog.
  We find that the post-starburst models can be distinguished from undisturbed
spiral, S0 and E galaxies and galaxies in their starburst phase on the basis of
their SEDs. It is even possible to distinguish most of the different
post-starburst by their SEDs. From the comparison with observations we find
that all observed E+A galaxies from the MORPHS catalog can be matched by our

formation rate are possible scenarios for the observed E+A galaxies in

raises the pairing transition temperature. As an illustration, we calculate the

the umbra -- because of the broken symmetry due to the inclined magnetic field.
The dark penumbral filament cores visible at high resolution are caused by the

established are the details of what determines the average luminosity of
penumbrae, the widths, lengths, and filling factors of penumbral filaments, and

depend at least partially also on numerical aspects such as limited resolution

that such debris appears as shells, isolated clumps and elongated

remaining frontier, where the first stars, galaxies, and massive black holes
formed. They fundamentally transformed the early Universe by endowing it with
the first sources of light and chemical elements beyond the primordial hydrogen
and helium produced in the Big Bang. The interplay of theory and upcoming
observations promises to answer the key open questions in this emerging field.

coronal loops would be an important step forward towards a more complete
understanding of the coronal heating problem. Following on from Sarkar & Walsh
(2008) this paper presents a short 10e9 cm ""global loop"" as 125 individual
strands, where each strand is modelled independently by a one-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation. The strands undergo small-scale episodic heating and
are coupled together through the frequency distribution of the total energy
input to the loop which follows a power law distribution with index ~ 2.29. The
spatial preference of the swarm of heating events from apex to footpoint is
investigated. From a theoretical perspective, the resulting emission measure
weighted temperature profiles along these two extreme cases does demonstrate a
possible observable difference. Subsequently, the simulated output is folded
through the TRACE instrument response functions and a re-derivation of the
temperature using different filter-ratio techniques is performed. Given the
multi-thermal scenario created by this many strand loop model, a broad
differential emission measure results; the subsequent double and triple filter
ratios are very similar to those obtained from observations. However, any
potential observational signature to differentiate between apex and footpoint
dominant heating is possibly below instrumental thresholds. The consequences of
using a broadband instrument like TRACE and Hinode-XRT in this way are
discussed.

distributions is considered. Chow and Liu established that ML-estimation
reduces to the construction of a maximum-weight spanning tree using the
empirical mutual information quantities as the edge weights. Using the theory
of large-deviations, we analyze the exponent associated with the error
probability of the event that the ML-estimate of the Markov tree structure
differs from the true tree structure, given a set of independently drawn
samples. By exploiting the fact that the output of ML-estimation is a tree, we
establish that the error exponent is equal to the exponential rate of decay of
a single dominant crossover event. We prove that in this dominant crossover
event, a non-neighbor node pair replaces a true edge of the distribution that
is along the path of edges in the true tree graph connecting the nodes in the
non-neighbor pair. Using ideas from Euclidean information theory, we then
analyze the scenario of ML-estimation in the very noisy learning regime and
show that the error exponent can be approximated as a ratio, which is
interpreted as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for learning tree distributions.
We show via numerical experiments that in this regime, our SNR approximation is
accurate.

template carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on a macroscopic dimension. The nematic
director field, coupled to the dispersed CNT long-axis, enables controlled
director reorientation using well-established methods of LC alignment
techniques, such as patterned-electrode-surface, electric fields, and magnetic
fields. Electric field induced director rotation of a nematic LC+CNT system is
of potential interests due to its possible applications as a nano
electromechanical system. The relaxation mechanism for a LC+CNT composite, on
the removal of the applied field, reveals the intrinsic dynamics of this
anisotropic system. Dielectric hysteresis and temperature dependence of the
dielectric constant coherently shows the ferroelectric-type behavior of the
LC+CNT system in the nematic phase. The strong surface anchoring of LC
molecules on CNT walls results in forming local isolated pseudo-nematic domains
in the isotropic phase. These domains, being anisotropic, respond to external
fields, but, do not relax back to the original state on switching of the field
off, showing non-volatile memory effect.

then empirically measure these quantities on two real life folksonomies, the

in chains with Lorentzian disorder is shown to manifest itself in the disorder
scaling of the localization length distribution. Also, we show that the local
exciton level structure of the Lifshits tail differs substantially for these
two types of disorder: In addition to the singlets and doublets of localized
states near the bare band edge, strongly resembling those found for Gaussian
disorder, for Lorentzian disorder two other types of states are found in this

the same chain segment and isolated states localized on short segments.
Finally, below the Lifshits tail, Lorentzian disorder induces strongly
localized exciton states, centered around low energy sites, with localization
properties that strongly depend on energy. For Gaussian disorder with a
magnitude that does not exceed the exciton bandwidth, the likelihood to find
such very deep states is exponentially small.

of NLTE radiative transfer calculations of the BaII 4554 A line in a

cases of spatially unsmeared profiles and the profiles smeared to the
resolution of ground-based observations. We find that: (i)
Speckle-reconstructed Dopplergram velocities reproduce the ``true'' velocities
well at heights around 300 km, except for intergranular lanes with strong
downflows where the velocity can be overestimated. (ii) The lambda-meter
velocities give a good representation of the ``true'' velocities through the
whole photosphere, both under the original and reduced spatial resolutions. The
velocities derived from the inner wing of smeared BaII 4554 A line profiles are
more reliable than those for the outer wing. Only under high spatial resolution
does the inner wing velocities calculated in intergranular regions give an
underestimate (or even a sign reversal) compared with the model velocities.
(iii) NLTE effects should be taken into account in modelling the BaII 4554 A
line profiles. Such effects are more pronounced in intergranular regions. Our
analysis supports the opinion that the Dopplergram technique applied to the
BaII 4554 A line is a valuable tool for the Doppler diagnostics of the middle
photosphere around 300 km. The \lambda-meter technique applied to this line
gives us a good opportunity to ``trace'' the non-thermal motions along the
whole photosphere up to the temperature minimum and lower chromosphere.

average coordination, of completely disordered solids with spherical
constituents, from ca. 55% volume fraction up to random close packing, in the
absence of structural heterogeneities. Based on the current understanding,
according to which the structure-determining interaction in amorphous solids is
the hard-core repulsion while weaker, longer-range interactions are mere
perturbations, the model yields the average coordination in the solid as a
result of a hyperquenching process where the instantaneous structure of the
precursor liquid snapshot is distorted to the same degree required to quench
the hard-sphere liquid into the isostatic jammed state at 64% volume fraction.
The characteristic length of distortion turns out to be about 3% of the
particle diameter. Extrapolating to lower volume fractions, this is thus the
quenching route leading to the most spatially homogeneous states. Thus the
model can be usefully employed to quantitatively assess the degree of
structural inhomogeneity in amorphous solids. When spatial inhomogeneity is
small, as for very dense systems, the model can be used to evaluate
coordination-dependent macroscopic properties (e.g. the elastic moduli) as
shown in parallel works.

relatively few examples of studies on their interactions in epidemiological

understanding and description of gene-environment interaction. To this aim, a
possible strategy is to challenge the different statistical methods against

(NCG), which allows to unify two of the basic theories of modern physics:
General Relativity (GR) and the Standard Model (SM) of Particle Physics as
classical field theories. In the noncommutative framework the Higgs boson,
which had previously to be put in by hand, and many of the ad hoc features of
the standard model appear in a natural way.
  The aim of this presentation is to motivate this unification from basic
physical principles and to give a flavour of its derivation. One basic
prediction of the noncommutative approach to the SM is that the mass of the
Higgs Boson should be of the order of 170 GeV if one assumes the Big Desert.
This mass range is with reasonable probability excluded by the Tevatron and
therefore it is interesting to investigate models beyond the SM that are
compatible with NCG. Going beyond the SM is highly non-trivial within the NCG
approach but possible extensions have been found and provide for
phenomenologically interesting models. We will present in this article a short
introduction into the NCG framework and describe one of these extensions of the
SM. This model contains new scalar bosons (and fermions) which constitute a

Chern-Simons dynamics is a Galileo invariant evolution for A, which is an
interesting alternative to the Lorentz invariant Maxwell evolution, and is
finding increasing numbers of applications in two dimensional condensed matter
field theory. The system we study, introduced by Manton, is a special case (for
constant external magnetic field, and a point interaction) of the effective
field theory of Zhang, Hansson and Kivelson arising in studies of the
fractional quantum Hall effect. From the mathematical perspective the system is
a natural gauge invariant generalization of the nonlinear Schroedinger
equation, which is also Galileo invariant and admits a self-dual structure with
a resulting large space of topological solitons (the moduli space of self-dual
Ginzburg-Landau vortices). We prove a theorem describing the adiabatic
approximation of this system by a Hamiltonian system on the moduli space. The
approximation holds for values of the Higgs self-coupling constant close to the
self-dual (Bogomolny) value of 1. The viability of the approximation scheme
depends upon the fact that self-dual vortices form a symplectic submanifold of
the phase space (modulo gauge invariance). The theorem provides a rigorous
description of slow vortex dynamics in the near self-dual limit.

derive mass loss rates of ~10^{-9} M_sun/yr, typically a factor 2-10 times
lower than the corresponding rates in our previous work (Ercolano et al., 2008)

somewhat lower rates, and the fact that mass loss is concentrated towards
slightly smaller radii, result from the puffing up of the heated disc at a few
AU which partially screens the disc at tens of AU. (.....) We highlight the
fact that X-ray photoevaporation has two generic advantages for disc dispersal

enhance phase-diffusion. In comparison, site-indiscriminate noise measuring the
population imbalance between the two quasi-momentum modes, slows down the loss

phase-diffusion, depending on the details of system-bath coupling and the
overlap of decoherence pointer states with collisional-entanglement pointer
states. The deceleration of phase-diffusion due to the coupling with the

enhanced with increasing number of particles $N$, by a bosonic factor of

the energy requirements in a semi-empirical atmosphere model. We analyzed a
1-hour time series and a large-area map of Ca II H spectra on the traces of
propagating waves. We analyzed the velocity statistics of several spectral
lines in the wing of Ca II H, and the line-core velocity of Ca II H. We
converted the velocity amplitudes into volume and mass energy densities. For
comparison, we used the increase of internal energy necessary to lift a RE
atmosphere to the HSRA temperature stratification. We find that the velocity
amplitude grows in agreement with linear wave theory and thus slower with
height than predicted from energy conservation. The mechanical energy of the
waves above around z~500 km is insufficient to maintain the chromospheric
temperature rise in the semi-empirical HSRA model. The intensity variations of
the Ca line core (z~1000 km) can be traced back to the velocity variations of
the lowermost forming spectral line considered (z~ 250 km). The chromospheric

spin-$s_1$ operators $\bf{S_{1i}}$ at the sublattice $A$ site and spin-$s_2$
operators $\bf{S_{2i}}$ at the sublattice $B$ site, is considered. Renormalized
spin-wave theory, which accounts for the magnon-magnon interaction, and its
extension are developed to describe the two ferrimagnetic phases $(0,T^*)$ and
$(T^*,T_N)$ in the system, and to calculate the magnetization as a function of
temperature.
  The influence of the parameters in the theory on the characteristic
temperatures $T_N$ and $T^*$ is studied. It is shown that, increasing the
inter-sublattice exchange interaction, the ratio $T_N/T^*>1$ decreases
approaching one, and above some critical value of the exchange constant there
is only one phase $T_N = T^*$, and the magnetization-temperature curve has the
typical Curie-Weiss profile. When the intra-exchange constant of sublattice
with stronger intra-exchange interaction increases the $Ne\grave{e}l$
temperature increases while $T^*$ remains unchanged. Finally, when the magnetic
order of the sublattice with smaller magnetic order decreases, $T^*$ decreases.
The theoretical predictions are utilize to interpret the experimentally
measured magnetization-temperature curves.

first detection of IRAS 19254-7245 above 10 keV, and measured a 15-30 keV flux
of ~5x10^(-12) erg cm^-2 s^-1. The detection above 10 keV has allowed us to
unveil, for the first time, the intrinsic luminosity of the AGN hosted in IRAS
19254-7245, which is strongly absorbed (Nh ~ 3x10^(24) cm^-2) and has an
intrinsic luminosity in the QSO regime (L(2-10 keV) ~ 3 x 10^(44) erg s^-1).
The 2-10 keV spectrum of IRAS 19254-7245 is remarkably hard (Gamma~1.2), and
presents a strong iron line (EW ~0.7 keV), clearly suggesting that below 10 keV
we are seeing only reprocessed radiation. Since the energy of the Fe K emission
is found to be at ~6.7 keV, consistent with He-like Fe, and its EW is too high
to be explained in a starburst dominated scenario, we suggest that the 2--10
keV emission of IRAS 19254-7245 is dominated by reflection/scattering from
highly ionized matter. Indeed, within this latter scenario we found that the
photon index of the illuminating source is Gamma=1.87 (+0.11,-0.28), in
excellent agreement with the mean value found for radio quiet unobscured AGN.

background source. We survey N V absorption in a sample of 91 DLAs and 18
sub-DLAs in the redshift range 1.67<z<4.28 with unblended coverage of the N V
doublet, using data from VLT/UVES, Keck/HIRES, and Keck/ESI. In DLAs, we find
eight secure N V detections, four marginal detections, and 79 non-detections.
The detection rate of N V in DLAs is therefore 13^{+5}_{-4}%. Two sub-DLA N V
detections are found among a sample of 18, at a similar detection rate of
11^{+15}_{-7}%. We show that the N V detection rate is a strong function of
metallicity, increasing by a factor of ~4 at [N/H]=[NI/HI]>-2.3. The N V and
CIV component b-value distributions in DLAs are statistically similar, but the
median b(N V) of 18 km/s is lower than the median b(O VI) of 25 km/s. Some ~20%
of the N V components have b<10 km/s and thus arise in warm photoionized plasma
at log (T/K)<4.92; local sources of ionizing radiation (as opposed to the
extragalactic background) are required to keep the cloud sizes physically
reasonable. The nature of the remaining ~80% of (broad) N V components is
unclear; models of radiatively-cooling collisionally-ionized plasma at
log(T/K)=5.2-5.4 are fairly successful in reproducing the observed integrated
high-ion column density ratios and the component line widths, but we cannot
rule out photoionization by local sources. Finally, we identify several unusual
DLAs with extremely low metallicity (<0.01 solar) but strong high-ion

allowing both Dirac and Majorana gauginos. The Dirac masses are obtained by
pairing up extra chiral multiplets: a singlet S for U(1)_Y, a triplet T for
SU(2) and an octet O for SU(3) with the respective gauginos. The electroweak
symmetry breaking sector is modified by the couplings of the new fields S and T
to the Higgs doublets. We discuss two limits: i) both the adjoint scalars are
decoupled with the main effect being the modification of the Higgs quartic
coupling; ii) the singlet remaining light, and due to its direct coupling to
sfermions, providing a new contribution to the soft masses and inducing new
decay/production channels. We discuss the LSP in this scenario; after
mentioning the possibility that it may be a Dirac gravitino, we focus on the
case where it is identified with the lightest neutralino, and exhibit
particular values of the parameter space where the relic density is in
agreement with WMAP data. This is illustrated for different scenarios where the
LSP is either a bino (in which case it can be a Dirac fermion) or
bino-higgsino/wino mixtures. We also point out in each case the peculiarity of
the model with respect to dark matter detection experiments.

  The full version is submitted to a journal",,,,"cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Finite-turn pushdown automata (PDA) are investigated concerning their
descriptional complexity. It is known that they accept exactly the class of
ultralinear context-free languages. Furthermore, the increase in size when
converting arbitrary PDAs accepting ultralinear languages to finite-turn PDAs
cannot be bounded by any recursive function. The latter phenomenon is known as
non-recursive trade-off. In this paper, finite-turn PDAs accepting bounded
languages are considered. First, letter-bounded languages are studied. We prove
that in this case the non-recursive trade-off is reduced to a recursive
trade-off, more precisely, to an exponential trade-off. A conversion algorithm
is presented and the optimality of the construction is shown by proving tight
lower bounds. Furthermore, the question of reducing the number of turns of a
given finite-turn PDA is studied. Again, a conversion algorithm is provided
which shows that in this case the trade-off is at most polynomial. Finally, the
more general case of word-bounded languages is investigated. We show how the
results obtained for letter-bounded languages can be extended to word-bounded
languages.

dielectric bodies as formulated by Dzyaloshinskii, Lifshitz, and Pitaevskii is
rewritten as a perturbation theory in terms of the spatial contrast in
(imaginary) frequency dependent dielectric function. The formulation can be
used to calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz forces for dielectric objects of
arbitrary geometry, as a perturbative expansion in the dielectric contrast, and
could thus complement the existing theories that use perturbation in
geometrical features. We find that expansion in dielectric contrast recasts the
resulting Lifshitz energy into a sum of the different many-body contributions.
The limit of validity and convergence properties of the perturbation theory is
discussed using the example of parallel semi-infinite objects for which the
exact result is known.

around S-type AGB stars. The S stars produce dust in their wind that bears a
resemblance to the dust produced in some O-rich AGB stars. However, the
reported resemblance is mostly based on IRAS/LRS spectra with limited spectral
resolution, sensitivity, and wavelength coverage. We investigate the dust
composition around S stars using ISO/SWS data that surpass the previous studies
in terms of spectral resolution and wavelength coverage. We compare the dust
spectra from the 9 sources with the O-rich AGB spectra and a subset of M
super-giants. We constructed average dust emission spectra of the different
categories. We report the discovery of several previously unreported dust
emission features in the S star spectra. The long wavelength spectra of W Aql
and pi1 Gru exhibit the ""30"" micrometer feature attributed to MgS. Two sources
exhibit a series of emission bands between 20 and 40 micrometer that we
tentatively ascribe to Diopside. We show that the 10-20 micrometer spectra of
the S stars are significantly different from the O-rich AGB stars. The O-rich
stars exhibit a structured emission feature that is believed to arise from
amorphous silicate and aluminium-oxide. The S stars lack the substructure found
in the O-rich stars. Instead they show a smooth peak with a varying
peak-position from source to source. We suggest that this feature is caused by
a family of related material, whose exact composition determines the peak
position. The observed trend mimics the laboratory trend of non-stoichiometric
silicates. In this scenario the degree of non-stoichiometry is related to the
Mg to SiO4 ratio, in other words, to the amount of free O available during the
dust grain growth.

solving systems of nonlinear equations. The new hypersecant Jacobian
approximation is intended for the special case where the evaluation of the
functions whose roots are sought dominates the computation time, and
additionally the Jacobian is sparse. One example of such a case is the solution
of the discretized transport equation to calculate particle and energy fluxes
in a fusion plasma. The hypersecant approximation of the Jacobian is calculated
using function values from previous Newton iterations, similarly to the Broyden
approximation. Unlike Broyden, the hypersecant Jacobian converges to the
finite-difference approximation of the Jacobian. The calculation of the
hypersecant Jacobian elements requires solving small, dense linear systems,
where the coefficient matrices can be ill-conditioned or even exactly singular.
Singular-value decomposition (SVD) is therefore used. Convergence comparisons
of the hypersecant method, the standard Broyden method, and the colored finite
differencing of the PETSc SNES solver are presented.

plus the two nuclei is L_IR = 3.8x10^10 L_o, with their derived star formation
rates ranging between 0.2 and 2 M_o/yr, with a total of 6.6 M_o/yr. The hardest
and most luminous radiation originates from two compact clusters in the
southern part of the overlap region, which also have the highest dust
temperatures. PAH emission and other tracers of softer radiation are spatially
extended throughout and beyond the overlap region, but regions with harder and
intenser radiation field show a reduced PAH strength. The strong H_2 emission
is rather confined around the nucleus of NGC 4039, where shocks appear to be
the dominant excitation mechanism, and the southern part of the overlap region,
where it traces the most recent starburst activity. The luminosity ratio
between the warm molecular gas (traced by the H_2 lines) and the total far-IR
emission is ~1.6x10^-4, similar to that found in many starburst and ULIRGs. The
total mass of warm H_2 in the Antennae is 2.5x10^7 M_o, with a fraction of warm
to total H_2 gas mass of about 0.35%. The average warm H_2 temperature is
302+/-26 K and appears anti-correlated with the radiation field hardness,
possibly due to an evolution of the PDR morphology. The previously reported
tight correlation between the H_2 and PAH emission was not found but higher
total PAH emission to continuum ratios were found in PDRs with warmer gas.
