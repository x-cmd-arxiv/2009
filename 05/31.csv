the fact that when an integrable system, such as the system that describes
geodesic orbits in a Kerr spacetime, is perturbed, the tori in phase space
which initially corresponded to resonances disintegrate so as to form the so
called Birkhoff chains on a surface of section, according to the
Poincar\'{e}-Birkhoff theorem. The KAM curves of these islands in such a chain
share the same ratio of frequencies, even though the frequencies themselves
vary from one KAM curve to another inside an island. On the other hand, the KAM
curves, which do not lie in a Birkhoff chain, do not share this characteristic

associated to three different tidal coefficients: (i) a gravito-electric-type

multipolar moment GM_{a_1... a_\ell} induced in a star by an external
\ell^{th}-order gravito-electric tidal field G_{a_1... a_\ell}; (ii) a

\ell^{th} spin multipole moment G S_{a_1... a_\ell} induced in a star by an
external \ell^{th}-order gravito-magnetic tidal field H_{a_1... a_\ell}; and
(iii) a dimensionless ``shape'' Love number h_\ell measuring the distortion of
the shape of the surface of a star by an external \ell^{th}-order
gravito-electric tidal field. All the dimensionless tidal coefficients
G\mu_\ell/R^{2\ell+1}, G\sigma_\l/R^{2\ell+1} and h_\ell (where R is the radius
of the star) are found to have a strong sensitivity to the value of the star's
``compactness'' c\equiv GM/(c_0^2 R) (where we indicate by c_0 the speed of
light). In particular, G\mu_\l/R^{2\l+1}\sim k_\ell is found to strongly
decrease, as c increases, down to a zero value as c is formally extended to the
``black-hole (BH) limit'' c^{BH}=1/2. The shape Love number h_\ell is also
found to significantly decrease as c increases, though it does not vanish in
the formal limit c\to c^{BH}. The formal vanishing of \mu_\ell and \sigma_\ell
as c\to c^{BH} is a consequence of the no-hair properties of black holes; this
suggests, but in no way proves, that the effective action describing the
gravitational interactions of black holes may not need to be augmented by
nonminimal worldline couplings.

the particles. Our model provides a criterion of distance for identifying in
which cases a common environment can induce entanglement. Three regimes are
found: the short distance regime, equivalent to a bilinear system-reservoir

(PWB) is the father of modern high-pressure physics. What is not generally
recognized is that Bridgman was also intimately connected with establishing
shock compression as a scientific tool and he predicted major events in shock
research that occurred up to 40 years after his death. In 1956 the first phase
transition under shock compression was reported in Fe at 13 GPa (130 kbar). PWB
said a phase transition could not occur in a ~microsec, thus setting off a
controversy. The scientific legitimacy of shock compression resulted 5 years
later when static high-pressure researchers confirmed with x-ray diffraction
the existence of epsilon-Fe. Once PWB accepted the fact that shock waves
generated with chemical explosives were a valid scientific tool, he immediately
realized that substantially higher pressures would be achieved with nuclear
explosives. He included his ideas for achieving higher pressures in articles
published a few years after his death. L. V. Altshuler eventually read Bridgman
articles and pursued the idea of using nuclear explosives to generate super
high pressures, which subsequently morphed today into giant lasers. PWB also
anticipated combining static and shock methods, which today is done with
pre-compression of a soft sample in a diamond anvil cell followed by
laser-driven shock compression. One variation of that method is the
reverberating-shock technique, in which the first shock pre-compresses a soft
sample and subsequent reverberations isentropically compress the first-shocked
state.

Sauro","An Optimization Algorithm for Finding Parameters for Bistability","5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"q-bio.MN q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivation: Many biochemical pathways are known, but the numerous parameters
required to correctly explore the dynamics of the pathways are not known. For
this reason, algorithms that can make inferences by looking at the topology of
a network are desirable. In this work, we are particular interested in the
question of whether a given pathway can potentially harbor multiple stable
steady states. In other words, the challenge is to find the set of parameters
such that the dynamical system defined by a set of ordinary differential
equations will contain multiple stable steady states. Being able to find
parameters that cause a network to be bistable may also be benefitial for
engineering synthetic bistable systems where the engineer needs to know a
working set of parameters.
  Result: We have developed an algorithm that optimizes the parameters of a
dynamical system so that the system will contain at least one saddle or
unstable point. The algorithm then looks at trajectories around this saddle or
unstable point to see whether the different trajectories converge to different
stable points. The algorithm returns the parameters that causes the system to
exhibit multiple stable points. Since this is an optimization algorithm, it is
not quaranteed to find a solution. Repeated runs are often required to find a

proteins, analyzing the structure of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
could explain complex biological mechanisms, evolution, and disease. Similarly,
studying protein structure networks, residue interaction graphs (RIGs), might
provide insights into protein folding, stability, and function. The first step
towards understanding these networks is finding an adequate network model that
closely replicates their structure. Evaluating the fit of a model to the data
requires comparing the model with real-world networks. Since network
comparisons are computationally infeasible, they rely on heuristics, or
""network properties."" We show that it is difficult to assess the reliability of
the fit of a model with any individual network property. Thus, our approach
integrates a variety of network properties and further combines these with a
series of probabilistic methods to predict an appropriate network model for
biological networks. We find geometric random graphs, that model spatial
relationships between objects, to be the best-fitting model for RIGs. This
validates the correctness of our method, since RIGs have previously been shown
to be geometric. We apply our approach to noisy PPI networks and demonstrate
that their structure is also consistent with geometric random graphs.

that the fraction of hard X-ray luminosity (log$(L_{\rm 2-10 kev}/L_{\rm
bol})$) decreases with the increase of Eddington ratio. We also find that the
fraction of hard X-ray luminosity is independent on the black hole mass for the
radio-quiet AGNs. The relation of log$(L_{\rm 2-10 kev}/L_{\rm bol})$
decreasing with increasing Eddington ratio indicates that X-ray bolometric
correction is not a constant, from a larger sample supporting the results of
Vasudevan & Fabian (2007). We interpret our results by the disk corona
evaporation/condensation model (Meyer et al. \cite{me200}; Liu et al. 2002a;
Liu et al. 2007). In the frame of this model, the Compton cooling becomes
efficient in cooling of the corona at high accretion rate (in units of
Eddington rate), leading to condensation of corona gas to the disk.
Consequently, the relative strength of corona to the disk becomes weaker at
higher Eddington ratio. Therefore, the fraction of hard X-ray emission to disk
emission and hence to the bolometric emission is smaller at higher Eddington
ratio. The independence of the fraction of hard X-ray luminosity on the mass of
the black hole can also be explained by the disk corona model since the corona
structure and luminosity (in units of Eddington luminosity) are independent on
the mass of black holes.

list of lines. A number of atomic transition algorithms and analytical
techniques are implemented within the program and can be very useful in various
situations. The program can be described as fast and efficient. Moreover, it

related to the so-called {\it ideal tracer particles}. The latter, which can in
principle be permitted to have arbitrary initial velocities, are understood as
particles of infinitesimal size which do not produce significant perturbations
of the fluid and do not interact among themselves. An unsolved theoretical
problem is the correct definition of their dynamics in ideal fluids. The issue
is relevant in order to exhibit the connection between fluid dynamics and the
classical dynamical system, underlying a prescribed fluid system, which
uniquely generates its time-evolution. \
  The goal of this paper is to show that the tracer-particle dynamics can be
{\it exactly} established for an arbitrary incompressible fluid uniquely based
on the construction of an inverse kinetic theory (IKT) (Tessarotto \textit{et
al.}, 2000-2008). As an example, the case of an incompressible Newtonian
thermofluid is here considered.

neutrinos can be governed by a new resonance in the oscillation amplitude. This
resonance results when cancelation occurs between two phase differences, the
usual kinematic one coming from the neutrino mass-squared difference, and a
geometric one coming from the difference in travel times of the sterile
neutrino through the bulk relative to the active neutrino confined to the
brane. In this work we introduce a specific metric for the brane-bulk system,
from which we explicitly derive extra-dimensional geodesics for the sterile
neutrino, and ultimately the oscillation probability of the active-sterile
two-state system. We find that for an asymmetrically-warped metric, the
resonance condition involves both the neutrino energy E and the travel distance
L on the brane. In other words, the resonant energy may be viewed as
baseline-dependent. We show that to a good approximation, the resonance
condition is not on E or on L, but rather on the product LE. The model is rich
in implications, including the possibility of multiple solutions to the
resonance condition, with ramifications for existing data sets, e.g., LSND and
MiniBooNE. Some phenomenology with these brane-bulk resonances is discussed.

algebra and its nilpotent element. This paper concentrates on the study of
1-dimensional representations of these algebras. Under some conditions on a
nilpotent element (satisfied by all rigid elements) we obtain a criterium for a
finite dimensional module to have dimension 1. It is stated in terms of the
Brundan-Goodwin-Kleshchev highest weight theory. This criterium allows to
compute highest weights for certain completely prime primitive ideals in
universal enveloping algebras. We make an explicit computation in a special
case in type $E_8$. Our second principal result is a version of a parabolic
induction for W-algebras. In this case, the parabolic induction is an exact
functor between the categories of finite dimensional modules for two different
W-algebras. The most important feature of the functor is that it preserves
dimensions. In particular, it preserves one-dimensional representations. A
closely related result was obtained previously by Premet. We also establish
some other properties of the parabolic induction functor.
