the Hamiltonian constraint is not a local equation satisfied at each spatial
point but an equation integrated over a whole space. The global Hamiltonian
constraint is less restrictive than its local version, and allows a richer set
of solutions than in general relativity. We show that a component which behaves
like pressureless dust emerges as an ""integration constant"" of dynamical
equations and momentum constraint equations. Consequently, classical solutions
to the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity can mimic general relativity
plus cold dark matter.

obtain the optimal solution to a given problem in a systematic and efficient
way. For example, in twice-differentiable functions and problems with no
constraints, the optimization consists of finding the points where the gradient
of the objective function is zero and using the Hessian matrix to classify the
type of each point. Sometimes, however it is impossible to compute these
derivatives and other type of techniques must be employed such as the steepest
descent/ascent method and more sophisticated methods such as those based on the
evolutionary algorithms. Aims. We present a simple algorithm based on the idea
of genetic algorithms (GA) for optimization. We refer to this algorithm as AGA
(Asexual Genetic Algorithm) and apply it to two kinds of problems: the
maximization of a function where classical methods fail and model fitting in
astronomy. For the latter case, we minimize the chi-square function to estimate
the parameters in two examples: the orbits of exoplanets by taking a set of
radial velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) observed
towards a YSO (Young Stellar Object). Methods. The algorithm AGA may also be
called genetic, although it differs from standard genetic algorithms in two
main aspects: a) the initial population is not encoded, and b) the new
generations are constructed by asexual reproduction. Results. Applying our
algorithm in optimizing some complicated functions, we find the global maxima
within a few iterations. For model fitting to the orbits of exoplanets and the
SED of a YSO, we estimate the parameters and their associated errors.

fast horizontal plasma motions in quiet Sun granules. Their visibility
increases toward the limb due to more favorable viewing conditions. At the
resolution of Hinode, the horizontal flows give rise to asymmetric intensity
profiles with very inclined blue wings and even line satellites located
blueward of the main absorption feature. Doppler shifts of up to 9 km/s are
observed at the edges of bright granules, demonstrating that the flows reach
supersonic speeds. The strongest velocities occur in patches of 0.5 arcsec or
less. They tend to be associated with enhanced continuum intensities, line
widths, and equivalent widths, but large values of these parameters do not
necessarily imply the existence of supersonic flows. Time series of
spectropolarimetric measurements in regions away from disk center show the
transient nature of the strong horizontal motions, which last only for a
fraction of the granule lifetime. Supersonic flows are expected to produce
shocks at the boundaries between granules and intergranular lanes, and may also
play a role in the emergence of small-scale magnetic fields in quiet Sun

recent theoretical results suggest that this complexity may only be in the
worst-case since manipulation is often easy in practice. In this paper, we show
that empirical studies are useful in improving our understanding of this issue.
We demonstrate that there is a smooth transition in the probability that a
coalition can elect a desired candidate using the veto rule as the size of the
manipulating coalition increases. We show that a rescaled probability curve
displays a simple and universal form independent of the size of the problem. We
argue that manipulation of the veto rule is asymptotically easy for many
independent and identically distributed votes even when the coalition of
manipulators is critical in size. Based on this argument, we identify a
situation in which manipulation is computationally hard. This is when votes are
highly correlated and the election is ""hung"". We show, however, that even a
single uncorrelated voter is enough to make manipulation easy again.

statistical noise and cosmic variance against signal amplitude. We find that

macroscopic systems to prepare nearly Heisenberg-Limited quantum states through
a continuous measurement, i.e. conditioning. In order to probe the conditional
quantum state and confirm quantum dynamics, we propose use of an optimal
time-domain variational measurement, in which the homodyne detection phase
varies in time. This protocol allows us to characterize the macroscopic quantum
state below the Heisenberg Uncertainty -- i.e. Quantum Tomography -- and the
only limitation comes from readout loss which enters in a similar manner as the
frequency-domain variational scheme proposed by Kimble et al.. In the case of
no readout loss, it is identical to the back-action-evading scheme invented by
Vyatchanin et al. for detecting gravitational-wave (GW) signal with known
arrival time. As a special example and to motivate Macroscopic Quantum
Mechanics (MQM) experiments with future GW detectors, we mostly focus on the
free-mass limit -- the characteristic measurement frequency is much higher than
the oscillator frequency -- and further assume the classical noises are
Markovian, which captures the main feature of a broadband GW detector. Besides,
we consider verifications of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type entanglements
between macroscopic test masses in GW detectors, which enables to test one
particular version of Gravity Decoherence conjectured by Diosi and Penrose.

curves and spectra of tidal flares as a function of time, highlighting the
unique signatures of tidal flares in the optical and near-IR. Some of the gas
initially bound to the BH is likely blown away when the fallback rate is
super-Eddington at early times. This outflow produces an optical luminosity
comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ~10 days and
may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of
galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes
onto the BH via a thin disk whose emission peaks in the UV to soft X-rays. Some
of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a
spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden
lines). These lines are strongest for BHs with MBH ~ 10^5 - 10^6 Msun and thus
optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass BHs in galactic
nuclei. Calibrating our models to ROSAT and GALEX observations, we predict
detection rates for Pan-STARRS, PTF, and LSST and highlight observational
challenges in the optical. Pan-STARRS should detect at least several events per

the total mass of the planets. For system masses exceeding about one Jupiter
mass the final eccentricity distribution remains broad, whereas for lower mass
planetary systems a combination of divergent orbital evolution and
recircularization of scattered planets results in a preponderance of nearly
circular final orbits. We also study the fate of marginally stable multiple
planet systems in the presence of planetesimal disks, and find that for high

variations of 15-30%, with the largest relative changes occuring at the reddest

out a principal component analysis of the multi-band light curves; this
analysis reveals that 98% of the diurnal color changes of Earth are due to only
2 dominant eigencolors. We use the time-variations of these two eigencolors to
construct longitudinal maps of the Earth, treating it as a non-uniform Lambert
sphere. We find that the spectral and spatial distributions of the eigencolors
correspond to cloud-free continents and oceans; this despite the fact that our
observations were taken on days with typical cloud cover. We also find that the
near-infrared wavebands are particularly useful in distinguishing between land

globular clusters (GCs) become preferentially depleted in low-mass stars, which
have a high mass-to-light ratio. This has been shown to result in a

more massive GCs have lost a smaller fraction of their stars than low-mass GCs.

loss rate. Below the peak, the logarithmic slope of the GCMF is shallower than

of model clusters, created by assuming a polytropic equation of state
(Gamma=1.2) and hydrostatic equilibrium inside gravitational potential wells
drawn from a dark matter simulation. Star formation, energy input, and
nonthermal pressure support are included. To match the gas fractions seen in
non-radiative hydrodynamical simulations, roughly 5% of the binding energy of
the dark matter must be transferred to the gas during cluster formation; the
presence of nonthermal pressure support increases this value. In order to match
X-ray observations, scale-free behavior must be broken. This can be due to
either variation of the efficiency of star formation with cluster mass M_500,
or the input of additional energy proportional to the formed stellar mass M_F.
These two processes have similar effects on X-ray scalings. If 9% of the gas is
converted into stars, independent of cluster mass, then feedback energy input
of 1.2e-5*M_Fc^2 (or ~1.0 keV per particle) is required to match observed
clusters. Alternatively, if the stellar mass fraction varies as M_500^-0.26
then a lower feedback of 4e-6*M_Fc^2 is needed, and if the stellar fraction
varies as steeply as M_500^-0.49 then no additional feedback is necessary. The
model clusters reproduce the observed trends of gas temperature and gas mass
fraction with cluster mass, as well as observed entropy and pressure profiles;
thus they provide a calibrated basis with which to interpret upcoming SZ
surveys. One consequence of the increased gas energy is that the baryon
fraction inside the virial radius is less than roughly 90% of the cosmic mean,
even for the most massive clusters.

Besides a powerlaw with fixed index, an additional thermal blackbody of 114 eV

all the variability is caused by highly variable absorption columns in the

almost all observations reveals that dense, cool material is present not only
in the outer regions of the disk but interspersed throughout the disk. Most
spectra show strong line emission stemming from a photoionized accretion disk
corona. We model the line emission with generic thermal plasma models as well

ionization balance with orbital and superorbital phases. Most accretion disk
coronal properties such as disk radii, temperatures, and plasma densities are

varying cross-section in the other direction. We apply the standard long-wave
asymptotic analysis in the narrow dimension and show that the leading order
term is equivalent to that obtained previously from a direct extension of the
Fick-Jacobs approximation. We also show that the confining potential has
similar effects on the transport of Brownian particles to those induced by a
solid channel. Finally, we compare the analytical results with Brownian
dynamics simulations in the case of a sinusoidal variation of the width of the
parabolic potential in the cross-section. We obtain excellent agreement for the
marginal probability distribution, the average velocity of the Brownian
particles and the asymptotic dispersion coefficient, over a wide range of
Peclet numbers.

superconductors, displays unusual magnetic order and structural transitions.
Here we explore the idea that strong correlations may play an important role in
these materials. We argue that the unusual orders observed in FeTe can be
understood from a picture of correlated local moments with orbital degeneracy,
coupled to a small density of itinerant electrons. A component of the
structural transition is attributed to orbital, rather than magnetic ordering,
introducing a strongly anisotropic character to the system along the diagonal
directions of the iron lattice. Double exchange interactions couple the
diagonal chains leading to the observed ordering wavevector. The incommensurate
order in samples with excess iron arises from electron doping in this scenario.
The strong anisotropy of physical properties in the ordered phase should be
detectable by transport in single domains. Predictions for ARPES, inelastic
neutron scattering and hole/electron doping studies are also made.

Magnetic knots are defined as tubular embeddings of the magnetic field in an
ideal, perfectly conducting, incompressible fluid. An orthogonal, curvilinear
coordinate system is introduced and the magnetic energy is determined by the
poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field. Standard minimization
of the magnetic energy is carried out under the usual assumptions of volume-
and flux-preserving flow, with the additional constraints that the tube
cross-section remains circular and that the knot length (ropelength) is
independent from internal field twist (framing). Under these constraints the
minimum energy is determined analytically by a new, exact expression, function
of ropelength and framing. Groundstate energy levels of tight knots are
determined from ropelength data obtained by the SONO tightening algorithm
developed by Pieranski (Pieranski, 1998) and collaborators. Results for torus
knots are compared with previous work done by Chui & Moffatt (1995), and the
groundstate energy spectrum of the first prime knots (up to 10 crossings) is
presented and analyzed in detail. These results demonstrate that ropelength and
framing determine the spectrum of magnetic knots in tight configuration.

However, their algorithm do not result in a drawing that is planar and convex

a planar convex greedy embedding if and only if, in the embedding $x$, weight

isolated pulsars, assuming that pulsars are solid quark stars. We calculate the
heat capacity for such a quark star, and the results show that the residual
thermal energy cannot sustain the observed thermal X-ray luminosities seen in
typical isolated X-ray pulsars. We conclude that other heating mechanisms must
be in operation if the pulsars are in fact solid quark stars. Two possible
heating mechanisms are explored. Firstly, for pulsars with little
magnetospheric activities, accretion from the interstellar medium or from the
material in the associated supernova remnants may power the observed thermal
emission. In the propeller regime, a disk-accretion rate ${\dot M}\sim$1% of
the Eddington rate with an accretion onto the stellar surface at a rate of
$\sim 0.1% {\dot M}$ could explain the observed emission luminosities of the
dim isolated neutron stars and the central compact objects. Secondly, for
pulsars with significant magnetospheric activities, the pulsar spindown
luminosities may have been as the sources of the thermal energy via reversing
plasma current flows. A phenomenological study between pulsar bolometric X-ray
luminosities and the spin energy loss rates presents the probable existence of
a 1/2-law or a linear law, i.e. $L_{\rm bol}^{\infty}\propto\dot{E}^{1/2}$ or
$L_{\rm bol}^{\infty}\propto\dot{E}$. This result together with the thermal
properties of solid quark stars allow us to calculate the thermal evolution of
such stars. Thermal evolution curves, or cooling curves, are calculated and
compared with the `temperature-age' data obtained from 17 active X-ray pulsars.
It is shown that the bolometric X-ray observations of these sources are
consistent with the solid quark star pulsar model.

present analysis of two long XMM-Newton observations of the Ultra-Luminous
X-ray source (ULX) NGC 1313 X-1, which reveal that the system was in two
different spectral/temporal states. With a count rate of 1.5 counts/s and a
fractional variability amplitude of ~15%, the ULX was in a high flux and
strongly variable state in March 2006. In October 2006, the count rate of the
ULX had reduced by a factor of ~2 and the spectral shape was distinctly
different with the presence of a soft component. No strong variability was
detected during this low flux state with an upper limit on the amplitude < 3%.
Moreover, the spectral properties of the two states implies that the accretion
disk geometry was different for them. The low flux state is consistent with a
model where a standard accretion disk is truncated at a radius of ~17
Schwarzschild radius around a ~200 Msun black hole. The inner hot region
Comptonizes photons from the outer disk to give the primary spectral component.
The spectrum of the high flux state is not compatible with such a geometry.
Instead, it is consistent with a model where a hot corona covers a cold
accretion disk and Comptonizes the disk photons. The variability as a function
of energy is also shown to be consistent with the corona model. Despite these
broad analogies with Galactic black hole systems, the spectral nature of the
ULX is distinct in having a colder Comptonizing temperature (~2 keV) and higher
optical depth (~15) than what is observed for the Galactic ones.

the combination of spatial metric fluctuation and matter inhomogeneity for
which the action in General Relativity has canonical form, we find that this

that the extra degree of freedom is non-dynamical. The limit $\lambda \to 1$ is
well-behaved, unlike what is obtained when performing incomplete analyses of
cosmological fluctuations. Thus, there is no strong coupling problem for

compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. If the potential in the
action is taken to be of ""detailed balance"" form, we find a cancelation of the
highest derivative terms in the action for the curvature fluctuations. As a
consequence, the initial spectrum of perturbations will not be scale-invariant
in a general spacetime background. As an application, we consider fluctuations
in an inflationary background and draw connections with the ""trans-Planckian
problem"" for cosmological perturbations. In the special case in which the
potential term in the action is of detailed balance form and in which $\lambda

this cluster at more than 10 kpc from the Galactic centre. From the Brg, H2,

sources presenting excess emission at 2micron suggests that the stellar
population is very young, with many sources still in the pre-main sequence
accreting phase. By the use of theoretical pre-main sequence tracks we derived
a cluster mean age of about 2.5 Myears, and from the analyses of the fraction
of excess emission sources as a function of their spatial distribution we found
evidence for an age spread for the embedded pre-main sequence stellar
population. Finally, from the study of the spatial distribution of the low-mass
sources relative to the main-cluster source and associated photo-dissociation
zones, we conclude that the O-type star probably has been triggering the star

sample of 1613 nearby bright galaxies segregated by visible morphology. The LF
for late-type spirals follows a power law that rises towards low luminosities
whereas the LFs for ellipticals, lenticulars and bulge-dominated spirals are
peaked and decline toward both higher and lower luminosities. Each
morphological type (E, S0, S0/a-Sab, Sb-Sbc, Sc-Scd) contributes approximately
equally to the overall K-band luminosity density of galaxies in the local
universe. Type averaged bulge/disk ratios are used to subtract the disk
component leading to the prediction that the K-band LF for bulges is bimodal
with ellipticals dominating the high luminosity peak, comprising 60% of the
bulge luminosity density in the local universe with the remaining 40%
contributed by lenticulars and the bulges of spirals. Overall, bulges
contribute 30% of the galaxy luminosity density at K in the local universe with
spiral disks making up the remainder. If bulge luminosities indicate central
black hole masses, then our results predict that the black hole mass function
is also bimodal.

coherences and entanglement, we investigate numerically the dynamics of these
phenomena in one-dimensional linear chains and ring of nuclear spins 1/2
coupled by dipole dipole interactions. As opposed to the calculation of the MQ
coherence intensity based on the density matrix describing the spin system as a
whole, we consider the ""differentiated"" intensity related only to the chosen
spin pair based on the reduced density matrix. It is shown that the
entanglement and the MQ coherence have similar dynamics only for nearest
neighbors while we did not obtained any consistency for remote spins.

the finitely presented modules of finite length over the Leavitt path algebra
$L_k (E)$ and show its close relationship with the finite-dimensional
representations of the inverse quiver $\overline{E}$ of $E$, as well as with
the class of finitely generated $P_k(E)$-modules $M$ such that ${\rm
Tor}_q^{P_k (E)}(k^{|E^0|},M)=0$ for all $q$, where $P_k(E)$ is the usual path
algebra of $E$. By using these results we compute the higher $K$-theory of the
von Neumann regular algebra $Q_k (E)=L_k (E)\Sigma^{-1}$, where $\Sigma $ is
the set of all square matrices over $P_k (E)$ which are sent to invertible
matrices by the augmentation map $\epsilon \colon P_k (E)\to k^{|E^0|}$.

associated with a symmetric decomposition g_0=h+m and let S(M_0) be the spin
bundle defined by the spin representation r:H->GL_R(S) of the stabilizer H.
This article studies the superizations of M_0, i.e. its extensions to a
homogeneous supermanifold M=G/H whose sheaf of superfunctions is isomorphic to
Lambda(S^*(M_0)). Here G is a Lie supergroup which is the superization of the
Lie group G_0 associated with a certain extension of the Lie algebra g_0 to a
Lie superalgebra g=g_0+g_1=g_0+S, via the Kostant construction. The
construction of the superization g consists of two steps: extending the spin
representation r:h->gl_R(S) to a representation r:g_0->gl_R(S) and constructing
appropriate r(g_0)-equivariant bilinear maps on S. Since the Heisenberg algebra
heis is a codimension one ideal of the Cahen-Wallach Lie algebra g_0, first we
describe spin representations of gheis and then determine their extensions to
g_0. There are two large classes of spin representations of gheis and g_0: the
zero charge and the non-zero charge ones. The description strongly depends on
the dimension n+1 (mod 8). Some general results about superizations g=g_0+g_1
are stated and examples are constructed.
