dual description of the instanton dynamics of topological U(N) gauge theory on
D6 branes. The model is a higher dimensional analogue of the ADHM matrix model
that leads to Nekrasov's partition function. The fixed points of the toric
action on the moduli space are labeled by colored plane partitions. Assuming
the localization theorem, we compute the partition function as an equivariant
index. It turns out that the partition function does not depend on the vacuum
expectation values of Higgs fields that break U(N) symmetry to U(1)^N at low
energy. We conjecture a general formula of the partition function, which
reduces to a power of the MacMahon function, if we impose the Calabi-Yau
condition. For non Calabi-Yau case we prove the conjecture up to the third
order in the instanton expansion.

dangerous, given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the ""good

their magnetic field, spin, and orbital evolution. The core of a neutron star
is considered to be a superfluid, superconductor type II. Flux expulsion of the
magnetic field out of the core of a single neutron star has been discussed by
previous authors. However, the evolution of the core magnetic field is
substantially different for a binary neutron star. While for a single neutron
star the fluxoids of the proton superconductor always move outward through the
core, in a binary neutron star in the accretion phase fluxoids move back into
the core. The subsequent increase of the core magnetic field results in the
increase of the surface magnetic field. We ask weather within the framework of
this model the formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is possible. We show
that despite the increase of the core magnetic field, MSPs are formed in this
model. The evolution of the neutron star with various orbital periods, magnetic
fields, spin periods, and other parameters are numerically investigated. The
equation of state of the neutron star, initial orbital period of the binary,
and other parameters of the binary have substantial effects on the evolution of
period vs. magnetic field.

an investigation of self-gravitating effects. In the context of accretion discs
around stellar mass and intermediate mass black holes, we conclude that
convection alone cannot account for the total viscosity in the disc, but
significantly adds to it. For accretion rates up to 10% of the Eddington rate,
we find that differential rotation provides a sufficiently large underlying
viscosity. For higher accretion rates, further support is needed in the inner
disc region, which can be provided by an MRI-induced viscosity. We briefly
discuss the interplay of MRI, convection and differential rotation. We conduct
a detailed parameter study of the effects of central masses and accretion rates
on the disc models and find that the threshold value of the supporting
viscosity is determined mostly by the Eddington ratio with only little
influence from the central black hole mass.

points to a spectral gap remaining in the large-size limit, implying

discussed along with their physical implications on current models of AGN. Two
main correlations are discussed in this paper: a) a very strong
anti-correlation between the FWHM of the H$\beta$ optical line and the ratio
between the soft and the hard X-ray luminosity. Although similar
anti-correlations between optical line width and X-ray spectral steepness have
already been discussed in the literature (see e.g., Laor et al. 1994, Boller et
al. 1996, Brandt et al. 1997), we consider the formulation we present in this
paper is more fundamental, as it links model-independent quantities. Coupled
with a strong anti-correlation between the V to hard X-ray flux ratio and the
H$\beta$ FHWM, it supports scenarios for the origin of the soft excess in AGN,
which require strong suppression of the hard X-ray emission; b) a strong (and
expected) correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the black hole mass. Its
slope, flatter than 1, is consistent with Eddington ratio-dependent bolometric
corrections, such as that recently proposed by Vasudevan & Fabian (2009).
Moreover, we critically review through various statistical tests the role that
distance biases play in the strong radio to X-ray luminosity correlation found
in CAIXA and elsewhere; we conclude that only complete, unbiased samples (such
as that recently published by Behar & Laor, 2008) should be used to draw
observational constraints on the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet AGN.

In oxidized wires, we measure large exchange bias fields of the order of 0.1 T
below T ~ 100 K. The onset of the exchange bias, between the ferromagnetic core
and the anti-ferromagnetic CoO shell, is accompanied by a coercivity drop of
0.2 T which leads to a minimum in coercivity at $\sim100$ K. Magnetization
relaxation measurements show a temperature dependence of the magnetic viscosity
S which is consistent with a volume distribution of the CoO grains at the
surface. We propose that the superparamagnetic fluctuations of the
anti-ferromagnetic CoO shell play a key role in the flipping of the nanowire
magnetization and explain the coercivity drop. This is supported by
micromagnetic simulations. This behavior is specific to the geometry of a 1D
system which possesses a large shape anisotropy and was not previously observed
in 0D (spheres) or 2D (thin films) systems which have a high degree of symmetry
and low coercivities. This study underlines the importance of the AFM
super-paramagnetic fluctuations in the exchange bias mechanism.
