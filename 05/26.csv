incomes in a developing economy. We start with the assumption that incomes are
determined both by individual labour and by stochastic effects of trading and
investment. The income from personal effort alone is distributed about a mean,
while the income from trade, which may be positive or negative, is proportional
to the trader's income. These assumptions lead to a Langevin model with
multiplicative noise, from which we derive a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for
the income probability density function (IPDF) and its variation in time. We
find that high earners have a power-law income distribution while the low
income groups have a Levy IPDF. Comparing our analysis with the Indian survey
data (obtained from the world bank website) taken over many years we obtain a
near-perfect data collapse onto our model's equilibrium IPDF. The theory
quantifies the economic notion of ""given other things"". Using survey data to
relate the IPDF to actual food consumption we define a poverty index, which is
consistent with traditional indices, but independent of an arbitrarily chosen
""poverty line"" and therefore less susceptible to manipulation.

focusing on the transition between the two distinct local regimes
characteristic respectively of large and small potentials. From the dynamical
point of view, the transition signals the emergence of nonuniform
hyperbolicity, so the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent with respect to
parameters plays a central role in the analysis. Though often ill-behaved by
conventional measures, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is in fact remarkably
regular in a ``stratified sense'' which we define: the irregularity comes from
the matching of nice (analytic or smooth) functions along sets with complicated
geometry. This result allows us to stablish that the ``critical set'' for the
transition has at most codimension one, so for a typical potential the set of
critical energies is at most countable, hence typically not seen by spectral
measures. Key to our approach are two results about the dependence of the
Lyapunov exponent of one-frequency $\SL(2,\C)$ cocycles with respect to
perturbations in the imaginary direction: on one hand there is a severe
``quantization'' restriction, and on the other hand ``regularity'' of the
dependence characterizes uniform hyperbolicity when the Lyapunov exponent is
positive. Our method is independent of arithmetic conditions on the frequency.

instead they obtain system related information only via visual sensors. We draw
a connection between the convergence problem in robot networks, and the

processes to decide, for some constant $\epsilon$, values distance $\epsilon$
apart and within the range of initial proposed values). Surprisingly, even
though specifications are similar, the convergence implementation in robot
networks requires specific assumptions about synchrony and Byzantine
resilience. In more details, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions for
the convergence of mobile robots despite a subset of them being Byzantine (i.e.
they can exhibit arbitrary behavior). Additionally, we propose a deterministic
convergence algorithm for robot networks and analyze its correctness and
complexity in various synchrony settings. The proposed algorithm tolerates f
Byzantine robots for (2f+1)-sized robot networks in fully synchronous networks,
(3f+1)-sized in semi-synchronous networks. These bounds are optimal for the

dominated by a turbulent flow nearby and accretion shocks onto the core, which
resulting in the variation between inward and outward motions during the

affected by the depletion of molecules in the central region with high density
and low temperature. During the evolution of the core, the asymmetry of line

single convergent Puiseux series containing only powers of z^{1/m}, and there
are explicit recursive formulas to compute all the Puiseux series coefficients
from just the derivatives of A(z) at the origin. Using these recursive formulas
we calculate the series coefficients up to the second order and list them for
quick reference. This paper gives, under a generic condition, explicit
recursive formulas to compute the perturbed eigenvalues and eigenvectors for
non-selfadjoint analytic perturbations of matrices with degenerate eigenvalues.

Furthermore, we show that the onset of this chameleon screening is unrelated to
strong gravity. At large central pressures $P>\rho/3$, $f(R)$ gravity, like
general relativity, does have a maximum gravitational potential, but at a
slightly smaller value: $GM_\star/r_\star = 0.345 < 4/9$ for constant density

categories: Canonical coalitional games, coalition formation games, and
coalitional graph games. This new classification represents an
application-oriented approach for understanding and analyzing coalitional

and simulations. This model is interesting in the following respect: while it
is obvious that the objects interpreting formulas are games and that everything
is developed with the intuition of interaction in mind, the notion of morphism
is very different from traditional morphisms in games semantics. In particular,
we make no use of the notion of strategy! The resulting structure is very
different from what is usually found in categories of games. We start by
defining several constructions on those games and show, using elementary
considerations, that they enjoy the appropriate algebraic properties making
this category a denotational model for intuitionistic linear logic. An
interesting point is that the tensor product corresponds to a strongly
synchronous operation on games. This category can also, using traditional
translations, serve as a model for the simply typed -calculus. We use some of
the additional structure of the category to extend this to a model of the
simply typed differential -calculus. Once this is done, we go a little further
by constructing a reflexive object in this category, thus getting a concrete
non-trivial model for the untyped differential -calculus. We then show, using a
highly non-constructive principle, that this category is in fact a model for
full classical linear logic ; and we finally have a brief look at the related
notions of predicate transformers and containers.

category in which the objects--called interaction structures in the
paper--serve as descriptions of services provided across such handshaken
interfaces. The morphisms--called (general) simulations--model components that
provide one such service, relying on another. The morphisms are relations
between the underlying sets of the interaction structures. The proof that a
relation is a simulation can serve (in principle) as an executable program,
whose specification is that it provides the service described by its domain,
given an implementation of the service described by its codomain. This category
is then shown to coincide with the subcategory of ""generated"" basic topologies
in Sambin's terminology, where a basic topology is given by a closure operator
whose induced sup-lattice structure need not be distributive; and moreover,
this operator is inductively generated from a basic cover relation. This
coincidence provides topologists with a natural source of examples for
non-distributive formal topology. It raises a number of questions of interest
both for formal topology and programming. The extra structure needed to make
such a basic topology into a real formal topology is then interpreted in the

during the merging process, whereas others survive temporarily in the form of
subhalos. A long-standing problem with this picture is that the number of
subhalos predicted by simulations exceeds the number of luminous dwarf galaxies
seen in the the vicinity of large galaxies like the Milky Way. Many of the
subhalos must therefore have remained dark or very faint. If cold dark matter
subhalos are as common as predicted, gravitational lensing may in principle
offer a promising route to detection. In this review, we describe the many ways
through which lensing by subhalos can manifest itself, and summarize the
results from current efforts to constrain the properties of cold dark matter
subhalos using such effects.

investigation of their spectral shape, using the highest quality X-ray data
available in the XMM-Newton public archives. We confirm that simple spectral
models commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of ULXs (power-law
continuum and multi-colour disc blackbody models) are inadequate in the face of
such high quality data. Instead we find two near ubiquitous features in the
spectrum: a soft excess and a roll-over in the spectrum at energies above 3keV.
We investigate a range of more physical models to describe these data. We find
that disc plus Comptonised corona models fit the data well, but the derived
corona is cool, and optically thick (tau ~ 5-30). We argue that these observed
disc temperatures are not a good indicator of the black hole mass as the
powerful, optically thick corona drains energy from the inner disc, and
obscures it. We estimate the intrinsic (corona-less) disc temperature, and
demonstrate that in most cases it lies in the regime of stellar mass black
holes. These objects have spectra which range from those similar to the highest
mass accretion rate states in Galactic binaries, to those which clearly have
two peaks, one at energies below 1 keV (from the outer, unComptonised disc) and
one above 3 keV (from the Comptonised, inner disc). However, a few ULXs have a
significantly cooler corrected disc temperature; we suggest that these are the
most extreme stellar mass black hole accretors, in which a massive wind
completely envelopes the inner disc regions, creating a cool photosphere. We
conclude that ULXs provide us with an observational template for the transition
between Eddington and super-Eddington accretion flows, with the latter
occupying a new ultraluminous accretion state.

inversion techniques developed for Gaussian processes (GPs) that do not require

slightly worse rather than better. This would indicate that most morphological

optimization for delay-sensitive media transmission over time-varying wireless
channels as well as investigate the structures and properties of this solution,
such that it can be easily implemented in various multimedia systems and
applications. Specifically, we formulate this problem as a finite-horizon
Markov decision process (MDP) by explicitly considering the users'
heterogeneous multimedia traffic characteristics (e.g. delay deadlines,
distortion impacts and dependencies etc.), time-varying network conditions as
well as, importantly, their ability to adapt their cross-layer transmission
strategies in response to these dynamics. Based on the heterogeneous
characteristics of the media packets, we are able to express the transmission
priorities between packets as a new type of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This
DAG provides the necessary structure for determining the optimal cross-layer
actions in each time slot: the root packet in the DAG will always be selected
for transmission since it has the highest positive marginal utility; and the
complexity of the proposed cross-layer solution is demonstrated to linearly
increase w.r.t. the number of disconnected packet pairs in the DAG and
exponentially increase w.r.t. the number of packets on which the current
packets depend on. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
solution significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-layer
solutions. Moreover, we show that our solution provides the upper bound
performance for the cross-layer optimization solutions with delayed feedback
such as the well-known RaDiO framework.

SUSY-breaking sectors can play a significant role in determining the low-energy

solution to both the SUSY flavor problem and the mu / B mu problem. Recently,
it has been suggested that a large class of these models lead to identical
boundary conditions at the SUSY breaking scale. These boundary conditions would
severely constrain the models' viability. We demonstrate that the boundary
conditions are instead sensitive to the details of the hidden sector, so that
only specific hidden sectors may be ruled out by phenomenological
considerations. We determine the high scale boundary conditions using the
operator product expansion of the hidden sector. The techniques used to
determine the beta functions are generally applicable to the RG flow of any
approximately conformal hidden sector. The discrepancy with previously proposed
boundary conditions can be traced to the fact that the renormalization group
(RG) flow involves multiple fixed points.

from detailed studies of the period variability and of all available light
curves. We find that over about 56 years the orbital period of the system has
varied due to a combination of an upward parabola and a sinusoid rather than in
a monotonic fashion. Mass transfer from the less massive primary to the more
massive secondary component is likely responsible for at least a significant
part of the secular period change. The cyclical variation with a period of 7.57
yrs and a semi-amplitude of 0.0015 d can be produced either by a
light-travel-time effect due to an unseen companion with a scaled mass of $M_3
\sin i_3$=0.081 $M_\odot$ or by a magnetic period modulation in the secondary
star. Historical light curves of AR Boo, as well as our own, display
season-to-season light variability, which are best modeled by including both a
cool spot and a hot one on the secondary star. We think that the spots express
magnetic dynamo-related activity and offer limited support for preferring the
magnetic interpretation of the 7.57-year cycle over the third-body
understanding. Our solutions confirm that AR Boo belongs to the W-subtype
contact binary class, consisting of a hotter, less massive primary star with a

multiplier terms is shown to be locally minimized by a product of neutron and
proton Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer states. Nambu-Goldstone RPA solutions appear
due to global gauge invariance and isobaric invariance. In an idealized case of
infinitely many equidistant single-nucleon levels, the symmetry energy is
composed of contributions from the single-nucleon and isospin interaction
energies and the RPA correlation energy. The contribution of the latter is
dominated by a neutron-proton Nambu-Goldstone solution, which makes the total
symmetry energy nearly proportional to T(T+1). Observations reported from
Skyrme force calculations are discussed in the light of these results.
Calculations with deformed Woods-Saxon single-nucleon levels give results
similar to those of the idealized case, whereas a somewhat different behavior
is found with spherical Woods-Saxon levels. The calculations with Woods-Saxon
single-nucleon levels reproduce surprisingly well the empirical symmetry

The measures
quantify how most central nodes of a network are clumped together. The
assortativity coefficient defined in a previous study measures a similar
characteristic, but accounts only for the clumpiness of the central nodes that
are directly connected to each other. The clumpiness coefficient defined in the
present paper also takes into account the cases where central nodes are
separated by a few links. The definition is based on the node degrees and the
distances between pairs of nodes. The clumpiness coefficient together with the
assortativity coefficient can define four classes of network. Numerical
calculations demonstrate that the classification scheme successfully
categorizes 30 real-world networks into the four classes: clumped assortative,
clumped disassortative, loose assortative and loose disassortative networks.
The clumpiness coefficient also differentiates the Erdos-Renyi model from the
Barabasi-Albert model, which the assortativity coefficient could not
differentiate. In addition, the bounds of the clumpiness coefficient as well as
the relationships between the three measures of clumpiness are discussed.

motivated by display ad allocation on the Internet. In the online, but
adversarial case, the celebrated result of Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani gives an
approximation ratio of $1-1/e$. In the online, stochastic case when nodes are
drawn repeatedly from a known distribution, the greedy algorithm matches this
approximation ratio, but still, no algorithm is known that beats the $1 - 1/e$
bound.
  Our main result is a 0.67-approximation online algorithm for stochastic
bipartite matching, breaking this $1 - {1/e}$ barrier. Furthermore, we show
that no online algorithm can produce a $1-\epsilon$ approximation for an
arbitrarily small $\epsilon$ for this problem.
  We employ a novel application of the idea of the power of two choices from
load balancing: we compute two disjoint solutions to the expected instance, and
use both of them in the online algorithm in a prescribed preference order.
  To identify these two disjoint solutions, we solve a max flow problem in a
boosted flow graph, and then carefully decompose this maximum flow to two
edge-disjoint (near-)matchings. These two offline solutions are used to
characterize an upper bound for the optimum in any scenario. This is done by
identifying a cut whose value we can bound under the arrival distribution.

the massive amount of interaction data that is available from large complex
networks. They allow us to study the extent to which a node takes part when
information is passed around the network. Nodes with high betweenness may be
regarded as key players that have a highly active role. At one extreme,
betweenness has been defined by considering information passing only through
the shortest paths between pairs of nodes. At the other extreme, an alternative
type of betweenness has been defined by considering all possible walks of any
length. In this work, we propose a betweenness measure that lies between these
two opposing viewpoints. We allow information to pass through all possible
routes, but introduce a scaling so that longer walks carry less importance.
This new definition shares a similar philosophy to that of communicability for
pairs of nodes in a network, which was introduced by Estrada and Hatano (Phys.
Rev. E 77 (2008) 036111). Having defined this new communicability betweenness
measure, we show that it can be characterized neatly in terms of the
exponential of the adjacency matrix. We also show that this measure is closely
related to a Frechet derivative of the matrix exponential. This allows us to
conclude that it also describes network sensitivity when the edges of a given
node are subject to infinitesimally small perturbations. Using illustrative
synthetic and real life networks, we show that the new betweenness measure
behaves differently to existing versions, and in particular we show that it
recovers meaningful biological information from a protein-protein interaction

the complex network and links determined by the communicability function. Then,
the problem of finding the network communities is transformed to an all-clique
problem of the communicability graph. We discuss the efficiency of this
algorithm of community detection. In addition, we extend here the concept of
the communicability to account for the strength of the interactions between the
nodes by using the concept of inverse temperature of the network. Finally, we
develop an algorithm to manage the different degrees of overlapping between the
communities in a complex network. We then analyze the USA airport network, for

the western/central airports as well as two bridging central communities. In
striking contrast, a well-known algorithm groups all but two of the continental

walls formed by decays to small black holes. This enables us to isolate a
region in moduli space for which no decays occur within this class. We then
study entropy enigma decays for such models and show that for generic values of

supernovae and of their host galaxies in the gri passbands. We show that the
luminosity function of type Ia supernova host galaxies matches well with that
of galaxies in the general field, suggesting that the occurrence of type Ia
supernovae does not favour a particular type of galaxies but is predominantly
proportional to the luminosity of galaxies. The only evidence that points to
possible correlation between the supernova rate and star formation activity is
that the supernova rate in late-type galaxies is higher than that in early-type
galaxies by 31+/-35%. The sample contains 8 type Ia supernovae whose host
galaxies were not identified, but it is shown that their occurrence is
consistent with them occurred in low luminous galaxies beyond the survey. The
luminosity function of type Ia supernovae is approximately Gaussian with the
full-width half maximum being a factor of 1.4 in luminosity. The Gaussian
distribution becomes tighter if the ratio of extinction to reddening, R_V, is
lower than the characteristic value for the Milky Way and if luminosity is
corrected for the light curve shape. The colour excess is ~0.07 mag which is
significantly smaller than reddening expected for field galaxies. This colour
excess does not vary with the distance of the supernovae from the centre of the
host galaxy to 15 kpc. This suggests that the major part of the colour excess
appears to be either intrinsic or reddening that arises in the immediate
environment of supernova, rather than interstellar reddening in host galaxies.

renormalization procedure at fixed energy which preserves the Green functions
of the remaining sites [H. Aoki, J. Phys. C13, 3369 (1980)]. Using this
procedure for the Anderson tight-binding model in dimensions $d=2,3$, we study
numerically the statistical properties of the renormalized on-site energies
$\epsilon$ and of the renormalized hoppings $V$ as a function of the linear
size $L$. We find that the renormalized on-site energies $\epsilon$ remain
finite in the localized phase in $d=2,3$ and at criticality ($d=3$), with a
finite density at $\epsilon=0$ and a power-law decay $1/\epsilon^2$ at large $|
\epsilon |$. For the renormalized hoppings in the localized phase, we find:
${\rm ln} V_L \simeq -\frac{L}{\xi_{loc}}+L^{\omega}u$, where $\xi_{loc}$ is
the localization length and $u$ a random variable of order one. The exponent
$\omega$ is the droplet exponent characterizing the strong disorder phase of
the directed polymer in a random medium of dimension $1+(d-1)$, with
$\omega(d=2)=1/3$ and $\omega(d=3) \simeq 0.24$. At criticality $(d=3)$, the
statistics of renormalized hoppings $V$ is multifractal, in direct
correspondence with the multifractality of individual eigenstates and of
two-point transmissions. In particular, we measure $\rho_{typ}\simeq 1$ for the
exponent governing the typical decay $\overline{{\rm ln} V_L} \simeq
-\rho_{typ} {\rm ln}L$, in agreement with previous numerical measures of
$\alpha_{typ} =d+\rho_{typ} \simeq 4$ for the singularity spectrum $f(\alpha)$

are studied in the semi-classical approach to the well-defined quantum model.
It is shown that near the initial cosmological singularity point quantum
gravity effects ~ h exhibit themselves in the form of additional matter source
with the negative pressure and the equation of state as for ultrastiff matter.
The analytical solution of the equations of theory of gravity, in which matter
is represented by the radiation and additional matter source of quantum nature,
is found. It is shown that in the stage of the evolution of the universe, when
quantum corrections ~ h dominate over the radiation, the geometry of the
universe is described by the metric which is conformal to a metric of a unit
four-sphere in a five-dimensional Euclidean flat space. In the radiation
dominated era the metric is found to be conformal to a unit hyperboloid
embedded in a five-dimensional Lorentz-signatured flat space. The origin of the
universe can be interpreted as a quantum transition of the system from the
region in a phase space with a trajectory in imaginary time into the region,
where the equations of motion have the solution in real time. Near the boundary
between two regions the universe undergoes almost an exponential expansion
which passes smoothly into the expansion under the action of radiation
dominating over matter. As a result of such a quantum transition the geometry
of the universe changes. This agrees with the hypothesis about the possible
change of geometry after the nucleation of expanding universe from `nothing'.

matrix and its spectrum. This formula allows us to define acceptance
probabilities for edge switchings, such that the Markov chains become
controlled Glauber-type detailed balance processes, designed to evolve to any
required invariant measure (representing the asymptotic frequencies with which
the allowed graphs are visited during the process). As a corollary we also
derive a condition in terms of simple degree statistics, sufficient to
guarantee that, in the limit where the number of nodes diverges, even for
state-independent acceptance probabilities of proposed moves the invariant
measure of the process will be uniform. We test our theory on synthetic graphs

algorithm (SPA) by interleaving SPA iterations with a random local graph update
rule. This rule is known as edge local complementation (ELC), and has the
effect of modifying the Tanner graph while preserving the code. We have
previously shown how the ELC operation can be used to implement an iterative
permutation group decoder (SPA-PD)--one of the most successful iterative
soft-decision decoding strategies at small blocklengths. In this work, we
exploit the fact that ELC can also give structurally distinct parity-check
matrices for the same code. Our aim is to describe a simple iterative decoder,
running SPA-PD on distinct structures, based entirely on random usage of the
ELC operation. This is called SPA-ELC, and we focus on small blocklength codes
with strong algebraic structure. In particular, we look at the extended Golay
code and two extended quadratic residue codes. Both error rate performance and
average decoding complexity, measured by the average total number of messages
required in the decoding, significantly outperform those of the standard SPA,
and compares well with SPA-PD. However, in contrast to SPA-PD, which requires a
global action on the Tanner graph, we obtain a performance improvement via
local action alone. Such localized algorithms are of mathematical interest in
their own right, but are also suited to parallel/distributed realizations.

patterns across real-world networks ignore edge weights, an important
information in real-world networks. We propose a new methodology for
generalizing measures of unweighted networks through a generalization of the
cardinality concept of a set of weights. The key observation here is that many
measures of unweighted networks use the cardinality (the size) of some subset
of edges in their computation. For example, the node degree is the number of
edges incident to a node. We define the effective cardinality, a new metric
that quantifies how many edges are effectively being used, assuming that an
edge's weight reflects the amount of interaction across that edge. We prove
that a generalized measure, using our method, reduces to the original
unweighted measure if there is no disparity between weights, which ensures that
the laws that govern the original unweighted measure will also govern the
generalized measure when the weights are equal. We also prove that our
generalization ensures a partial ordering (among sets of weighted edges) that
is consistent with the original unweighted measure, unlike previously developed
generalizations. We illustrate the applicability of our method by generalizing
four unweighted network measures. As a case study, we analyze four real-world
weighted networks using our generalized degree and clustering coefficient. The
analysis shows that the generalized degree distribution is consistent with the
power-law hypothesis but with steeper decline and that there is a common
pattern governing the ratio between the generalized degree and the traditional
degree. The analysis also shows that nodes with more uniform weights tend to

system of chiral spherocylinders based on the classical Onsager theory for hard
anisometric bodies. The rods consist of a hard spherocylindrical backbone
surrounded with a square-well potential to account for attractive (or soft
repulsive) interactions. Long-ranged chiral interactions are described by means
of a simple pseudo-scalar potential which is appropriate for weak chiral forces
of a predominant electrostatic origin. Based on the formalism proposed by
Straley [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 14}, 1835 (1976)] we derive explicit algebraic
expressions for the twist elastic modulus and the cholesteric pitch for rods as
a function of density and temperature. The pitch varies non-monotonically with
density, with a sharp decrease at low packing fractions and a marked increase
at higher packing fractions. A similar trend is found for the temperature
dependence. The unwinding of the helical pitch at high densities (or low
temperatures) originates from a marked increase in the local nematic order and
a steep increase of the twist elastic resistance associated with near-parallel
local rod configurations. This contrasts with the commonly held view that the
increase in pitch with decreasing temperature as often observed in cholesterics
is due to layer formation resulting from pre-smectic fluctuations. The increase
in pitch with increasing temperature is consistent with an entropic unwinding
as the chiral interaction becomes less and less significant than the thermal
energy. The variation of the pitch with density, temperature and contour length
is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental results on colloidal {\em
fd} rods.

equations on the wall. In contrast to the previous works, we take the
contribution of the electrostatic energy on the wall into account. By examining
the properties of the effective potential, we find that a bounce can always
happen outside the (outer) horizon. For larger masses of the black hole, the
height of the barrier between the horizon and bouncing point in the effective
potential becomes smaller, leading to longer time scales of bouncing process.

data and steady-state calcium-dependent tension data and simulate
non-cooperative calcium binding both in the presence and absence of myosin. All

slope of x=1.15 as opposed to a standard x=1.3), and a lower fraction of

examine the rate of supernova explosions in the simulated galaxies. In

binary LP 349- 25, finding that the observed emission is broadband and steady
on timescales between 10s and 10.7 hours, as well as on timescales of 0.6 and
1.6 years. This system is unusual for ultracool dwarfs with detectable radio
emission, in exhibiting a lack of any large scale variability, particularly the
bursting (periodic or aperiodic) behavior exhibited by the other objects with
detectable levels of radio emission. We explore the constraints that the lack
of variability on long and short timescales, and flat spectral index, imply
about the radio-emitting structures and mechanism. The temporal constraints
argue for a high latitude emitting region with a large inclination so that it
is always in view, and survives for at least 0.6 year. Temporal constraints
also limit the plasma conditions, implying that the electron density be n_e
<4x10^5 cm-3 and B < 130 G in order not to see time variations due to
collisional or radiative losses from high energy particles. The observations
and constraints provided by them are most compatible with a nonthermal radio
emission mechanism, likely gyrosynchrotron emission from a spatially
homogeneous or inhomogeneous source. This indicates that, similar to behaviors
noted for chromospheric, transition region, and coronal plasmas in ultracool
dwarfs, the magnetic activity patterns observed in active higher mass stars can
survive to the substellar boundary. We also present new epochs of

from odd-$Z$ elements between Na and Co (and Ti and Cr) not previously observed
in X-rays. We present synthetic spectral models which can be used to constrain
these element abundances and other parameters describing the outflow from the
warm absorber in this object. We present results of fitting to the spectrum
using various tools and techniques, including automated line fitting,
phenomenological models, and photoionization modeling. We show that the
behavior of the curves of growth of lines from H-like and Li-like ions indicate
that the lines are either saturated or affected by filling-in from scattered or
a partially covered continuum source. We confirm the conclusion of previous
work by \cite{Mill06} and \cite{Mill08} which shows that the ionization
conditions are not consistent with wind driving due to thermal expansion. The
spectrum provides the opportunity to measure abundances for several elements
not typically observable in the X-ray band. These show a pattern of enhancement
for iron peak elements, and solar or sub-solar values for elements lighter than
calcium. Models show that this is consistent with enrichment by a core-collapse
supernova. We discuss the implications these values for the evolutionary
history of this system.

perturbative fashion. The original idea was put forward in the Coulomb gauge at
tree level. In recent years, the concept of a nonperturbative short distance
linear potential also attracted phenomenological attention. Motivated by these
observations, we discuss how a perturbative framework, leading to a linear
piece in the potential, can be developed in a manifestly gauge and Lorentz
invariant manner, which moreover enjoys the property of being renormalizable to
all orders. We provide an effective action framework to discuss the dynamical
realization of the proposed scenario in Yang-Mills gauge theory.

geometric non-stretching flows of curves in the quaternionic projective space
$HP^n$. The derivation adapts the method and results in recent work by one of
us on the Hamiltonian structure of non-stretching curve flows in Riemannian
symmetric spaces $M=G/H$ by viewing $HP^n \simeq {\rm U}(n+1,H)/{\rm U}(1,H)
\times {\rm U}(n,H)\simeq {\rm Sp}(n+1)/{\rm Sp}(1)\times {\rm Sp}(n)$ as a
symmetric space in terms of compact real symplectic groups and quaternion
unitary groups. As main results, scalar-vector (multi-component) versions of
the sine-Gordon (SG) equation and the modified Korteveg-de Vries (mKdV)
equation are obtained along with their bi-Hamiltonian integrability structure
consisting of a shared hierarchy of quaternionic symmetries and conservation
laws generated by a hereditary recursion operator. The corresponding geometric
curve flows in $HP^n$ are shown to be described by a non-stretching wave map
and a mKdV analog of a non-stretching Schrodinger map.

quantum superpositions when a system has interacted with a sufficiently large
number of degrees of freedom of the environment. This is due to the fact that
gravity imposes fundamental limitations on how accurate measurements can be.
This leads to the notion of undecidability: there is no way to tell, due to
fundamental limitations, if a quantum system evolved unitarily or suffered
wavefunction collapse. This in turn provides a solution to the problem of
outcomes in quantum measurement by providing a sharp criterion for defining
when an event has taken place. We analyze in detail in examples two situations
in which in principle one could recover information about quantum coherence: a)
""revivals"" of coherence in the interaction of a system with the environment and
b) the measurement of global observables of the system plus apparatus plus
environment. We show in the examples that the fundamental limitations due to
gravity and quantum mechanics in measurement prevent both revivals from
occurring and the measurement of global observables. It can therefore be argued
that the emerging picture provides a complete resolution to the measurement
problem in quantum mechanics.

is derived using an expansion in a parameter characterizing the ""distance"" to
the superconductor - normal phase transition line. The expansion allows a
systematic improvement of the solution. The phase diagram of the vortex matter
in magnetic field is determined in detail. In the presence of significant
thermal fluctuations on the mesoscopic scale (for example in high $T_{c}$
materials) the vortex crystal melts into a vortex liquid. A quantitative theory
of thermal fluctuations using the lowest Landau level approximation is given.
It allows to determine the melting line and discontinuities at melt, as well as
important characteristics of the vortex liquid state. In the presence of
quenched disorder (pinning) the vortex matter acquires certain ""glassy""
properties. The irreversibility line and static properties of the vortex glass
state are studied using the ""replica"" method. Most of the analytical methods
are introduced and presented in some detail. Various quantitative and
qualitative features are compared to experiments in type II superconductors,

restricted to superconductivity and can be applied with certain adjustments to
other physical systems, for example rotating Bose - Einstein condensate.

distribution (QKD) with an untrusted source. A complete proof of its
unconditional security is also presented. This scheme has significant
advantages in real-life implementations as it does not require fast optical
switching or a quantum random number generator. The essential idea is to use a
beam splitter to split each input pulse. We show that we can characterize the
source using a cross-estimate technique without active routing of each pulse.
We have derived analytical expressions for the passive estimation scheme.
Moreover, using simulations, we have considered four real-life imperfections:
Additional loss introduced by the ""plug & play"" structure, inefficiency of the
intensity monitor, noise of the intensity monitor, and statistical fluctuation
introduced by finite data size. Our simulation results show that the passive
estimate of an untrusted source remains useful in practice, despite these four
imperfections. Also, we have performed preliminary experiments, confirming the
utility of our proposal in real-life applications. Our proposal makes it
possible to implement the ""plug & play"" QKD with the security guaranteed, while
keeping the implementation practical.

explicit inter-component dependencies. Studying large instances of such
systems?such as free and open source software (FOSS) distributions?in terms of
declared dependencies between packages is appealing. It is however also
misleading when the language to express dependencies is as expressive as
boolean formulae, which is often the case. In such settings, a more appropriate
notion of component dependency exists: strong dependency. This paper introduces
such notion as a first step towards modeling semantic, rather then syntactic,
inter-component relationships. Furthermore, a notion of component sensitivity
is derived from strong dependencies, with ap- plications to quality assurance
and to the evaluation of upgrade risks. An empirical study of strong
dependencies and sensitivity is presented, in the context of one of the
