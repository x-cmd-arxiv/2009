Collider (LHC) but no signs of an associated fourth family of quarks. What
would that imply? An intriguing possibility is that the new fermions needed to
compensate for the new leptons gauge anomalies simultaneously address the big
hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. A natural way to accomplish such a
scenario is to have the Higgs itself be composite of these new fermions. This
is the setup we are going to investigate in this paper using as a template
Minimal Walking Technicolor. We analyze a general heavy neutrino mass structure
with and without mixing with the Standard Model families. We also analyze the
LHC potential to observe the fourth lepton family in tandem with the new
composite Higgs dynamics. We finally introduce a model uniting the fourth
lepton family and the technifermion sector at higher energies.

from about 5% to 80%. Blazar variability has some similarities to that of type
I quasars but includes larger amplitude fluctuations on all timescales. FSRQ
variability amplitudes are particularly similar to those of QSOs on timescales
of several months, suggesting significant contributions from the accretion disk

correlated with the maximum apparent velocities of the radio jet for the subset

a model for the atomic displacements associated with these phonon modes that is

This analysis suggests that the scattering is not from tilt modes (rotational
modes of oxygen octahedra), but from zone-boundary optic modes that are
associated with the displacement of Pb^{2+} and O^{2-} ions. Whereas similar
columns of scattering have been reported in metallic and (less commonly)

finitely many closed points on a k-smooth irreducible affine scheme, where k is
an infinite field. Given a smooth O-group scheme morphism mu G to C of
reductive O-group schemes, with a torus C one can form a functor from
O-algebras to abelian groups, which takes an O-algebra S to the quotient group
F(S)=C(S) modulo mu(G(S)). Assuming additionally that the kernel of mu is a
reductive O-group scheme, we prove that this functor satisfies a purity theorem
for the k-algebra O.

particle states. Assuming supersymmetry, we update the quark and lepton mass
matrices at the grand unification scale accounting for threshold corrections
enhanced by large tan beta. From the hypothesis that quark and lepton masses
satisfy a classic set of relationships suggested in some Grand Unified Theories
(GUTs), we predict tan beta needs to be large, and the gluino's soft mass needs
to have the opposite sign to the wino's soft mass. Existing tools to measure
the phase of the gluino's mass at upcoming hadron colliders require
model-independent, kinematic techniques to determine the masses of the new
supersymmetric particle states. We discuss the current techniques to determine
the mass of invisible particles. We review the transverse mass kinematic
variable M_{T2} and the use of invariant-mass edges to find relationships
between masses. Next, we introduce a new technique to add additional
constraints between the masses of new particle states using M_{T2} at different
stages in a symmetric decay chain. These new relationships further constrain
the mass differences between new particle states, but still leave the absolute
mass weakly determined. Next, we introduce the constrained mass variables
M_{2C,LB}, M_{2C,UB}, M_{3C,LB}, M_{3C,UB} to provide event-by-event
lower-bounds and upper-bounds to the mass scale given mass differences. We
demonstrate mass scale determination in realistic case studies of supersymmetry
models by fitting ideal distributions to simulated data. We conclude that the
techniques introduced in this thesis have precision and accuracy that rival or
exceed the best known techniques for invisible-particle mass-determination at

varying $h/d$, where $h$ is the thickness of the film and $d$ the diameter of
the particles. The hydrodynamics of these films are determined by looking at
the correlated motion of pairs of particles as a function of separation $R$.
The Trapeznikov approximation [A. A. Trapeznikov, \emph{PICSA} (1957)] is used
to model soap films as an effective interface in contact with bulk air phases,
that behaves as a 2D fluid. The flow fields determined from correlated particle
motions show excellent agreement with what is expected for the theory of 2D
fluids for all our films where $0.6 \leq h/d \leq 14.3$, with the surface
viscosity matching that predicted by Trapeznikov. However, for thicker films
with $h/d > 7 \pm 3$, single particle motion is faster than expected.
Additionally, while the flow fields still match those expected for 2D fluids,
the parameters of these flow fields change markedly for thick films. Our
results indicate a transition from 2D to 3D fluid-like behavior occurs at this
value of $h/d$.

unusual properties such as inequivalence of ensembles, negative specific heat,
slow decay of correlations and ergodicity breaking. And (b) systems with faster
decay of the interaction potential where the energy is additive, thus resulting
in less dramatic effects. These interaction affect the thermodynamic behavior

describing encoding (stimulus-response) transformations by single sensory as
well as motor neurons. Recently, there has been rising interest in the second-
and higher-order correlation structure of neural spike trains, and how it may
be related to specific encoding relationships. The distortion of signal
correlations as they are transformed through particular LNP models is
predictable and in some cases analytically tractable and invertible. Here, we
propose that LNP encoding models can potentially be identified strictly from
the correlation transformations they induce, and develop a computational method
for identifying minimum-phase single-neuron temporal kernels under white and
colored- random Gaussian excitation. Unlike reverse-correlation or
maximum-likelihood, correlation-distortion based identification does not
require the simultaneous observation of stimulus-response pairs - only their
respective second order statistics. Although in principle filter kernels are
not necessarily minimum-phase, and only their spectral amplitude can be
uniquely determined from output correlations, we show that in practice this
method provides excellent estimates of kernels from a range of parametric
models of neural systems. We conclude by discussing how this approach could
potentially enable neural models to be estimated from a much wider variety of

  Moore","15 pages",,,,"math.GR math.KT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A conjecture of Moore claims that if G is a group and H a finite index
subgroup of G such that G - H has no elements of prime order (e.g. G is torsion
free), then a G-module which is projective over H is projective over G. The
conjecture is known for finite groups. In that case, it is a direct consequence
of Chouinard's theorem which is based on a fundamental result of Serre on the
vanishing of products of Bockstein operators. It was observed by Benson, using
a construction of Baumslag, Dyer and Heller, that the analog of Serre's Theorem
for infinite groups is not true in general. We prove that the conjecture is
true for groups which satisfy the analog of Serre's theorem. Using a result of
Benson and Goodearl, we prove that the conjecture holds for all groups inside
Kropholler's hierarchy LHF, extending a result of Aljadeff, Cornick, Ginosar,
and Kropholler. We show two closure properties for the class of pairs of groups
(G,H) which satisfy the conjecture, the one is closure under morphisms, and the
other is a closure operation which comes from Kropholler's construction. We use
this in order to exhibit cases in which the analog of Serre's theorem does not
hold, and yet the conjecture is true. We will show that in fact there are pairs
of groups (G,H) in which H is a perfect normal subgroup of prime index in G,
and the conjecture is true for (G,H). Moreover, we will show that it is enough
to prove the conjecture for groups of this kind only.

radio (CR) system that is able to operate concurrently with the licensed
primary radio (PR) system. We propose a practical CR transmission strategy
consisting of three major stages: environment learning, channel training, and
data transmission. In the environment learning stage, the CR transceivers both
listen to the PR transmission and apply blind algorithms to estimate the spaces
that are orthogonal to the channels from the PR. Assuming time-division duplex
(TDD) based transmission for the PR, cognitive beamforming is then designed and
applied at CR transceivers to restrict the interference to/from the PR during
the subsequent channel training and data transmission stages. In the channel
training stage, the CR transmitter sends training signals to the CR receiver,
which applies the linear-minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) based estimator to
estimate the effective channel. Considering imperfect estimations in both
learning and training stages, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic capacity
achievable for the CR in the data transmission stage. From this capacity lower
bound, we observe a general learning/training/throughput tradeoff associated
with the proposed scheme, pertinent to transmit power allocation between
training and transmission stages, as well as time allocation among learning,
training, and transmission stages. We characterize the aforementioned tradeoff
by optimizing the associated power and time allocation to maximize the CR
ergodic capacity.

of the inconsistency between the Nernst theorem and the ""linearly decreasing

environment must be taken into account. In particular it is recalled the old
problem raised by Mott in 1929 (\cite{m}) concerning the straight tracks
observed in a cloud chamber, produced by an $\alpha$-particle emitted by a
source in the form of a spherical wave. The conceptual relevance of the problem
for a clearer understanding of the classical limit is discussed in a historical
perspective. Moreover a simple mathematical model is proposed, where the result
of Mott is obtained in a rigorous mathematical way.

ignition mass. When the ignition mass is larger than a critical value, winds
are suppressed by a density-inversion layer. Such a static solution can be
