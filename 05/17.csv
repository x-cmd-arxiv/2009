Part four: continuation past a caustic","48 pages, 15 figures",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Theories of monochromatic high-frequency electromagnetic fields have been
designed by Felsen, Kravtsov, Ludwig and others with a view to portraying
features that are ignored by geometrical optics. These theories have recourse
to eikonals that encode information on both phase and amplitude -- in other
words, are complex-valued. The following mathematical principle is ultimately
behind the scenes: any geometric optical eikonal, which conventional rays
engender in some light region, can be consistently continued in the shadow
region beyond the relevant caustic, provided an alternative eikonal, endowed
with a non-zero imaginary part, comes on stage. In the present paper we explore
such a principle in dimension $2.$ We investigate a partial differential system
that governs the real and the imaginary parts of complex-valued two-dimensional
eikonals, and an initial value problem germane to it. In physical terms, the
problem in hand amounts to detecting waves that rise beside, but on the dark
side of, a given caustic. In mathematical terms, such a problem shows two main
peculiarities: on the one hand, degeneracy near the initial curve; on the other
hand, ill-posedness in the sense of Hadamard. We benefit from using a number of
technical devices: hodograph transforms, artificial viscosity, and a suitable
discretization. Approximate differentiation and a parody of the
quasi-reversibility method are also involved. We offer an algorithm that
restrains instability and produces effective approximate solutions.

sufficiently accurate to test model predictions. We aim to model the
photometric granulation background of HD49933 as well as the Sun, and compare
the predictions to the measurements obtained by the COROT and SOHO satellite
missions. We construct hydrodynamical model atmospheres representing HD49933
and the Sun, and use a previously developed scaling technique to obtain the
observable disk-integrated brightness fluctuations. We further performed
exploratory magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of small
scale magnetic fields on the synthetic light-curves. We find that the
granulation-related brightness fluctuations depend on metallicity. We obtain a
satisfactory correspondence between prediction and observation for the Sun,
validating our approach. For HD49933, we arrive at a significant
over-estimation by a factor of two to three in total power. Locally generated
magnetic fields are unlikely to be responsible, otherwise existing fields would
need to be rather strong to sufficiently suppress the granulation signal.
Presently suggested updates on the fundamental stellar parameters do not
improve the correspondence; however, an ad-hoc increase of the HD49933 surface
gravity by about 0.2dex would eliminate most of the discrepancy. We diagnose a
puzzling discrepancy between the predicted and observed granulation background
in HD49933, with only rather ad-hoc ideas for remedies at hand.

mean J and K magnitudes and have constructed the period-luminosity (PL)
relations in these bands. Using the near-infrared PL relations together with
those in the optical V and I bands, we have determined a true distance modulus
for NGC 247 of 27.64 mag, with a random uncertainty of $\pm$2% and a systematic
uncertainty of $\sim$4% which is dominated by the effect of unresolved stars on
the Cepheid photometry. The mean reddening affecting the NGC 247 Cepheids of
E(B-V) = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.02 mag is mostly produced in the host galaxy itself and
is significantly higher than what was found in the previous optical Cepheid
studies in NGC 247 of our own group, and Madore et al., leading to a 7%
decrease in the previous optical Cepheid distance. As in other studies of our

SMBH must move relative to the inflowing gas, such that the jets continuously
encounter fresh gas. Taking into account the relative motion of the SMBH and
the inflowing gas I derive a relation between the mass accreted by the SMBH and
the mass that is not expelled, and is assumed to form the bulge. This relation

biomass production rate. Almaas et al have shown that the flux distribution
follows a power law, and it is possible to associate with most metabolites two
reactions which maximally produce and consume a give metabolite, respectively.
This observation led to the concept of high-flux backbone (HFB) in metabolic
networks. In previous work, the HFB has been computed using a particular optima
obtained using FBA. In this paper, we investigate the conservation of HFB of a
particular solution for a given medium across different alternate optima and
near-optima in metabolic networks of E. coli and S. cerevisiae. Using flux
variability analysis (FVA), we propose a method to determine reactions that are
guaranteed to be in HFB regardless of alternate solutions. We find that the HFB
of a particular optima is largely conserved across alternate optima in E. coli,
while it is only moderately conserved in S. cerevisiae. However, the HFB of a
particular near-optima shows a large variation across alternate near-optima in
both organisms. We show that the conserved set of reactions in HFB across
alternate near-optima has a large overlap with essential reactions and
reactions which are both uniquely consuming (UC) and uniquely producing (UP).
Our findings suggest that the structure of the metabolic network admits a high
degree of redundancy and plasticity in near-optimal flow patterns enhancing
system robustness for a given environmental condition.

predicts the relation m_\nu ~ v^4/M^3, where v is the electroweak scale, rather
than the conventional seesaw formula m_\nu ~ v^2/M. Such a mass relation is
obtained via effective dimension seven operators LLHH(H*H)/M^3, which arise
when an isospin 3/2 Higgs multiplet \Phi is introduced along with iso-triplet
leptons. The masses of these particles are naturally in the TeV scale. The
neutral member of \Phi acquires an induced vacuum expectation value and
generates neutrino masses, while its triply charged partner provides the
smoking gun signal of this scenario. These triply charged bosons can be pair
produced at the LHC and the Tevatron, with \Phi^{+++} decaying into W^+l^+l^+
or W^+W^+W^+, possibly with displaced vertices. The leptonic decays of
\Phi^{+++} will help discriminate between normal and inverted hierarchies of
neutrino masses. This scenario also allows for raising the standard Higgs boson
mass to values in excess of 500 GeV.

to the nodes of the given network via preferential attachment. In contrast to a
random attachment of newly incoming nodes that was used in previous work, this
preferential attachment mechanism accelerates the generation of a so-called
autocatalytic set after a start from a random geometry and the growth of this
structure until it saturates in a stationary phase in which the whole system is
an autocatalytic set. Moreover, the system in the stationary phase becomes much
more stable against crashes in the population size as compared to random

Essentially it is a very dense core with many loops and less nodes playing the

based on the t-J model with the el-ph interaction arising from the modulation
of the superexchange interaction by phonons. The self-energy of electrons is
decomposed into the single-site and multisite ones. It is proved by using the
mapping of the single-site one in the t-J model to its corresponding one in the
Anderson model that the single-site self-energy is that of a normal Fermi
liquid, even if a superconducting (SC) order parameter appears or the multisite
one is anomalous. The electron liquid characterized by the single-site
self-energy is a normal Fermi liquid. The Fermi liquid is further stabilized by
the RVB mechanism. The stabilized Fermi liquid is a relevant unperturbed state
that can be used to study superconductivity and anomalous Fermi-liquid
behaviors. The so-called spin-fluctuation-mediated exchange interaction, which
includes the superexchange interaction as a part, is the attractive interaction
that binds d-wave Cooper pairs. An analysis of the spin susceptibility implies
that, because of the el-ph interaction, the imaginary part of the exchange
interaction has a sharp peak or dip at \pm\omega^*, where \omega^*\simeq
\omega_ph in the normal state and \epsilon_G/2 \lessim \omega^* \lessim

that a main contribution to the turbulence kinetic energy production in

with coherent structures is produced by shear, rather than by buoyancy. We
determined the scalings of global parameters (e.g., the production and

turbulent scale, the large-scale shear, etc.) of turbulent convection versus

discrete time and separable Hilbert spaces, in order to make them accessible to
those coming from the philosophy of science and not too happy with
idiosyncratic notation and terminology and sophisticated mathematical tools.
Conventional elementary mathematical descriptions of quantum mechanics take
""measurement"" to be a primitive concept. Paradoxes arise when we choose to
consider smaller or larger systems as measurement devices in their own right,
by making different and apparently arbitrary choices of location of the
""Heisenberg cut"". Various quantum interpretations have different resolutions of
the paradox. In Belavkin's approach, the classical world around us does really
exist, and it evolves stochastically and dynamically in time according to
probability laws following from successive applications of the Born law. It is
a collapse theory, and necessarily it is non-local. The quantum/classical
distinction is determined by the arrow of time. The underlying unitary
evolution of the wave-function of the universe enables the designation of a
collection of beables which grows as time evolves, and which therefore can be
assigned random, classical trajectories. In a slogan: the past is particles,
the future is a wave. We, living in the now, are located on the cutting edge
between past and future.

matrix element of a quark-antiquark bilocal light-cone operator in the
heavy-quark effective theory (HQET) and is a building block of QCD
factorization formula for exclusive $B$-meson decays. When the corresponding
bilocal HQET operator has a light-like distance $t$ between the quark and
antiquark fields, the scale $\sim 1/t$ separates the UV and IR regions, which
induce the cusp singularity in radiative corrections and the mixing of
multiparticle states in nonperturbative corrections, respectively. We treat the
bilocal HQET operator based on the operator product expansion (OPE),
disentangling the singularities from the IR and UV regions systematically. The
matching at the next-to-leading order $\alpha_s$ is performed in the
$\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme with a complete set of local operators of dimension
$d \le 5$, through a manifestly gauge-invariant calculation organizing all
contributions in the coordinate space. The result exhibits the Wilson
coefficients with Sudakov-type double logarithms and the higher-dimensional
operators with additional gluons. This OPE yields the $B$-meson LCDA for $t$
less than $\sim 1$ GeV$^{-1}$, in terms of $\bar{\Lambda}= m_B - m_b$ and the
two additional HQET parameters as matrix elements of dimension-5 operators. The

Influence of both magnetic and brane parameters on effective potential of the
radial motion of charged test particle around slowly rotating black hole in
braneworld immersed in uniform magnetic field has been investigated by using
Hamilton-Jacobi method. Exact analytical solution for dependence of the radius
of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) $r_{\rm ISCO}$ from brane
parameter for motion of test particle around nonrotating isolated black hole in
braneworld has been derived. It has been shown that radius $r_{\rm ISCO}$ is
monotonically growing with the increase of module of brane tidal charge.
Comparison of the predictions on $r_{\rm ISCO}$ of the brane world model and of
the observational results of ISCO from relativistic accretion disks around
black holes provided upper limit for brane tidal charge $\lesssim 10^9 {\rm

shed light upon the processes of knowledge sharing in destinations as they
strive to innovate. The paper conceptualizes destinations as networks of
connected organizations, both public and private, each of which can be
considered as a destination stakeholder. In network theory they represent the
nodes within the system. The paper shows how epidemic diffusion models can act
as an analogy for knowledge communication and transfer within a destination
network. These models can be combined with other approaches to network analysis
to shed light on how destination networks operate, and how they can be
optimized with policy intervention to deliver innovative and competitive
destinations. The paper closes with a practical tourism example taken from the
Italian destination of Elba. Using numerical simulations the case demonstrates
how the Elba network can be optimized. Overall this paper demonstrates the
considerable utility of network analysis for tourism in delivering destination
competitiveness.

electrons/positrons due to the clumpiness of dark matter distribution are
studied in detail in this work, taking the Sommerfeld effect into account. It
has been thought that the Sommerfeld effect, if exists, will be more remarkable
in substructures because they are colder than the host halo, and may result in
a larger boost factor. We give a full calculation of the boost factors based on
the recent N-body simulations. Three typical cases of Sommerfeld effects, the
non-resonant, moderately resonant and strongly resonant cases are considered.
We find that for the non-resonant and moderately resonant cases the enhancement
effects of substructures due to the Sommerfeld effect are very small ($\sim
\mathcal{O}(1)$) because of the saturation behavior of the Sommerfeld effect.
For the strongly resonant case the boost factor is typically smaller than $\sim
\mathcal{O}(10)$. However, it is possible in some very extreme cases that DM
distribution is adopted to give the maximal annihilation the boost factor can
reach up to $\sim 1000$. The variances of the boost factors due to different
realizations of substructures distribution are also discussed in the work.

falling particles can radiate other massive particles on the classical level as
seen by the free falling observer. The intensity of the radiation process is
non-zero even for particles with any finite mass, i.e. with a wavelength which
is within the causal domain. Hence, we conclude that either de Sitter space can
not exist eternally or that one can build a perpetuum mobile.
