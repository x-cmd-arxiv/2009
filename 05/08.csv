2-5 micron, is detected in a spectroscopic sample of 88 galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0
taken from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey. Line emission from polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) at 3.3 micron alone cannot explain the excess, which can be
fit by a spectral component consisting of a template of PAH emission lines
superposed on a modified blackbody of temperature T~850 K. The luminosity of
this near-infrared excess emission at 3 micron is found to be correlated with
the star formation rate of the galaxy. The origin of the near-infrared excess
is explored by examining similar excesses observed locally in massive star
forming regions, reflection and planetary nebulae, post-asymptotic giant branch
stars and in the galactic cirrus. We also consider the potential contribution
from dust heated around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We conclude that
the most likely explanation for the 2-5 micron excess is the contribution from
circumstellar disks around massive young stellar objects seen in the integrated
light of high-redshift galaxies. Assuming circumstellar disks extend down to
lower masses, as they do in our own Galaxy, the excess emission presents us
with an exciting opportunity to measure the formation rate of planetary systems
at cosmic epochs before our own solar system formed.

coupling as due to a relativistic precession of the electron spin axis.
Thomas's explanation required also that the total of the orbit-averaged, or
""secular"", orbital and spin angular momenta of the electron be a conserved
quantity, as he found to be the case for either of two possible equations of
translational motion of the magnetic electron. Thomas's finding is seen in the
present work to require the ""hidden momentum"" of the electron intrinsic
magnetic moment in the Coulomb field of the proton be omitted from its equation
of translational motion. Omission of the hidden momentum is contrary to the
position of standard modern electrodynamics texts, and leads to violation of
Newton's law of action and reaction, negating Thomas's result. Including the
hidden momentum results in linear momentum conservation, but in the presence of
Thomas precession, the total angular momentum is not generally conserved. The
total angular momentum precesses for non-aligned spin and orbit, even in the
absence of externally-applied magnetic field. As Thomas observes that secular
angular momentum conservation is a necessary condition for a consistent
simultaneous description of spin-orbit coupling and the anomalous Zeeman
effect, such is not possible within classical electrodynamics in its absence.

the values of selected spin observables. An effective equation of motion for
the atomic system is presented, and an approximate 2-parameter model of the
dynamics is developed that should provide a viable approach to modeling even
the extremely large spin systems, with N>>1 atoms, encountered under typical
laboratory conditions.
  Combining the nonlinear dynamics that result from the positive feedback with
continuous observation of the atomic spin offers an improvement in quantum
parameter estimation. We explore the possibility of reaching the Heisenberg
uncertainty scaling in atomic magnetometry without the need for any appreciable
spin-squeezing by analyzing our system via the quantum Cramer-Rao inequality.
Finally, we develop a realistic quantum parameter estimator for atomic
magnetometry that is based on a two-parameter family of Gaussian states and
investigate the performance of this estimator through numerical simulations. In
doing so, we identify several issues, such as numerical convergence and the
reduction of estimator bias, that must be addressed when incorporating our
parameter estimation methods into an actual laboratory setting.

stronger turbulent compression at the same RMS Mach number than solenoidal
forcing, resulting in a three times larger standard deviation of volumetric and
column density probability distributions (PDFs). We conclude that the strong

a quantitative description of this dependence. We find that different observed

existence of these compressible, non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes
requires that there be a maximum in the angular velocity $\Omega_\phi(r)$ of
the accreting material larger than the angular velocity of the star $\Omega_*$,
and that the fluid is in approximately circular motion near this maximum rather
than moving rapidly towards the star or out of the disk plane into funnel
flows. Our MHD simulations show this type of flow and $\Omega_\phi(r)$ profile.
The first mode is a Rossby wave instability (RWI) mode which is radially
trapped in the vicinity of the maximum of a key function $g(r){\cal F}(r)$ at
$r_{R}$. The real part of the angular frequency of the mode is
$\omega_r=m\Omega_\phi(r_{R})$, where $m=1,2...$ is the azimuthal mode number.
The second mode, is a mode driven by the rotating, non-axisymmetric component
of the star's magnetic field. It has an angular frequency equal to the star's
angular rotation rate $\Omega_*$. This mode is strongly excited near the radius
of the Lindblad resonance which is slightly outside of $r_R$. The third mode
arises naturally from the interaction of flow perturbation with the rotating
non-axisymmetric component of the star's magnetic field. It has an angular
frequency $\Omega_*/2$. We suggest that the first mode with $m=1$ is associated
with the upper QPO frequency, $\nu_u$; that the nonlinear interaction of the
first and second modes gives the lower QPO frequency, $\nu_\ell =\nu_u-\nu_*$;

expanding and cooling supernova remnant. Many SiC-X grains have been found to
be aggregates of smaller crystals which are isotopically homogenous. The
initial condensation of SiC in the ejecta occurs within a interior dense shell
of material which is created by a reverse shock which rebounds from the
core-envelope interface. A subsequent reverse shock accelerates the grains
forward, but the gas drag from the ejecta on the rapidly moving particles
limits their travel distance. By observing the effects of gas drag on the
travel distance of grains, we propose that supernova grain aggregates form from
material that condensed in a highly localized region, which satisfies the
observational evidence of isotopic homogeneity in SiC-X grains.

huge spherical underdense region - a ""Void"" - of a few hundreds Mpc/h radius.
Such a structure would have an impact on the CMB two-point (power spectrum) and
three-point (bispectrum) correlation functions not only at low-l, but also at
high-l through Lensing, which is a unique signature of a Void. Modeling such an
underdensity with an LTB metric, we show that for the power spectrum the effect
should be visible already in the WMAP data only if the Void radius is at least
L \gtrsim 1 Gpc/h, while it will be visible by the Planck satellite if L
\gtrsim 500 Mpc/h. We also speculate that this could be linked to the high-l
detection of an hemispherical power asymmetry in the sky. Moreover, there
should be non-zero correlations in the non-diagonal two-point function. For the
bispectrum, the effect becomes important for squeezed triangles with two very
high l's: this signal can be detected by Planck if the Void radius is at least
L \gtrsim 300 Mpc/h, while higher resolution experiments should be able to
probe the entire parameter space. We have also estimated the contamination of
the primordial non-Gaussianity f_NL due to this signal, which turns out to be
negligible.

surface remains poorly constrained by observations. Nevertheless it is believed
that large vacuum gaps exist in the magnetosphere, and a non-neutral plasma
partially fills the neutron star surroundings to form an electrosphere.
  The equatorial disk in this electrosphere is diocotron and magnetron
unstable. To better assess the long term evolution of these instabilities, we
study the behavior of the non-neutral plasma with help on particle simulations.
  We designed a 2D electrostatic PIC code. In the diocotron regime, the
equation of motion for particles obeys the electric drift approximation. The
plasma is confined between two conducting walls. Moreover, in order to simulate
a pair cascade in the gaps, we add a source term feeding the plasma with
charged particles.
  We consider the long term non-linear evolution of the diocotron instability.
We found that particles tend to attract together to form small vortex of high
charge density rotating around the axis of the cylinder with only little radial
excursion of the particles. This grouping of particles generates new low
density or even vacuum gaps in the plasma column. We show that particle
injection into the plasma can drastically increase the diffusion of particles
across the magnetic field lines. Also, the newly formed vacuum gaps cannot be
replenished by simply invoking the diocotron instability.

Assuming a moderately weak Fermi surface corrugation we showed that the
oscillating correction to the sound velocity may include a special term besides
an ordinary contribution originating from quantum oscillations of the charge
carriers density of states at the Fermi surface. This additional term is
generated by a ""phase stability"" resonance occurring when the charge carriers
velocity in the direction of the wave propagation equals the sound velocity.
The two oscillating contributions to the sound velocity are shown to differ in

scattering by the cloud on the X-ray energy and power spectra, concentrating on
the hard spectral state. The process reduces the energy of the high-energy

optical depth. This, together with the observed cut-off in the power spectrum,
determines the size of the plasma to be 2x10^9 cm. At this size, the cloud will
be in thermal equilibrium in the photon field of the X-ray source, which yields
the cloud temperature of 3 keV, which refines the determination of the Thomson
optical depth to 7. At these parameters, thermal bremsstrahlung emission of the
cloud becomes important as well. The physical origin of the cloud is likely to

RSG shell. The 28 $\Mo$ star explodes as a LBSG, and the SN blast wave
interacts with a low density, free streaming wind surrounded by an unstable and
massive ''RSG+LBSG'' shell. Finally, the 30 and 33 \Mo stars explode as WR
stars surrounded by fast, WR winds that terminate in highly fragmented ''WR+RSG

whether the goal is instead to find an optimal compromise between sequence
similarity and interaction conservation in the alignment. We propose new

visible and extending into the ultraviolet is thought to be dominated by
starlight, either through direct emission or through absorption and reradiation
by dust. This is the most important energy range for absorbing $\g$-rays from
distant sources such as blazars and gamma-ray bursts and producing electron
positron pairs. In previous work we presented EBL models in the optical through
ultraviolet by consistently taking into account the star formation rate (SFR),
initial mass function (IMF) and dust extinction, and treating stars on the main
sequence as blackbodies. This technique is extended to include post-main
sequence stars and reprocessing of starlight by dust. In our simple model, the
total energy absorbed by dust is assumed to be re-emitted as three blackbodies
in the infrared, one at 40 K representing warm, large dust grains, one at 70 K
representing hot, small dust grains, and one at 450 K representing polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons. We find our best fit model combining the Hopkins and
Beacom SFR using the Cole et al. parameterization with the Baldry and
Glazebrook IMF agrees with available luminosity density data at a variety of
redshifts. Our resulting EBL energy density is quite close to the lower limits
from galaxy counts and in some cases below the lower limits, and agrees fairly
well with other recent EBL models shortward of about 5 $\mu$m. Deabsorbing TeV
$\g$-ray spectra of various blazars with our EBL model gives results consistent
with simple shock acceleration theory. We also find that the universe should be
optically thin to $\g$-rays with energies less than 20 GeV.

whether CP(A) is finitely based for every (unitary) associative algebra A with
nonzero T-ideal of identities that is properly contained CP(A). V. V.
Shchigolev (2001) showed that for any field k of characteristic zero, every
T-space of the infinite dimensional free associative k algebra is finitely
based, and it follows from this that every T-space of the infinite dimensional
free unitary k algebra is also finitely based. This more than answers Okhitin's
question (in the affirmative) for fields of characteristic zero.
  For a field of characteristic 2, the infinite-dimensional Grassmann algebras,
unitary and nonunitary, are commutative and thus the T-space of central
polynomials of each is finitely based.
  We shall show in the following that if p is a prime greater than 2 and k is
an arbitrary field of characteristic p, then the T-space of central polynomials
of the infinite dimension free (unitary or otherwise) associative algebra is
finitely based, thus providing a negative answer to Okhitin's question.

quantum Toffoli gates, including empty space itself. Empty space can be
configured into photon or matter gates simply by swapping logic input
information with these entities through the phenomenon of quantum mechanical
entanglement between photons and empty space Toffoli gates. The essential
difference between empty space, photons and matter gates are the logic input
values of their respective Toffoli gates. Empty space is characterized by an
inability for the logic inputs to influence the internal logic state of its
Toffoli gates since the control lines are set to logic 0. Photons and matter
are characterized by Toffoli gates where the control lines are set to logic 1
enabling their logic inputs to control their internal logic states allowing for
their interaction according to the laws of physics associated with reality.
Photons swapping logic input information with empty space results in the
propagation of light. Photons facilitating the swapping of information between
matter and empty space gates leads to the laws of motion including relativity.
This model enables the derivation of many physical laws from purely quantum
mechanical considerations including the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the
Lorentz transformations of special relativity, and the relationship between
relativistic energy and mass. The model provides a possible explanation for
many physical phenomena including dark matter, anti-matter, and an inflationary

gravitational lensing, this galaxy is magnified by a factor of > 10, allowing
in-depth measurements which are usually unfeasible at such redshifts. In the
optical spectra, we measured the systemic redshift of the galaxy, z = 2.7322
+/- 0.0012, using stellar photospheric lines. This differs from the redshift of
absorption lines in the interstellar medium, z = 2.7302 +/- 0.0006, implying
gas outflows on the order of 160 km/s. With H and K-band near-infrared spectra,
we have measured nebular emission lines of Halpha, Hbeta, Hgamma, [N II] and [O
III], which have a redshift z = 2.7333 +/- 0.0001, consistent with the derived
systemic redshift. From the Balmer decrement, we measured the dust extinction
to be A_5500 = 1.17 +/- 0.36 mag. Correcting Halpha for dust extinction and the
assumed lensing factor, we measure a star-formation rate of ~ 270 Msol/yr,
which is higher than ~ 85% of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. Using
combinations of all detected emission lines, we find that the 8 o'clock arc has
a gas-phase metallicity of ~ 0.8 Zsol, showing that enrichment at high-redshift
is not rare, even in blue, star-forming galaxies. Studying spectra from two of
the arc components separately, we find that one component dominates the dust
extinction and star-formation rate, although the metallicities between the two
components are similar. We derive the mass via stellar population modeling, and
find that the arc has a total stellar mass of ~ 4 x 10^11 Msol, which falls on
the mass-metallicity relation at z ~ 2. Finally, we estimate the total gas
mass, and find it to be only ~ 12% of the stellar mass, implying that the 8
o'clock arc is likely nearing the end of a starburst.

below L_I/L_Edd ~ 0.01, despite simulations of synthetic spectra which show
that the survey is sensitive to such Type 1 AGN. At lower accretion rates the
BLR may become obscured, diluted or nonexistent. We find evidence that Type 1
AGN at higher accretion rates have higher optical luminosities, as more of
their emission comes from the cool (optical) accretion disk with respect to
shorter wavelengths. We measure a larger range in accretion rate than previous
works, suggesting that COSMOS is more efficient at finding low accretion rate
Type 1 AGN. However the measured range in accretion rate is still comparable to
the intrinsic scatter from the scaling relations, suggesting that Type 1 AGN

silicates are seen in just two objects, enforcing the now well-known-fact that
oxygen-rich dust is less common at low metallicities. Besides these common

strong silicon carbide feature at 11um and twelve of them show magnesium
sulfide emission starting at 25um. The high percentage of spectra with silicon
carbide in the Magellanic Clouds is not common. Two objects show a broad band
which may be attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon and weak

supersolid phase at a fermionic band-filling of $n_f = 3/4$ with a Kagome-type

structure characterized by voids and high density filaments that resemble those
observed by the Parkes HI survey. As a consequence of the very recent edge-on
motion, the H-alpha emission is mainly concentrated on the eastern side where
30 Doradus and most of the supergiant shells are located, although some H-alpha

is significantly stronger than can be expected from the compression of the

Additionally, the polarization is mainly radial, which is also contrary to
expectation from compression of the CSM magnetic field. Cosmic rays (CRs) may
help to explain these two observed features. They can increase the compression
ratio to factors well over those of regular strong shocks by adding a
relativistic plasma component to the pressure, and by draining the shock of
energy when CRs escape from the region. The higher compression ratio will also
allow for the contact discontinuity, which is subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor
(R-T) instability, to reach much further out to the forward shock. This could
create a preferred radial polarization of the magnetic field. With an adaptive
mesh refinement MHD code (AMRVAC), we simulate the evolution of SNRs with three
different configurations of the initial CSM magnetic field, and look at two
different equations of state in order to look at the possible influence of a CR
plasma component. The spectrum of CRs can be simulated using test particles, of

coupled to abelian gauge fields with negative cosmological constant that has
been proposed as the dual theory to a Lifshitz theory describing critical
phenomena in (2+1) dimensions. These black holes are all asymptotic to a
Lifshitz fixed point geometry and depend on a single parameter that determines
both their area (or size) and their charge. Most of the solutions are obtained
numerically, but an exact solution is also obtained for a particular value of
this parameter. The thermodynamic behaviour of large black holes is almost the
same regardless of genus, but differs considerably for small black holes.
Screening behaviour is exhibited in the dual theory for any genus, but the
critical length at which it sets in is genus-dependent for small black holes.

incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the Fokker-Planck equation has been
studied intensively, mostly with the zero flux boundary condition. Recently it
was illustrated by C. Liu and H. Liu [2008, SIAM J. Appl. Math.,
68(5):1304--1315] that any preassigned boundary value of a weighted
distribution will become redundant once the non-dimensional parameter $b>2$. In
this article, we show that for the well-posedness of the microscopic FENE model
($b>2$) the least boundary requirement is that the distribution near boundary
needs to approach zero faster than the distance function. Under this condition,
it is shown that there exists a unique weak solution in a weighted Sobolev
space. Moreover, such a condition still ensures that the distribution is a
probability density. The sharpness of this boundary requirement is shown by a
construction of infinitely many solutions when the distribution approaches zero
as fast as the distance function.

decreases in favor of a rise in the occupancy of the lattice sites at the edges

per particle at certain optical depths is insensitive to the number of

observable $\Theta$ as a function of the control variables. In this work
control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are
analyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density
matrix $\rho_{\rm i}$ into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation
value of the observable $\Theta$. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for
the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of
the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the
system $N$, the initial state $\rho_{\rm i}$, and the target observable
$\Theta$. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in $\rho_{\rm
i}$ remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant
dependence on $N$. If $\rho_{\rm i}$ has no zero eigenvalues, then the
computational complexity and the required search effort rise with $N$. The
dimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes
the objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search
efficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control
modelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value
of the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps. Numerical
simulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints
on the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these
landscapes.

emission is closely related to the location of the ionized gas, while the 8

consistently with its expected association with photodissociation regions

formation for these objects than the dust luminosities by themselves. For NGC
604, we obtain and compare extinction maps derived from the Balmer decrement

locally different values in extinction, we find similar integrated extinctions
derived from the two methods. We also investigate here the possible existence
of embedded star formation within NGC 604.

  Despite this problem we study to what extent could a bijective classical
correspondence between this theory and the (presumably consistent)
non-polynomial theory exist. We find that the classical equivalence between
these two theories can almost be extended to the Ramond sector: We construct
mappings between the string fields (NS and Ramond, including Chan-Paton factors
and the various GSO sectors) of the two theories that send solutions to
solutions in a way that respects the linearized gauge symmetries in both sides
and keeps the action of the solutions invariant. The perturbative spectrum
around equivalent solutions is also isomorphic.
  The problem with the cubic theory implies that the correspondence of the
linearized gauge symmetries cannot be extended to a correspondence of the
finite gauge symmetries. Hence, our equivalence is only formal, since it
relates a consistent theory to an inconsistent one. Nonetheless, we believe
that the fact that the equivalence formally works suggests that a consistent
modification of the cubic theory exists. We construct a theory that can be
considered as a first step towards a consistent RNS cubic theory.

with mid-point insertions in the action, such as the modified cubic theory can
be well behaved, even if this mid-point insertion has a non-trivial kernel.
  We then discuss the recent proposal by Berkovits and Siegel of a non-minimal
superstring field theory. In this theory the action contains a mid-point
insertion of a non-zero conformal weight. We show that, while this is a-priori
a problem, it might be possible (in the NS sector) to make sense out of this
theory by regularizing it. A cleaner resolution of the problem is to extend the
non-minimal sector in a way that allows a zero-weight mid-point insertion with
the desired properties. We also study the generalisation of the theory to the
NS- sector and explain the problems with defining the Ramond sectors.
  We show that the non-minimal theory supports all the known solutions of the
standard modified cubic superstring field theory, including the GSO+ vacuum
solution. The properties of the solutions carry over to the non-minimal theory.
In particular, the vacuum solution has the correct tension and cohomology.

comparing the colours of MSX and 2MASS point sources to those of known MYSOs.
Aims: To identify the populations of UCHII regions and PNe within the sample
and examine their Galactic distribution. Method: We have conducted high
resolution radio continuum observations at 6 cm towards 659 MYSO candidates in
the northern hemisphere ($10\degr< l < 250\degr$) using the VLA. In addition to
these targeted observations we present archival data towards a further 315 RMS
sources extracted from a previous VLA survey of the inner Galaxy. Results: We
find radio emission towards 272 ($\sim$27% of the observed sample). Using
results from other parts of our multi-wavelength survey we separate these
RMS-radio associations into two distinct types of objects, classifying 51 as
PNe and a further 208 as either compact or UC HII regions. Using this well
selected sample of HII regions we estimate their Galactic scale height to be
0.6\degr. Conclusions: Using radio continuum and archival data we have
identified 79 PNe and 391 HII regions within the northern RMS catalogue. We
estimate the total fraction of contamination by PNe in the RMS sample is of
order 10%. The sample of HII regions is probably the best representation to
date of the Galactic population of HII regions as a whole.

proof-of-principle nanofluidic applications, particularly those involving
manipulation of biomolecules or sequencing of DNA. The only practical way of
manipulating charged macromolecules near nanopores is through a voltage
difference applied across the nanopore-spanning membrane. However, recent
experiments have shown that salt concentration gradients applied across
nanopores can also dramatically enhance charged particle capture from a low
concentration reservoir of charged molecules at one end of the nanopore. This
puzzling effect has hitherto eluded a physically consistent theoretical
explanation. Here, we propose an electrokinetic mechanism of this enhanced
capture that relies on the electrostatic potential near the pore mouth. For
long pores with diameter much greater than the local screening length, we
obtain accurate analytic expressions showing how salt gradients control the
local conductivity which can lead to increased local electrostatic potentials
and charged analyte capture rates. We also find that the attractive
electrostatic potential may be balanced by an outward, repulsive electroosmotic
flow (EOF) that can in certain cases conspire with the salt gradient to further
enhance the analyte capture rate.

distribution (SED) is similar to that of other bright radio-quiet quasars,
contrary to an earlier claim. (2) A dusty torus model with a small opening
angle fits the overall shape of the IR SED well, but the quantitative agreement
is poor due to an offset in wavelength of the silicate feature. (3) The flux
ratios of the four lensed images can be derived from the IRAC data despite
being unresolved. We find that the near-IR fluxes are increasingly affected by
microlensing toward shorter wavelengths. (4) The wavelength dependence of the
IRAC flux ratios is consistent with the standard quasar model in which an
accretion disk and a dusty torus both contribute near 1 micron in the rest
frame. This is also consistent with recent IR spectropolarimetry of nearby

used in applications of the AdS/CFT correspondence to strong interaction and
condensed matter physics, have temperatures with positive lower bounds. There
are two distinct effects involved. For low chemical potentials in the dual
field theory, the cooling black hole makes a transition to a state
corresponding to confinement in the field theory. For high chemical potentials,
it becomes unstable to a non-perturbative string effect. This allows a
holographic sketch of the field theory phase diagram, one which is in
qualitative agreement with the phenomenological understanding of the theory at
[relatively] low temperatures. It also puts an interesting upper bound on the
temperature-normalized chemical potential $\bar{\mu}$ of the field theory, if
it describes a plasma: in the normalization of Myers et al., $\bar{\mu}$ must
be less than approximately 0.49. Thus, the extent to which a chemical potential
can worsen violations of the KSS bound is severely restricted.

frequently used in applications, a detailed study of its properties is still
missing. This sharply contrasts the progress of the theory of Tikhonov
regularization, where a series of new results for regularization in Banach
spaces has been published in the recent years. The present paper intends to
bridge the gap between the existing theories as far as possible. We develop a
stability and convergence theory for the residual method in general topological
spaces. In addition, we prove convergence rates in terms of (generalized)
Bregman distances, which can also be applied to non-convex regularization
functionals. We provide three examples that show the applicability of our
theory. The first example is the regularized solution of linear operator
equations on $L^p$-spaces, where we show that the results of Tikhonov
regularization generalize unchanged to the residual method. As a second
example, we consider the problem of density estimation from a finite number of
sampling points, using the Wasserstein distance as a fidelity term and an
entropy measure as regularization term. It is shown that the densities obtained
in this way depend continuously on the location of the sampled points and that
the underlying density can be recovered as the number of sampling points tends
to infinity. Finally, we apply our theory to compressed sensing. Here, we show
the well-posedness of the method and derive convergence rates both for convex

China, 4300 m a.s.l.), active surface (about 6700 m**2 of Resistive Plate
Chambers), and large field of view (about 2 sr, limited only by the atmospheric

detection of unpredictable and short duration events such as GRBs. The search
is carried out using the ""single particle technique"", i.e. counting all the
particles hitting the detector without measurement of the energy and arrival
direction of the primary gamma rays.
  Between 2004 December 17 and 2009 April 7, 81 GRBs detected by satellites
occurred within the field of view of ARGO-YBJ (zenith angle < 45 deg). It was
possible to examine 62 of these for >1 GeV counterpart in the ARGO-YBJ data
finding no statistically significant emission. With a lack of detected spectra
in this energy range fluence upper limits are profitable, especially when the
redshift is known and the correction for the extragalactic absorption can be
considered. The obtained fluence upper limits reach values as low as 10**{-5}
erg cm**{-2} in the 1-100 GeV energy region.
  Besides this individual search for a higher energy counterpart, a statistical
study of the stack of all the GRBs both in time and in phase was made, looking
for a common feature in the GRB high energy emission. No significant signal has
been detected.

diffusion process of small particles. However, we prove that a dynamical
network facilitates the transport of large particles. By weighting the mean
square displacement trajectories of particles in the static chain network data
from the dynamical network can be reconstructed. Additionally, it is shown that
subdiffusive behaviour of particles on short time scales results from trapping

Fresnel Zone Lens (FZL) that cancels the dispersion and a detector. An
additional module collimates the artificial targets of various shapes, sizes

primary Fresnel array, and the cophased Fresnel Zone Lens that achieves
rigorous chromatic correction. We give quantitative measurements of the
diffraction limited performances and dynamic range on double sources. The tests
have been performed in the visible domain, lambda = 400 - 700 nm.

that if the Lie algebras of smooth sections of two Atiyah algebroids are
isomorphic, then the corresponding base manifolds are necessarily
diffeomorphic. Further, we give two characterizations of the isomorphisms of
the Lie algebras of sections for Atiyah algebroids associated to principle
bundles with semisimple structure groups. For instance we prove that in the
semisimple case the Lie algebras of sections are isomorphic if and only if the
corresponding Lie algebroids are, or, as well, if and only if the integrating
principal bundles are locally diffeomorphic. Finally, we apply these results to
describe the isomorphisms of sections in the case of reductive structure groups
-- surprisingly enough they are no longer determined by vector bundle
isomorphisms and involve divergences on the base manifolds.

very sensitive to the difference $\Delta h =h-\tilde{h}$ of the Hubble constant

the likelihood of parameter $w_a$ has a high non-Gaussian distribution; (f) an
extra restriction on $\Omega_M$ is necessary to improve the constraint of the

to break the degeneracy between $w$ and $\Omega_M$, and it provides a stringent
constrain with the likelihoods: $w = -0.88^{+0.07}_{-0.09}$ and
$\Omega_M=0.29^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$. For the time-varying $w(z)$, it leads to the
interesting maximum likelihoods $w_0 = -0.94$ and $w_a = 0$. When marginalizing

step, the agent, before moving and after exploration around the current state,
compares intermediate advantages and costs to change to advantages and costs to
stay. These advantages and costs to change include goal-setting, psychological,
cognitive, learning and inertia aspects. Acceptables moves are such that
advantages to move than to stay are higher than some fraction of costs to move
than to stay, with, as a result, a limitation of the intermediate sacrifices to
reach the goal. When the agent is more goal-oriented and improves enough at
each step, the process ends in a permanent routine, a rest point where the
agent prefers to stay than to change, in spite of some possible residual
frustration to have missed his goal. In case of high local costs to move this
approach leads to a cognitive proof of Ekeland epsilon-variational principle.
The as if hypothesis (as if agents would optimize) is revisited, leading to the
introduction of a new class of optimization algorithm with inertia, the local

structure of the outer atmospheric layers as one moves to later spectral types

coronal emission diminishes and a cool massive wind steps in.
  Aims: Where most studies have focussed on short-wavelength observations, this
article explores the influence of the chromosphere and the wind on
long-wavelength photometric measurements.
  Methods: The observational spectral energy distributions are compared with
the theoretical predictions of the MARCS atmosphere models for a sample of 9 K-
and M-giants. The discrepancies found are explained using basic models for flux
emission originating from a chromosphere or an ionized wind.
  Results: For 7 out of 9 sample stars, a clear flux excess is detected at
(sub)millimeter and/or centimeter wavelengths. The precise start of the excess
depends upon the star under consideration. The flux at wavelengths shorter than
about 1 mm is most likely dominated by an optically thick chromosphere, where
an optically thick ionized wind is the main flux contributor at longer
wavelengths.
  Conclusions: Although the optical to mid-infrared spectrum of the studied K-
and M-giants is well represented by a radiative equilibrium atmospheric model,
the presence of a chromosphere and/or ionized stellar wind at higher altitudes
dominates the spectrum in the (sub)millimeter and centimeter wavelength ranges.
The presence of a flux excess also has implications on the role of these stars
as fiducial spectrophotometric calibrators in the (sub)millimeter and
centimeter wavelength range.

mechanisms of elastic response and attenuation of acoustic modes in granular

properties of the granular medium that are the cause of the changes in acoustic
properties of structures containing grain-filled cavities. Specifically, we
apply this understanding to the case of the flexural resonances of a
rectangular bar with a grain-filled cavity within it. The dominant features of
$\tilde{M}(\omega)$ are a sharp resonance and a broad background, which we
analyze within the context of simple models. We find that: a) These systems may
be understood in terms of a height-dependent and diameter-dependent effective
sound speed ($\sim 100-300$ m/s) and an effective viscosity ($\sim 5\times
10^4$ Poise). b) There is a dynamic Janssen effect in the sense that, at any
frequency, and depending on the method of sample preparation, approximately
one-half of the effective mass is borne by the side walls of the cavity and
one-half by the bottom. c) By performing experiments under varying humidity
conditions we conclude that, on a fundamental level, damping of acoustic modes
is dominated by adsorbed films of water at grain-grain contacts in our
experiments, not by global viscous dampening. d) There is a monotonically
increasing effect of humidity on the dampening of the fundamental resonance
within the granular medium which translates to a non-monotonic, but
predictable, variation of dampening within the grain-loaded bar.

physics. The new fields of the dark matter sector have no hadronic charges and
couple only to leptons. Our model can not only give rise to the observed
neutrino mass hierarchy, but can also generate the baryon number asymmetry via
non-thermal leptogenesis. The breaking of the new U(1)' symmetry produces
cosmic strings. The dark matter particles are produced non-thermally from
cosmic string loop decay which allows one to obtain sufficiently large
annihilation cross sections to explain the observed cosmic ray positron and
electron fluxes recently measured by the PAMELA, ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi-LAT, and
HESS experiments while maintaining the required overall dark matter energy
density. The high velocity of the dark matter particles from cosmic string loop
decay leads to a low phase space density and thus to a dark matter profile with
a constant density core in contrast to what happens in a scenario with
thermally produced cold dark matter where the density keeps rising towards the
center. As a result, the flux of gamma rays radiated from the final leptonic
states of dark matter annihilation from the Galactic center is suppressed and
satisfies the constraints from the HESS gamma-ray observations.

bursts, the first seen from this AXP in >11 years of Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer monitoring, all occurred in the interval between 2006 April 6 and 2007
February 7. The burst durations ranged from 0.4-1.8\times103 s. The first five
burst spectra are well modeled by blackbodies, with temperatures kT ~ 2-9 keV.
However, the sixth burst had a complicated spectrum that is well characterized
by a blackbody plus two emission features whose amplitude varied throughout the
burst. The most prominent feature was at 14.0 keV. Upon entry into the active
phase the pulsar showed a significant change in pulse morphology and a likely
timing glitch. The glitch had a total frequency jump of (1.9\pm0.4)\times10-7
Hz, which recovered with a decay time of 17\pm 2 days by more than the initial
jump, implying a net spin-down of the pulsar. Within the framework of the
magnetar model, the net spin-down of the star could be explained by regions of
the superfluid that rotate slower than the rest. The bursts, flux enhancements,
and pulse morphology changes can be explained as arising from crustal
deformations due to stresses imposed by the highly twisted internal magnetic
field. However, unlike other AXP outbursts, we cannot account for a major twist
being implanted in the magnetosphere.

enforced for the time-independent case are: Galilean covariance, zero net force

translational covariance, zero net force, the Levy-Perdew virial theorem and
energy balance. We test our method on the exchange Krieger-Li-Iafrate (xKLI)
approximate-optimized effective potential (AOEP), for both cases. For the
time-independent case, we calculated the ground state properties of some
hydrogen chains and small sodium clusters, for some constrained xKLI potentials
and Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange. The results indicate that enforcing the exact
conditions is not important for these cases. On the other hand, in the case,
constraining both energy balance and zero net force yields improved results
relative to TDHF calculations. We explored the electron dynamics in small
sodium clusters driven by CW laser pulses. For each laser pulse we compared
calculations from TD constrained xKLI, TD partially constrained xKLI and TDHF.
We found that electron dynamics like elec-tron ionization and moment of inertia
dynamics for the constrained xKLI are most similar to the TDHF results. Also,
energy conservation is better by at least an order of magnitude with respect to
the unconstrained xKLI. We also discuss the problems that arise in satisfying

(1000 M_sun) black hole, and means that in some ULXs the variability is
significantly suppressed compared to bright BHBs and AGN. We discuss ways to
account for this unusual suppression in terms of both observational and
intrinsic effects and whether these solutions are supported by our results.

four LINERs observed with Swift, aimed at constructing good S/N and strictly
simultaneous UV-X-ray SEDs. In the current paradigm, LINER emission is
dominated by geometrically thick, radiatively inefficient radiation flows
(RIAFs) as opposed to radiatively efficient, geometrically thin accretion disks
thought to power higher luminosity AGNs (Seyferts and QSOs). However, some
recent studies have found more similarities than differences between the SEDs
of LINERs and those of more luminous AGNs, suggesting that LINERs are powered
by the same mechanisms active in higher luminosity AGNs. Our new observations
allow us to test this idea. In particular, XRT affords long and sensitive
monitoring of the X-ray emission. We detect significant variability in M81 and,
for the first time, in NGC 3998. The maximum amplitude variations over time
scales of some hours are 30% in both M81 and NGC 3998. NGC 3998 exhibits a
variation of the same amplitude on a time scale of 9 days. M81 varies
significantly over 2 years, with a maximum change of a factor 2 in 6 months.
The X-ray variability detected in 2 of our sources, and in particular in NGC
3998, puts into question the interpretation of their powering mechanism as an
inefficient accretion flow, because one of the characteristics of this model is
the lack of variability. The identification of NGC 3998 with a low power AGN
appears more viable.

the more simple beta-form: only crystallites are formed, where the chain axis

path used. With real-time traffic data regarding travel times, it is important
to analyze how to use the information provided. In particular, can a Wardrop
equilibrium be realized? Simulations using the three-phase model on a two-route
example are presented to answer this question. One route (the main line) is a
two-lane highway with a stalled vehicle in the right lane and the other route
is a low-speed bypass. For a critical incoming flow, a phase transition between
free flow and congested flow near the stalled vehicle is observed, making this
a challenging example. In the first scenario, drivers choose routes selfishly
on the basis of current travel times. The result is strong oscillations in
travel time because of the inherent delay in the information provided. The
second scenario involves a hypothetical control system that limits the number
of vehicles on the main line to prevent the free-flow to congested-flow phase
transition by diverting sufficient flow to the bypass. The resulting steady
state is neither a Wardrop equilibrium nor a system optimum, but an
intermediate state in which the main-line travel time is less than on the
bypass but the average for all vehicles is close to a minimum. In a third
scenario, anticipation is used as a driver-advice system to provide a fair
indicator of which route to take. Prediction is based on real-time data
comparing the number of vehicles on the main line at the time a vehicle leaves
the origin to the actual travel time when it reaches the destination. Steady
states that approximate Wardrop equilbria, or close to them, are obtained.
