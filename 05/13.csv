the cosmic microwave background (CMB) as it propagates from the surface of last
scatter. In the simplest scenario, the rotation will be uniform across the sky,
but the rotation angle may also vary across the sky. We develop in detail the
complete set of full-sky quadratic estimators for the rotation of the CMB
polarization that can be constructed from the CMB temperature and polarization.
We derive the variance with which these estimators can be measured and show
that these variances reduce to the simpler flat-sky expressions in the
appropriate limit. We evaluate the variances numerically. While the flat-sky
formalism may be suitable if the rotation angle arises as a realization of a
random field, the full-sky formalism will be required to search for rotations
that vary slowly across the sky as well as for models in which the angular
power spectrum for the rotation angle peaks at large angles.

effective Lagrangian beyond the MSSM. While the leading nonrenormalizable
operators can shift the Higgs boson mass above the experimental bound, they
also tend to render the scalar potential unbounded from below. The
destabilization is correlated with the Higgs mass increase, so that if quantum
corrections are small the problem is severe. We show that a supersymmetric
sub-leading correction stabilizes the potential within the domain of validity
of the effective theory. Constraints on MSSM parameters as well as on higher
dimensional operators are derived, ensuring that our vacuum has a lifetime
longer than the present age of the universe. In addition we show that when
effective operators are responsible for evading the LEP bound, stability
constraints imply an upper bound on the scale of new physics in the few TeV

the hyperfine spontaneous decay rate is 680 times larger. Furthermore, the
antenna temperature is much lower at the frequencies relevant for the ^3He^+

temperature of this 8.7 GHz line in the intergalactic medium is approximately
the cosmic microwave background temperature, such that this transition is best
observed in absorption against high-redshift, radio-bright quasars. We show
that intergalactic 8.7 GHz absorption is a promising, unsaturated observable of
the ionization history of intergalactic helium (for which HeII->HeIII
reionization is believed to be complete at z~3) and of the primordial 3He

example, we consider the minimum mean squared-error distortion when encoding
the sum of jointly Gaussian random variables under these constraints. We also
characterize the rates needed to reconstruct a function of X and Y losslessly.
  Our general contribution toward understanding the limits of the cascade
multiterminal source coding network is in the form of inner and outer bounds on
the achievable rate region for satisfying a distortion constraint for an
arbitrary distortion function d(x,y,z). The inner bound makes use of a balance
between two encoding tactics--relaying the information about X and
recompressing the information about X jointly with Y. In the Gaussian case, a
threshold is discovered for identifying which of the two extreme strategies
optimizes the inner bound. Relaying outperforms recompressing the sum at the
relay for some rate pairs if the variance of X is greater than the variance of

obtained directly from numerical simulations of self-gravitating disks around

can, in principle, simulate the effect of GI in stellar systems with \xi <=

was based on a different \alpha-parameterization. In particular, the Kratter et
al's \alpha-parameterization has proven superior to that of Lin & Pringle's,
because the success of the latter depends crucially on the proper choice of the
\alpha-parameter. However, the \alpha-parameterization generally fails in
stellar systems with \xi >= 0.3, particularly in the Class 0 and Class I phases
of stellar evolution, yielding too small stellar masses and too large
disk-to-star mass ratios. The failure of the \alpha-parameterization in the
case of large \xi is caused by a growing strength of low-order spiral modes in
massive disks.

the host (acute) and those that persist (chronic). Why some viruses establish
chronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is
that the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is
unable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently
proposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T
cells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes
a chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing
efficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of
the infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector
CD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the
chronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T
cells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the
killing efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing
efficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the
memory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in
the chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a
target cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that
persistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an
efficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient
CD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent
infection.

the jet cross section measurement in $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV p+p collisions scaled

revealed highly depleted CO and somewhat enriched CH3OH compared with
abundances observed in the dominant group of long-period (Oort cloud) comets in
our sample and similar to those observed recently in Comet 8P/Tuttle. This may
indicate highly efficient H-atom addition to CO at very low temperature (~ 10 -
20 K) on the surfaces of interstellar (pre-cometary) grains. Comet C/2006 M4
had nearly ""normal"" C2H6 and CH4, suggesting a processing history similar to
that experienced by the dominant group. When compared with estimated water
production at the time of the millimeter observations, HCN was slightly
depleted compared with the normal abundance in comets based on IR observations
but was consistent with the majority of values from the millimeter. The ratio
CS/HCN in C/2006 M4 was within the range measured in ten comets at millimeter

reveals that there are no conducting edge states near zero energy, indicating
an insulator state with zero conductance. Consequently, the resistivity should
diverge at Dirac point. Interestingly, the $\nu=0$ insulating state can be
destroyed by disorder scattering with intermediate strength, where a metallic

at investigating whether stable hydrogen burning may constitute a main source
of energy for massive He-core white dwarfs resulting from high-metallicity

evolutionary history of progenitor stars with supersolar metallicities. We also
incorporate a self-consistent, time-dependent treatment of gravitational
settling and chemical diffusion, as well as of the residual nuclear burning. We
find that the influence of residual nuclear burning during the late stages of
white dwarf evolution is strongly dependent on the occurrence of chemical
diffusion at the base of the hydrogen-rich envelope. When no diffusion is
considered, residual hydrogen burning strongly influences the advanced stages
of white dwarf cooling, introducing evolutionary delays of several Gyr. By
contrast, when diffusion is taken into account the role of residual nuclear
burning is strongly mitigated, and the evolution is dictated only by the
thermal content stored in the ions. In addition, for all of our sequences, we
provide accurate color and magnitudes on the basis of new and improved non gray

in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric U(N) Yang-Mills theory. When the contours lie on
a two-sphere in the space-time, we propose a closed expression that is valid
for all values of the coupling constant $g$ and for any rank $N$, by exploiting
the suspected relation with two-dimensional gauge theories. We check this
formula perturbatively at order ${\cal O}(g^4)$ for two latitude Wilson loops
and we show that, in the limit where one of the loops shrinks to a point,
logarithmic corrections in the shrinking radius are absent at ${\cal O}(g^6)$.
This last result strongly supports the validity of our general expression and
suggests the existence of a peculiar protected local operator arising in the
OPE of the Wilson loop. At strong coupling we compare our result to the string
dual of the ${\cal N}=4$ SYM correlator in the limit of large separation,
presenting some preliminary evidence for the agreement.

yields an extremely precise position of RA(2000)=12:36:51.99 and
Dec(2000)=+62:12:25.83 with a 1-sigma positional uncertainty of 0.17 arcsec.
The position is consistent with the location of a millimeter wavelength
interferometric detection and with the locations of weak VLA detections at 1.4
and 8.4 GHz, but it is not consistent with any previous optical/near-infrared
identifications. The source appears pointlike at the 2 arcsec resolution of the
SMA, and the detected flux of 7.8+/-1.0 mJy is consistent with the measured
SCUBA fluxes. We tabulate fluxes and limits on HDF 850.1 at other wavelengths.
Our redshift estimate for HDF 850.1 based on the radio through mid-infrared
measurements is z=4.1. The faintness of the source at optical/near-infrared
wavelengths and the high estimated redshift suggest that HDF 850.1 may be an
analog of the brighter submillimeter source GOODS 850-5, which is also thought
to be at z>4. The fact that a source like HDF 850.1 should have appeared in one
of the very first blank-field SCUBA observations ever made suggests that such
high-redshift sources are quite common. Thus, we are led to conclude that
high-redshift star formation is dominated by giant dusty star-forming galaxies,
just as it is at lower redshifts.

cross section over its standard value to match the observations, we show that
it immediately implies an observable level of gamma-ray emission for the Fermi
telescope from nearby galaxy clusters such as Virgo and Fornax. We show that
this DM model implies a peculiar feature from final state radiation that is a
distinctive signature of DM. Using the EGRET upper limit on the gamma-ray
emission from Virgo, we constrain the minimum mass of substructures within DM
halos to be > 5x10^-3 M_sun -- about four orders of magnitudes larger than the
expectation for cold dark matter. This limits the cutoff scale in the linear
matter power spectrum to k < 35/kpc which can be explained by e.g., warm dark
matter. Very near future Fermi observations will strongly constrain the minimum
mass to be > 10^3 M_sun: if the true substructure cutoff is much smaller than
this, the DM interpretation of the Fermi/PAMELA/HESS data must be wrong. To
address the problem of astrophysical foregrounds, we performed high-resolution,
cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters that include realistic cosmic ray
(CR) physics. We compute the dominating gamma-ray emission signal resulting
from hadronic CR interactions and find that it follows a universal spectrum and
spatial distribution. If we neglect the anomalous enhancement factor and assume
standard values for the cross section and minimum subhalo mass, the same model
of DM predicts comparable levels of the gamma-ray emission from DM
annihilations and CR interactions. This suggests that spectral subtraction
techniques could be applied to detect the annihilation signal.

extreme-ultraviolet radiation. The presence of X-ray ionised dense clumps or

temperatures determined by CELs. We discuss the implications for abundances
determined via the analysis of CELs and RLs and provide a simple analytical
procedure to obtain upwards corrections for CEL-determined abundance. While we
show that the abundance discrepancy factor (ADF) and the Balmer Jump
temperature determined from observations of the Orion Nebula can simultaneously
be reproduced by this model (implying upward corrections for CELs by a factor
of 1.15), we find that the required X-ray fluxes exceed the known Orion's

given recent results suggesting that GRBs occur in low metallicity
environments. By utilizing measurements of the redshift evolution of the
mass-metallicity (M-Z) relationship for galaxies, along with a sharp host
metallicity cut-off suggested by Modjaz and collaborators, we estimate an upper
limit on the stellar mass of a galaxy that can efficiently produce a GRB as a
function of redshift. By employing consistent abundance indicators, we find
that sub-solar metallicity cut-offs effectively limit GRBs to low stellar mass
spirals and dwarf galaxies at low redshift. At higher redshifts, as the average
metallicity of galaxies in the Universe falls, the mass range of galaxies
capable of hosting a GRB broadens, with an upper bound approaching the mass of
even the largest spiral galaxies. We compare these predicted limits to the
growing number of published GRB host masses and find that extremely low
metallicity cut-offs of 0.1 to 0.5 solar are effectively ruled out by a large
number of intermediate mass galaxies at low redshift. A mass function that
includes a smooth decrease in the efficiency of producing GRBs in galaxies of
metallicity above 12+log(O/H)_(KK04) ~ 8.7 can, however, accommodate a majority
of the measured host galaxy masses. We find that at z ~ 1, the peak in the
observed GRB host mass distribution is inconsistent with the expected peak in
the mass of galaxies harboring most of the star formation. This suggests that
GRBs are metallicity biased tracers of star formation at low and intermediate
redshifts, although our model predicts that this bias should disappear at
higher redshifts due to the evolving metallicity content of the universe.

first phase lasts from the initial encounter until approximately coalescence.
It is characterized by homogeneous mid-IR spectral shapes, and IR emission
mainly from star formation, with a contribution from an AGN in some cases. At
the end of this phase, a ULIRG enters one of two evolutionary paths depending
on the dynamics of the merger, the available quantities of gas, and the masses
of the black holes in the progenitors. On one branch, the contributions from
the starburst and the AGN to the total IR luminosity decline and increase
respectively. The IR spectral shapes are heterogeneous, likely due to feedback
from AGN-driven winds. Some objects go through a brief QSO phase at the end. On
the other branch, the decline of the starburst relative to the AGN is less
pronounced, and few or no objects go through a QSO phase. We show that the 11.2
micron PAH feature is a remarkably good diagnostic of evolutionary phase, and
identify six ULIRGs that may be archetypes of key stages in this lifecycle.

theorems of Bollob\'as, Frankl, F\""uredi, Keevash, Pikhurko, Simonovits, and
Sudakov who proved that there is one copy of $F$.
  A sample result is the following: F\""uredi-Simonovits and independently
Keevash-Sudakov settled an old conjecture of S\'os by proving that the maximum
number of triples in an $n$ vertex triple system (for $n$ sufficiently large
and even) that contains no copy of the Fano plane is $p(n)={n/2 \choose 2}n.$
  We prove that there is an absolute constant $c$ such that if $n$ is
sufficiently large and $1 \le q \le cn^2$, then every $n$ vertex triple system
with $p(n)+q$ edges contains at least $6q({n/2 \choose 4}+(n/2 -3){n/2 \choose
3}$$ copies of the Fano plane. This is sharp for $q\le n/2-2$.
  Our proofs use the recently proved hypergraph removal lemma and stability
results for the corresponding Tur\'an problem.

more than 100 times deeper than 2MASS. The Synoptic All-Sky Infrared (SASIR)
Survey will reveal the missing sample of faint red dwarf stars in the local
solar neighborhood, and the unprecedented sensitivity over such a wide field
will result in the discovery of thousands of z ~ 7 quasars (and reaching to z >
10), allowing detailed study (in concert with JWST and Giant Segmented Mirror
Telescopes) of the timing and the origin(s) of reionization. As a time-domain
survey, SASIR will reveal the dynamic infrared universe, opening new phase
space for discovery. Synoptic observations of over 10^6 supernovae and variable
stars will provide better distance measures than optical studies alone. SASIR
also provides significant synergy with other major Astro2010 facilities,
improving the overall scientific return of community investments. Compared to
optical-only measurements, IR colors vastly improve photometric redshifts to z
~ 4, enhancing dark energy and dark matter surveys based on weak lensing and
baryon oscillations. The wide field and ToO capabilities will enable a
connection of the gravitational wave and neutrino universe - with events
otherwise poorly localized on the sky - to transient electromagnetic phenomena.

We find 90 cluster members with MIPS detections within two virial radii of the

dominated by AGN and the rest dominated by star formation. We find that 43 of
the star forming are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs). The majority of
sources (81%) are spirals or irregulars. A large fraction (at least 25%) show
obvious signs of interactions. The MIPS -detected member galaxies have varied
spatial distributions as compared to the MIPS-undetected members with one of
the three clusters showing SF galaxies being preferentially located on the
cluster outskirts, while the other 2 clusters show no such trend. Both the AGN
fraction and the summed SFR of cluster galaxies increases from z=0 to 1, at a
rate that is a few times faster in clusters than over the same redshift range
in the field. Cluster environment does have an effect on the evolution of both
AGN fraction and SFR from redshift one to the present, but does not effect the
infrared luminosities or morphologies of the MIPS sample. Star formation
happens in the same way regardless of environment making MIPS sources look the
same in the cluster and field, however the cluster environment does encourage a
more rapid evolution with time as compared to the field.

Stirpe et al. the optical bands vary simultaneously, with a delay of less than
1.5 days but both B and V bands lag the X-ray fluctuations by 3-9 days. This
delay points at optical variability produced by X-ray reprocessing and the
value of the lag places the reprocessor close to the broad line region. A power
spectrum analysis of the light curve, however, shows that the X-ray variability
has a power law shape bending to a steeper slope at a time-scale ~2.9 days
while the variability amplitude in the optical bands continues to grow towards
the longest time-scale covered, ~ 300 days. We show that the power spectra
together with the small value of the time delay is inconsistent with a picture
where all the optical variability is produced by X-ray reprocessing, though the
small amplitude, rapid optical fluctuations might be produced in this way. We
detect larger variability amplitudes on long time-scales in the optical bands
than in the X-rays. This behaviour adds to similar results recently obtained
for at least three other AGN and indicates a separate source of long term
optical variability, possibly accretion rate or thermal fluctuations in the
optically emitting accretion disc.

duration, average transmission rate, peak transmission rate, initiation time).
After careful consideration, a new definition of peak rate is required. Unlike
Sarvotham et al. [2005] who segmented sessions into two groups labelled alpha
and beta, we segment into 10 sessions according to the empirical quantiles of
the peak rate variable as a demonstration that the beta group is far from
homogeneous. Our more refined segmentation reveals additional structure that is
missed by segmentation into two groups. In each segment, we study the
dependence structure of (S, D, R) and find that it varies across the groups.
Furthermore, within each segment, session initiation times are well
approximated by a Poisson process whereas this property does not hold for the
data set taken as a whole. Therefore, we conclude that the peak rate level is
important for understanding structure and for constructing accurate simulations
of data in the wild. We outline a simple method of simulating network traffic

They are observed at heights of between 500 and 1500 pc, falling onto the
Galactic plane at velocities from 50 to 140 km s$^{-1}$. To explain the origin
of these clouds, we present a galactic fountain model, driven by the wind from
a super stellar cluster (SSC). We solve the equations for a steady, radiative
de Laval nozzle flow. We consider two effects not considered previously in
astrophysical nozzle flow models: cooling functions for different
metallicities, and the direct action of the galactic gravitational field on the
gas flowing along the nozzle. For an adiabatic nozzle flow, the gravity acting
directly on the gas within the nozzle ""stalls"" the nozzle flow for initial wind
velocities lower than the escape velocity from the Galaxy. For the same wind
velocity, a radiative nozzle flow stalls at lower altitudes above the galactic
plane. We find that SSC winds with velocities of $v_w=500 - 800$ km s$^{-1}$
produce nozzles stall at heights of $x_m=1 - 15$ kpc. The stalled nozzle flow
then rains back onto the galactic plane at velocities in the range observed in
intermediate and high velocity HI clouds. We study a nozzle flow driven by a
wind from a SSC close to the Galactic centre. We find that for velocities
within the range expected for a SSC wind, we can produce nozzle flows that
stall above the galactic plane. These stalled flows produce cool, infalling
clouds with velocities similar to those of intermediate and high velocity HI
clouds.

B$_{\bot}$ morphology is hourglass-like in the collapsing core near the
Ultracompact H II region e2 and also possibly in e8. The decrease in
polarization near the continuum peak seen at lower angular resolution is
apparently due to the more complex structures at smaller scales. In e2, the
pinched direction of the hourglass-like B field morphology is parallel to the
plane of the ionized accretion flow traced by H53$\alpha$, suggesting that the
massive stars are formed via processes similar to the low mass stars, i.e.
accretion through a disk, except that the mass involved is much larger.
Furthermore, our finding that the resolved collapsing cores in e2 and e8 lie

In this picture, signal and noise are clearly separated and identified in the

tower' (type II). For the models with weaker initial magnetic fields, the
magnetic tower stalls first and the subsequent MHD outflows are produced by
some eventual inflows of the accreting material from the equator to the polar
regions (type I). Regardless of type I or II, the jets can attain only mildly
relativistic speeds with the explosion energy less than $10^{49} \erg$, which
could possibly be related to the X-ray flashes. Due to high opacity for
neutrinos inside the disk, we find that the luminosities of $\nu_e$ and
$\bar{\nu}_e$ become almost comparable, which is advantageous for making the
energy deposition rate larger.

Simulation finite size effect, gold substrate thickness effect, temperature

coverage effect on thermal conductivity/conductance were studied. Vibration
power spectra of gold atoms in the substrate and sulfur atoms in the SAM were
calculated and vibration coupling of these two parts was analyzed. The
calculated thermal conductance values of Au-SAM-Au junctions are in the range

concluded that the Au-SAM interface resistance dominates thermal energy

the rapid development of the shielding fraction as well as its peculiar esponse
to ac and dc magnetic fields are explained by the formation of the Josephson

that OMAR response is observed in a device only when the corresponding active

with n vertices and p edges and its complementary graph G1 = (V, E1) with n
vertices and m = (((n*(n-1))/2)-p) edges can be implemented by Hadamard gates,
NOT gates, CNOT gates, CCNOT gates, Grover's operators, and quantum
measurements on a quantum computer. It is also demonstrated that if Grovers
algorithm is employed to accomplish the readout step in the DNA-based
algorithm, the quantum implementation of the DNA-based algorithm is equivalent
to the oracle work (in the language of Grover's algorithm), that is, the target
state labeling preceding Grover,s searching steps. It is shown that one oracle
work can be completed with O((2 * n) * (n + 1) * (n + 2) / 3) NOT gates, one
CNOT gate and O((4 * m) + (((2 * n) * (n + 1) * (n + 14)) / 6)) CCNOT gates.
This is to say that for the quantum implementation of the DNA-based algorithm
[Ho et al. 2005] a faster labeling of the target state is attained, which also
implies a speedy solution to an instance of the clique problem.

non-trivial state. Our approach consists in reducing the problem of classifying
topological insulators (superconductors) in d spatial dimensions to the problem
of Anderson localization at a (d-1) dimensional boundary of the system. We find
that in each spatial dimension there are precisely five distinct classes of
topological insulators (superconductors). The different topological sectors
within a given topological insulator (superconductor) can be labeled by an
integer winding number or a Z_2 quantity. One of the five topological
insulators is the 'quantum spin Hall' (or: Z_2 topological) insulator in d=2,
and its generalization in d=3 dimensions. For each dimension d, the five
topological insulators correspond to a certain subset of five of the ten
generic symmetry classes of Hamiltonians introduced more than a decade ago by
Altland and Zirnbauer in the context of disordered systems (which generalizes
the three well known ""Wigner-Dyson'' symmetry classes).

changes into the continuous one at zero temperature. Under magnetic fields,
ferromagnetic quantum critical fluctuations develop around the
antiferromagnetic QTCP in addition to antiferromagnetic ones, which is in sharp
contrast with the conventional antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. For
itinerant electron systems,} we show that the temperature dependence of
critical magnetic fluctuations around the QTCP are given as chiQ \propto
T^{-3/2} (chi0\propto T^{-3/4}) at the antiferromagnetic ordering
(ferromagnetic) wave number q=Q (q=0). The convex temperature dependence of
chi0^{-1} is the characteristic feature of the QTCP, which is never seen in the
conventional spin fluctuation theory. We propose that the general theory of
quantum tricriticality that has nothing to do with the specific Kondo physics
itself, solves puzzles of quantum criticalities widely observed in
heavy-fermion systems such as YbRh2Si2, CeRu2Si2, and beta-YbAlB4. For
YbRh2Si2, our theory successfully reproduces quantitative behaviors of the
experimental ferromagnetic susceptibility and the magnetization curve by
choosing the phenomenological parameters properly. The quantum tricriticality
is also consistent with singularities of other physical properties such as
specific heat, nuclear magnetic relaxation time 1/T_1T, and Hall coefficient.
For CeRu2Si2 and beta-YbAlB4, we point out that the quantum tricriticality is a

neutralinos. We find that the supersymmetric branching ratios are strongly

Distributional Borel Sum appears to be the most well suited tool to give

investigation is made in one and in three space dimensions with a central

using the Pad\'e approximants for calculating the distributional Borel
transform. A complete agreement is found with previous non-perturbative results
obtained by the numerical solution of the singular boundary value problem and

generator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path

matrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying
a new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us
to evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock

nodes, to facilitate communication between a source and destination.
Previously, distributed space-time codes were proposed to maximize the
achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, however, they fail to achieve all
the points of the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. In the presence of a
low-rate feedback link from the destination to each relay stage and the source,
this paper proposes an end-to-end antenna selection (EEAS) strategy as an
alternative to distributed space-time codes. The EEAS strategy uses a subset of
antennas of each relay stage for transmission of the source signal to the
destination with amplify and forwarding at each relay stage. The subsets are
chosen such that they maximize the end-to-end mutual information at the
destination. The EEAS strategy achieves the corner points of the optimal
diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (corresponding to maximum diversity gain and
maximum multiplexing gain) and achieves better diversity gain at intermediate
values of multiplexing gain, versus the best known distributed space-time
coding strategies. A distributed compress and forward (CF) strategy is also
proposed to achieve all points of the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff

the observed radio luminosities, sizes and durations of AGN jets. For Lorentz
factors of order 100 and magnetic fields of a few hundred $\mu G$, synchrotron

method comprising numerical simulations of water movement in soil and
forward-inverse modeling of ERT surveys for two synthetic data sets is
presented. Resistivity contrast, e.g. by changing water content, is shown to
have large influence on the resistivity quantification.
  An ensemble and clustering approach is introduced in which ensembles of 50
different inversion models for one data set are created by randomly varying the
parameters for a regularisation based inversion routine. The ensemble members
are sorted into five clusters of similar models and the mean model for each
cluster is computed. Distinguishing persisting features in the mean models from
singular artifacts in individual tomograms can improve the interpretation of
inversion results.
  Especially in the presence of large resistivity contrasts in high sensitivity
areas, the quantification of resistivities can be unreliable. The ensemble
approach shows that this is an inherent problem present for all models inverted
with the regularisation based routine. The results also suggest that the
combination of hydrological and electrical modeling might lead to better
results.

typings for $\lambda$-terms in type systems with intersection types. Expansion
variables (E-variables) were invented at the end of the 1990s to simplify and
help mechanise expansion. Recently, E-variables have been further simplified
and generalised to also allow calculating type operators other than just
intersection. There has been much work on denotational semantics for type
systems with intersection types, but none whatsoever before now on type systems
with E-variables. Building a semantics for E-variables turns out to be
challenging. To simplify the problem, we consider only E-variables, and not the
corresponding operation of expansion. We develop a realisability semantics
where each use of an E-variable in a type corresponds to an independent degree
at which evaluation occurs in the $\lambda$-term that is assigned the type. In
the $\lambda$-term being evaluated, the only interaction possible between
portions at different degrees is that higher degree portions can be passed
around but never applied to lower degree portions. We apply this semantics to

completeness does not hold for the first system, and completeness holds for the
second system when only one E-variable is allowed (although it can be used many
times and nested). As far as we know, this is the first study of a denotational
semantics of intersection type systems with E-variables (using realisability or

the Padova theoretical isochrones to the observational CMDs. Age distribution
of the star clusters shows a dominant peak at log(t) ~ 7.8. Majority of star
clusters are younger than log(t) = 9.0, while ten star clusters are older than
log(t) ~ 9.0. There are few clusters younger than log(t) = 7 in this study,
which is in contrast with the results based on the integrated photometry of
star clusters in the previous studies. Radial distribution of the cluster ages
shows that young to intermediate-age clusters are found from the center to the
outer region, while old clusters are distributed farther from M33 center. We
discuss briefly the implication of the results with regard to the formation of

visual cortex uses parts-based representations to encode, store and retrieve
relevant objects. In such a scheme, objects are represented as a set of
spatially distributed local features, or parts, arranged in stereotypical
fashion. To encode the local appearance and to represent the relations between
the constituent parts, there has to be an appropriate memory structure formed
by previous experience with visual objects. Here, we propose a model how a
hierarchical memory structure supporting efficient storage and rapid recall of
parts-based representations can be established by an experience-driven process
of self-organization. The process is based on the collaboration of slow
bidirectional synaptic plasticity and homeostatic unit activity regulation,
both running at the top of fast activity dynamics with winner-take-all
character modulated by an oscillatory rhythm. These neural mechanisms lay down
the basis for cooperation and competition between the distributed units and
their synaptic connections. Choosing human face recognition as a test task, we
show that, under the condition of open-ended, unsupervised incremental
learning, the system is able to form memory traces for individual faces in a
parts-based fashion. On a lower memory layer the synaptic structure is
developed to represent local facial features and their interrelations, while
the identities of different persons are captured explicitly on a higher layer.
An additional property of the resulting representations is the sparseness of
both the activity during the recall and the synaptic patterns comprising the
memory traces.

are being developed. At the SPIRAL facility in GANIL a neutron detector array,
the Neutron Wall, is located. In this work the Neutron Wall has been
characterized regarding neutron detection efficiency and discrimination between

increasing the high voltage of the photomultiplier tubes has also been studied.
For SPIRAL2 a neutron detector array, NEDA, is being developed. NEDA will
operate in a high gamma-ray background environment which puts a high demand on
the quality of discrimination between neutrons and gamma rays. To increase the
quality of the discrimination methods pulse-shape discrimination techniques
utilizing digital electronics have been developed and evaluated regarding bit
resolution and sampling frequency of the ADC. The conclusion is that an ADC
with a bit resolution of 12 bits and a sampling frequency of 100 MS/s is
adequate for pulse-shape discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays for a
neutron energy range of 0.3-12 MeV.
