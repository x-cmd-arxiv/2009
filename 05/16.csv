Local Universe to predict the radio halo and the gamma-ray flux from the Coma
cluster and compare it to current observations. The simulated magnetic field
within the Coma cluster is the result of turbulent amplification of the
magnetic field during build-up of the cluster. The magnetic seed field
originates from star-burst driven, galactic outflows. The synchrotron emission
is calculated assuming a hadronic model. We follow four approaches with
different distributions for the cosmic-ray proton (CRp) population within
galaxy clusters. The radial profile the radio halo can only be reproduced with
a radially increasing energy fraction within the cosmic ray proton population,
reaching $>$100% of the thermal energy content at $\approx$ 1Mpc, e.g. the edge
of the radio emitting region. Additionally the spectral steepening of the
observed radio halo in Coma cannot be reproduced, even when accounting for the
negative flux from the thermal SZ effect at high frequencies. Therefore the
hadronic models are disfavored from present analysis. The emission of
$\gamma$-rays expected from our simulated coma is still below the current
observational limits (by a factor of $\sim$6) but would be detectable in the
near future.

notably show that the motion of massive bodies may be changed even if one
assumes that matter is minimally coupled to the metric as in GR. This is
illustrated with the particular case of scalar-tensor theories of gravity,
whose Fokker action is discussed, and we also mention the consequences of the
no-hair theorem on the motion of black holes. The finite size of the bodies
modifies their motion with respect to pointlike particles, and we give a simple
argument showing that the corresponding effects are generically much larger in
alternative theories than in GR. We also discuss possible modifications of
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) at large distances, which have been proposed to avoid
the dark matter hypothesis. We underline that all the previous classes of
alternatives to GR may a priori be used to predict such a phenomenology, but
that they generically involve several theoretical and experimental
difficulties.

suffers from two different strong coupling problems, extending all the way into
the deep infra-red. The first of these is associated with the principle of
detailed balance and explains why solutions to General Relativity are typically
not recovered in models that preserve this structure. The second of these
occurs even without detailed balance and is associated with the breaking of
diffeomorphism invariance, required for anisotropic scaling in the UV. Since
there is a reduced symmetry group there are additional degrees of freedom,
which need not decouple in the infra-red. Indeed, we use the Stuckelberg trick
to show that one of these extra modes become strongly coupled as the parameters
approach their desired infra-red fixed point. Whilst we can evade the first
strong coupling problem by breaking detailed balance, we cannot avoid the
second, whatever the form of the potential. Therefore the original Horava
model, and its ""phenomenologically viable"" extensions do not have a
perturbative General Relativity limit at any scale. Experiments which confirm
the perturbative gravitational wave prediction of General Relativity, such as
the cumulative shift of the periastron time of binary pulsars, will presumably
rule out the theory.

manifestations of CMEs. The EUV imager/white light coronagraph connection has
been proven so powerful, it is routinely assumed that if no EUV signatures are
present when a CME is observed by a coronagraph, then the event must originate
behind the visible limb. This assumption carries strong implications for space
weather forecasting but has not been put to the test. This paper presents the
first detailed analysis of a frontside, large-scale CME that has no obvious
counterparts in the low corona. The event was observed by the SECCHI
instruments. The COR2A coronagraph observed a slow flux-rope type CME, while an
extremely faint partial halo was observed in COR2B. The event evolved very
slowly and is typical of the streamer-blowout CME class. EUVI A 171 images show
a concave feature above the east limb, relatively stable for about two days
before the eruption, when it rises into the coronagraphic fields and develops
into the core of the CME. None of the typical low corona signatures of a CME
were observed in the EUVI-B images, which we attribute to the unusually large
height from which the flux-rope lifted off. This interpretation is supported by
the CME mass measurements and estimates of the expected EUV dimming intensity.
Only thanks to the availability of the two viewpoints we were able to identify
the likely source region. The event originated along a neutral line over the
quiet sun. No active regions were present anywhere on the visible (from STEREO
B) face of the disk. Leaving no trace behind on the solar disk, this
observation shows unambiguously that a CME eruption does not need to have clear
on-disk signatures.

realm of conformity is confined within the virialized region associated with
each galaxy plus dark matter halo system. When a galaxy is located within the
virial radius of its nearest neighbor galaxy, its morphology strongly depends
on the neighbor's distance and morphology: the probability for a galaxy to be
an early type ($f_E$) strongly increases as it approaches an early-type
neighbor, but tends to decrease as it approaches a late-type neighbor. We find
that $f_E$ evolves much faster in high density regions than in low density
regions, and that the morphology-density relation becomes significantly weaker
at $z\approx 1$. This may be because the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions is
higher in high density regions, and a series of interactions and mergers over
the course of galaxy life eventually transform late types into early types. We
find more isolated galaxies are more luminous, which supports luminosity
transformation through mergers at these redshifts. Our results are consistent
with those from nearby galaxies, and demonstrate that galaxy-galaxy
interactions have been strongly affecting the galaxy evolution over a long

fractal aggregates have on the growth of dust grains. Aggregates in a plasma or
radiative environment will have charge distributed over their extended surface,
which leads to a net dipole moment for the charged grains. A self-consistent
N-body code is used to model the dynamics of interacting charged aggregates.
The aggregates are free to rotate due to collisions and dipole-dipole
electrostatic interactions. These rotations are important in determining the
growth rate and subsequent geometry (fractal dimension) of the grains. In
contrast to previous studies which have only taken charge-dipole interactions
into account, like-charged grains are found to coagulate more efficiently than
neutral grains due to preferential incorporation of small aggregates into
mid-sized aggregate structures. The charged aggregates tend to be more compact
than neutral aggregates, characterized by slightly higher fractal dimensions.

considered on cosmological scales. Out of the four components of the
electromagnetic field, Maxwell's theory only contains two physical degrees of
freedom. However, in the presence of gravity, one of the ""unphysical"" states
cannot be consistently eliminated, thus becoming real. This third polarization
state is completely decoupled from charged matter, but can be excited
gravitationally thus breaking gauge invariance. On large scales the new state
can be seen as a homogeneous cosmic electric potential, whose energy density
behaves as a cosmological constant.

to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden
Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006)

data---creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them---we describe
an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate.
We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission
distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to
realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a
truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full
state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST
data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields
state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.

Protoplanetary disc turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability has
a huge influence on the early stages of planet formation. Small dust grains are
transported both vertically and radially in the disc by turbulent diffusion,
counteracting sedimentation to the mid-plane and transporting crystalline
material from the hot inner disc to the outer parts. The conclusion from recent
efforts to measure the turbulent diffusion coefficient of magnetorotational
turbulence is that turbulent diffusion of small particles is much stronger than
naively thought. Larger particles -- pebbles, rocks and boulders -- get trapped
in long-lived high pressure regions that arise spontaneously at large scales in
the turbulent flow. These gas high pressures, in geostrophic balance with a
sub-Keplerian/super-Keplerian zonal flow envelope, are excited by radial
fluctuations in the Maxwell stress. The coherence time of the Maxwell stress is
only a few orbits, where as the correlation time of the pressure bumps is
comparable to the turbulent mixing time-scale, many tens or orbits on scales
much greater than one scale height. The particle overdensities contract under
the combined gravity of all the particles and condense into gravitationally
bound clusters of rocks and boulders. These planetesimals have masses
comparable to the dwarf planet Ceres. I conclude with thoughts on future
priorities in the field of planet formation in turbulent discs.

model. Spin-disorder resistivity is found to depend weakly on magnetic
short-range order. If the local moments are kept frozen at their
zero-temperature values, very good agreement with experiment is obtained for
Fe, but for Ni the resistivity at elevated temperatures is significantly
overestimated. Agreement with experiment for Fe is improved if the local
moments are iterated to self-consistency. The overestimation of the resistivity
for paramagnetic Ni is attributed to the reduction of the local moments down to
0.35 Bohr magnetons. Overall, the results suggest that low-energy spin

small scales using a cosmological simulation of a (50 Mpc/h)^3 volume of the
universe. The MareNostrum simulation was performed using the AMR code RAMSES,
and includes most of the physical ingredients which are part of the current
theory of galaxy formation, such as metal-dependent cooling and UV heating,
subgrid modelling of the ISM, star formation and supernova feedback. We re-ran
the same initial conditions for a dark matter only universe, as a reference
point for baryon-free cosmic statistics. In this paper, we present the measured
small-scale amplification of sigma^2 and S_3 due to baryonic physics and their
interpretation in the framework of the halo model. As shown in recent studies,
the effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum can be accounted for at
scales k <~ 10 h/Mpc by modifying the halo concentration parameter. We propose
to extend this result by using a halo profile which is a linear combination of
a NFW profile for the dark matter and an exponential disk profile mimicking the
baryonic component at the heart of the halo. This halo profile form is
physically motivated, and depends on two parameters, the mass fraction f_d of
baryons in the disk, and the ratio lambda_d of the disk's characteristic scale
to the halo's virial radius. We find this composite profile to reproduce both
the small-scale variance and skewness boosts measured in the simulation up to k
~ 10^2 h/Mpc for physically meaningful values of the parameters f_d and
lambda_d. Although simulations like the one presented here usually suffer from
various problems when compared to observations, our modified halo model could
be used as a fitting model to improve the determination of cosmological
parameters from weak lensing convergence spectra and skewness measurements.

show how the scale-invariance of the perturbation spectrum arises. We also
examine the spectrum of scalar perturbations of the metric that are created by
the inflaton fluctuations that have left the Hubble sphere during inflation and
the spectrum of density perturbations that they produce at reentry after
inflation has ended. When the inflaton dispersion spectrum is renormalized
during the expansion, we show (for the case of the quadratic inflaton
potential) that the density perturbation spectrum approaches a mass-independent
limit as the inflaton mass approaches zero, and remains near that limiting
value for masses less than about 1/4 of the inflationary Hubble constant. We
show that this limiting behavior does not occur if one only makes the Minkowski
space subtraction, without the further adiabatic subtractions that involve time
derivatives of the expansion scale factor $a(t)$. We also find a parametrized
expression for the energy density produced by the change in $a(t)$ as inflation
ends. If the end of inflation were sufficiently abrupt, then the temperature
corresponding to this energy density could be very significant. We also show
that fluctuations of the inflaton field that are present before inflation
starts are not dissipated during inflation, and could have a significant
observational effect today. The mechanism for this is caused by the initial
fluctuations through stimulated emission from the vacuum.

Multiple factors, including an unknown non-rigid spatial transformation, large
dimensionality of point set, noise and outliers, make the point set
registration a challenging problem. We introduce a probabilistic method, called
the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) algorithm, for both rigid and non-rigid point
set registration. We consider the alignment of two point sets as a probability
density estimation problem. We fit the GMM centroids (representing the first
point set) to the data (the second point set) by maximizing the likelihood. We
force the GMM centroids to move coherently as a group to preserve the
topological structure of the point sets. In the rigid case, we impose the
coherence constraint by re-parametrization of GMM centroid locations with rigid
parameters and derive a closed form solution of the maximization step of the EM
algorithm in arbitrary dimensions. In the non-rigid case, we impose the
coherence constraint by regularizing the displacement field and using the
variational calculus to derive the optimal transformation. We also introduce a
fast algorithm that reduces the method computation complexity to linear. We
test the CPD algorithm for both rigid and non-rigid transformations in the

classified into mesh-based interpolation methods, and hierarchical or
multiresolution methods. To this last class belongs the well-known fast
multipole method (FMM), which offers O(N) complexity. This paper presents an
extensible parallel library for $N$-body interactions utilizing the FMM
algorithm, built on the framework of PETSc. A prominent feature of this library
is that it is designed to be extensible, with a view to unifying efforts
involving many algorithms based on the same principles as the FMM and enabling
easy development of scientific application codes. The paper also details an
exhaustive model for the computation of tree-based $N$-body algorithms in
parallel, including both work estimates and communications estimates. With this
model, we are able to implement a method to provide automatic, a priori load
balancing of the parallel execution, achieving optimal distribution of the
computational work among processors and minimal inter-processor communications.
Using a client application that performs the calculation of velocity induced by
$N$ vortex particles, ample verification and testing of the library was
performed. Strong scaling results are presented with close to a million
particles in up to 64 processors, including both speedup and parallel
efficiency. The library is currently able to achieve over 85% parallel
efficiency for 64 processors. The software library is open source under the
PETSc license; this guarantees the maximum impact to the scientific community
and encourages peer-based collaboration for the extensions and applications.

networks is shown to yield a significant performance improvement. However,
there exists an inherent trade off between the gains in terms of probability of
detection of the primary user (PU) and the costs in terms of false alarm
probability. In this paper, we study the impact of this trade off on the
topology and the dynamics of a network of SUs seeking to reduce the
interference on the PU through collaborative sensing. Moreover, while existing
literature mainly focused on centralized solutions for collaborative sensing,
we propose distributed collaboration strategies through game theory. We model
the problem as a non-transferable coalitional game, and propose a distributed
algorithm for coalition formation through simple merge and split rules. Through
the proposed algorithm, SUs can autonomously collaborate and self-organize into
disjoint independent coalitions, while maximizing their detection probability
taking into account the cooperation costs (in terms of false alarm). We study
the stability of the resulting network structure, and show that a maximum
number of SUs per formed coalition exists for the proposed utility model.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm allows a reduction of up to
86.6% of the average missing probability per SU (probability of missing the
detection of the PU) relative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a
certain false alarm level. In addition, through simulations, we compare the
performance of the proposed distributed solution with respect to an optimal
centralized solution that minimizes the average missing probability per SU.
Finally, the results also show how the proposed algorithm autonomously adapts
the network topology to environmental changes such as mobility.

range at which the Cosmic Background Imager experiment operated. An efficient
way to achieve this challenging goal has been to compute the high frequency
flux density of those sources by extrapolating their radio spectrum. This is
determined by the three-point spectral index measured on the basis of the NVSS
entry at 1.4 GHz and the measurements at 4.85 GHz and 10.45 GHz carried out
with the 100 m Effelsberg telescope. These measurements are important since the
targeted sample probes the weak part of the flux density distribution, hence
the decision to make the data available. We present the table with flux density
measurements of 3434 sources that showed no confusion allowing reliable
measurements, their detection rates, their spectral index distribution and an
interpretation which explains satisfactorily the observed uncertainties.

is equivalent to the optimization of Newman's modularity on the maximal clique

partitioning the maximal clique network using any modularity optimization

access channels (MACs) when the number of accessible dimensions per transmitter
is strategically limited. Considering each dimension as a frequency band, we
call this limiting process bandwidth limiting (BL). Assuming that each
transmitter maximizes its own data rate by water-filling over the available
frequency bands, we consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, transmitters
use non-intersecting sets of bands (spectral resource partition), and in the
second one, they freely exploit all the available frequency bands (spectral
resource sharing). In the latter case, successive interference cancelation
(SIC) is used. We show the existence of an optimal number of dimensions that a
transmitter must use in order to maximize the network performance measured in
terms of spectral efficiency. We provide a closed form expression for the
optimal number of accessible bands in the first scenario. Such an optimum
point, depends on the number of active transmitters, the number of available
frequency bands and the different signal-to-noise ratios. In the second
scenario, we show that BL does not bring a significant improvement on the
network spectral efficiency, when all transmitters use the same BL policy. For
both scenarios, we provide simulation results to validate our conclusions.

SNIa$+R+A+d$, SNIa$+R+A+d+H(z)$, and WMAP5+2dF+SNLS+HST+BBN, the $\Lambda$CDM
model can only accommodate $T(z=3.91)=1.7$ Gyr at 1 $\sigma$ deviation.
Constrained from WMAP5 results only, the $\Lambda$CDM model can only
accommodate $T(z=3.91)=1.7$ Gyr at 2 $\sigma$ deviation. In all these cases, we
found that $\Lambda$CDM model accommodates the total age (14 Gyr for $z=0$) of
the Universe estimated from old globular clusters, but cannot accommodate
statistically the 1 $\sigma$ lower limit to the best-fit age of APM~08279+5255
at $z=3.91$. These results imply that the $\Lambda$CDM model may suffer from an
age problem.

magneto-optical (MO) imaging and radio-frequency (rf) magnetic susceptibility,
$\chi$. Real time MO images reveal unusual, slow dynamics of dendritic domain
formation, the details of which are strongly dependent upon magnetic and
thermal history. Measurements of $\chi(T)$ show well-defined, local moment
ferromagnetic transition at $T\approx 155$ K as well as thermal hysteresis for
50 K$<T<$60 K. This temperature range corresponds to the domain formation
temperature as determined by MO. Together these observations provide strong
evidence for local moment ferromagnetism in Fe$_{1/4}$TaS$_{2}$ crystals with
large, temperature dependent magnetic anisotropy.

coupled to a gate electrode and to a massive reservoir via single tunneling
junction. The dissipation of energy is caused by a slowly oscillating gate
voltage. We compute it in the regimes of weak and strong Coulomb blockade. We
focus on the regime of not very low temperatures when electron coherence can be
neglected but quantum fluctuations of charge are strong due to Coulomb
interaction. The answers assume a particularly transparent form while expressed
in terms of specially chosen physical observables. We discovered that the
dissipation rate is given by a universal expression in both limiting cases.
