candidates in theories with a strongly interacting hidden sector at a scale of
10 - 100 TeV. Light axion-like states, with masses in the 1 MeV - 10 GeV range,
are also generic, and can decay via Higgs couplings to light standard model
particles. Such a scenario is well motivated in the context of very low energy
supersymmetry breaking, where ubiquitous cosmological problems associated with
the gravitino are avoided. We investigate the astrophysical and collider
signatures of this scenario, assuming that dark matter decays into the
axion-like states via dimension six operators, and we present an illustrative
model exhibiting these features. We conclude that the recent data from PAMELA,
FERMI, and H.E.S.S. points to this setup as a compelling paradigm for dark
matter. This has important implications for future diffuse gamma ray
measurements and collider searches.

objects and their properties are constructed from fundamental objects called ur
objects being described by an element of a two dimensional complex Hilbert
space. This approach is based on the assumption that quantum theory represents
a theory being constitutive for human knowledge. Physical objects are
characterized by the information one can gain from them being contained in the
quantum state they are described by. Since every Hilbert space can be
represented as a tensor product of two dimensional Hilbert spaces, one is led
to the ur objects. According to this approach relativistic quantum fields and
thus the existence of a Minkowski space-time are the consequence of an
iteration of a quantization of binary alternatives. In the original formulation
there was only obtained a description of quantum fields on a flat Minkowski
space-time. In this work there is made the attempt to incorporate general
relativity and to describe the gravitational field within this approach. Thus
the existence of a (3+1)-dimensional space-time in the sense of general
relativity is assumed to be a consequence of quantum theory interpreted in an
abstract sense.

planets for SPICA, in which a coronagraph is currently regarded as an option of
the focal plane instruments. The primary target of the SPICA coronagraph is the
direct observation of Jovian exo-planets. A strategy of the baseline survey and
the specifications for the coronagraph instrument for the survey are introduced
together. The main wavelengths and the contrast required for the observations
are 3.5-27um, and 10^{-6}, respectively.Laboratory experiments were performed
with a visible laser to demonstrate the principles of the coronagraphs. In an
experiment using binary-shaped pupil coronagraphs, a contrast of 6.7x10^{-8}
was achieved, as derived from the linear average in the dark region and the
core of the PSF. A coronagraph by a binary-shaped pupil mask is a baseline
solution for SPICA because of its feasibility and robustness. On the other
hand, a laboratory experiment of the phase induced amplitude
apodization/binary-mask hybrid coronagraph has been executed to obtain an
option of higher performance, and a contrast of 6.5x10^{-7} was achieved with
active wavefront control.Potentially important by-product of the instrument,
transit monitoring for characteization of exo-planets, is also described. We
also present recent progress of technology on a design of a binary-shaped pupil
mask for the actual pupil of SPICA, PSF subtraction, the development of
free-standing binary masks, a vacuum chamber, and a cryogenic deformable
mirror. Considering SPICA to be an essential platform for coronagraphs and the
progress of key technologies, we propose to develop a mid-infrared coronagraph
instrument for SPICA and to perform the direct observation of exo-planets with
it.

means are commonly desired in high energy physics (HEP) applications such as
measuring a detection efficiency or branching ratio. Due to the discreteness of
the data, in both of these problems the frequentist coverage probability
unfortunately depends on the unknown parameter. Trade-offs among desiderata
have led to numerous sets of intervals in the statistics literature, while in
HEP one typically encounters only the classic intervals of Clopper-Pearson
(central intervals with no undercoverage but substantial over-coverage) or a
few approximate methods which perform rather poorly. If strict coverage is
relaxed, some sort of averaging is needed to compare intervals. In most of the
statistics literature, this averaging is over different values of the unknown
parameter, which is conceptually problematic from the frequentist point of view
in which the unknown parameter is typically fixed. In contrast, we perform an
(unconditional) {\it average over observed data} in the ratio-of-Poisson-means
problem. If strict conditional coverage is desired, we recommend
Clopper-Pearson intervals and intervals from inverting the likelihood ratio
test (for central and non-central intervals, respectively). Lancaster's mid-$P$
modification to either provides excellent unconditional average coverage in the
ratio-of-Poisson-means problem.

counterterms' -- in the action. The variation of the action with respect to the
boundary metric yields a boundary stress tensor, which is used to construct
conserved charges that generate the asymptotic symmetries of the theory. In
most cases a minimal set of assumptions leads to a unique set of counterterms.
However, for certain examples we find families of actions that depend on one or
more continuous parameters. We show that the conserved charges and the value of
the on-shell action are always independent of these parameters.

constructing a simple flooding scheme that requires no information at the

such conditional probabilities that is well behaved for spatially large or
infinite universes when the probabilities that our data is replicated are taken
into account. In histories where our data are rare volume weighting connects
top-down probabilities conditioned on both the data and the quantum state to
the bottom-up probabilities conditioned on the quantum state alone. We apply
these principles to a calculation of the number of inflationary e-folds in a
homogeneous, isotropic minisuperspace model with a single scalar field moving

cellular level of neurons, as a result of their mutual interactions, leads to
the observed behavior of an organism responding to a variety of environmental
stimuli. Investigating the intermediate or mesoscopic level of organization in
the nervous system is a vital step towards understanding how the integration of
micro-level dynamics results in macro-level functioning. In this paper, we have
considered the somatic nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans,
for which the entire neuronal connectivity diagram is known. We focus on the
organization of the system into modules, i.e., neuronal groups having
relatively higher connection density compared to that of the overall network.
We show that this mesoscopic feature cannot be explained exclusively in terms
of considerations, such as optimizing for resource constraints (viz., total
wiring cost) and communication efficiency (i.e., network path length).
Comparison with other complex networks designed for efficient transport (of
signals or resources) implies that neuronal networks form a distinct class.
This suggests that the principal function of the network, viz., processing of
sensory information resulting in appropriate motor response, may be playing a
vital role in determining the connection topology. Using modular spectral
analysis, we make explicit the intimate relation between function and structure
in the nervous system. This is further brought out by identifying functionally
critical neurons purely on the basis of patterns of intra- and inter-modular
connections. Our study reveals how the design of the nervous system reflects
several constraints, including its key functional role as a processor of
information.

source in detail. The spectrum was taken on 2001 February 1, when the source
was in a bright state and showed broad, double-peaked hydrogen and helium lines
-- dramatically different from the G-type absorption spectrum seen from 2003
onward. The lines are consistent with emission from a disk around the compact
primary. We derive properties of the disk by fitting the SDSS continuum with a
simple disk model, and find a temperature range of 2000--34000 K from the outer
to inner edge of the disk. The disk inner and outer radii were approximately
10^9 and 5.7x10^10 cm, respectively. These results further emphasize the unique
feature of the source: it is likely a system at the end of its transition from
an X-ray binary to a recycled radio pulsar. The disk mass is estimated to have
been ~10^23 g, most of which would have been lost due to pulsar wind ablation
(or due to the propeller effect if the disk had extended inside the light
cylinder of the pulsar) before the final disk disruption event. The system
could undergo repeated episodes of disk formation. Close monitoring of the
source is needed to catch the system in its bright state again, so that this

dependent orbifold singularity. The dynamics of a membrane, with the parameters
space topology of a torus, winding uniformly around compact dimension of the
embedding spacetime is mathematically equivalent to the dynamics of a closed
string in a flat FRW spacetime. The construction of the physical Hilbert space
of a membrane makes use of the kernel space of self-adjoint constraint
operators. It is a subspace of the representation space of the constraints
algebra. There exist non-trivial quantum states of a membrane evolving across
the singularity.

show that the number of trajectories which exhibit excursions away from the
typical behaviour i.e., $W_{c}<0$, $W<\Delta F$ and dissipated heat $Q<0$
decreases as anticipated for macroscopic time scales. Analytical expressions
for such trajectories are obtained. Trajectory for which $W_{c}<0$ may not

result of the muon-spin rotation (\muSR) measurements of Mo_3Sb_7
superconductor. Based on the analysis of the temperature and the magnetic field
dependence of the Gaussian relaxation rate \sigma_{sc} they suggest that
Mo_3Sb_7 is the superconductor with two isotropic s-wave like gaps. An
additional confirmation was obtained from the specific heat data published
earlier by partly the same group of authors in [Acta Mater. 56, 5694 (2008)].
The purpose of this Comment is to point out that from the analysis made by Tran
et al. the presence of two superconducting energy gaps in Mo_3Sb_7 can not be
justified. The analysis of \muSR data does not account for the reduction of
\sigma_{sc} with increasing temperature, and, hence, yields inaccurate
information on the magnetic penetration depth. The specific heat data can be
satisfactory described within the framework of the one-gap model with the small
residual specific heat component. The experimental data of Tran et al., as well
as our earlier published \muSR data [Phys. Rev. B 78, 014502 (2008)] all seem
to be consistent with is the presence of single isotropic superconducting
energy gap in Mo_3Sb_7.

and thus for the origin of the three non-gravitational interactions is
presented. The argument is based on a proposal for the final theory that models
nature at Planck scales as a collection of featureless strands that fluctuate
in three dimensions. This approach models vacuum as untangled strands,
particles as tangles of strands, and Planck units as crossing switches.
  Modelling vacuum as untangled strands implies the field equations of general
relativity, when applying an argument from 1995 to the thermodynamics of such
strands. Modelling fermions as tangles of two or more strands allows to define
wave functions as time-averages of oriented strand crossing density. Using an
argument from 1980, this allows to deduce the Dirac equation.
  When fermions are modelled as tangled strands, gauge interactions appear
naturally as deformation of tangle cores. The three possible types of
observable core deformations are given by the three Reidemeister moves. They
naturally lead to a U(1), a broken and parity-violating SU(2), and a SU(3)
gauge group. The corresponding Lagrangians also appear naturally.
  The strand model is unique, is unmodifiable, is consistent with all known
data, and makes numerous testable predictions, including the absence of other
interactions, of grand unification, of supersymmetry and of higher dimensions.
A method for calculating coupling constants seems to appear naturally.

density-functional and density-functional perturbation theory within the

constants agree well with the experimental values. The elastic constants of

constants the shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, sound velocities

nature. The computed phonon-dispersion relation shows that both compounds are
dynamically stable in the L1$_2$ structure without any imaginary phonon
frequencies. The isomer shifts of Fe in the two compounds are discussed in
terms of the Fe s partial density of states, which reveal larger ionicity/less
hybridization in Fe$_2$VGa than in Fe$_2$VAl. For the same reason the Cauchy
pressure is negative in Fe$_2$VAl but positive in Fe$_2$VGa
