wave (SDW) order in a theory of the hole-doped cuprates at hole densities below
optimal doping. The theory assumes local SDW order, and associated electron and
hole pocket Fermi surfaces of charge carriers in the normal state. We describe
quantum and thermal fluctuations in the orientation of the local SDW order,
which lead to d-wave superconductivity: we compute the superconducting critical
temperature and magnetic field in a `minimal' universal theory. We also
describe the back-action of the superconductivity on the SDW order, showing
that SDW order is more stable in the metal. Our results capture key aspects of
the phase diagram of Demler et al. (cond-mat/0103192) obtained in a
phenomenological quantum theory of competing orders. Finally, we propose a
finite temperature crossover phase diagram for the cuprates. In the metallic
state, these are controlled by a `hidden' quantum critical point near optimal
doping involving the onset of SDW order in a metal. However, the onset of
superconductivity results in a decrease in stability of the SDW order, and
consequently the actual SDW quantum critical point appears at a significantly
lower doping.
  All our analysis is placed in the context of recent experimental results.

phenomenon is addressed by investigating the thermodynamic driving forces for
surface segregation using a local (inhomogeneous) cluster expansion fitted to

bulk and surface regions. Subsequent Monte Carlo simulations reveal that first
surface layer Pt segregation is compensated by Pt depletion in the second

gas dynamics and radiative transfer self-consistently is key to the solution of
many problems in numerical astrophysics. Such fluid flows are highly complex,
rarely allowing even for approximate analytical solutions against which
numerical codes can be tested. An alternative validation procedure is to
compare different methods against each other on common problems, in order to
assess the robustness of the results and establish a range of validity for the
methods. Previously, we presented such a comparison for a set of pure radiative
transfer tests (i.e. for fixed, non-evolving density fields). This is the
second paper of the Cosmological Radiative Transfer (RT) Comparison Project, in

H II region in a uniform medium; (6) an ionization front (I-front) in a 1/r^2
density profile with a flat core, and (7), the photoevaporation of a uniform
dense clump. Results show a broad agreement between the different methods and
no big failures, indicating that the participating codes have reached a certain
level of maturity and reliability. However, many details still do differ, and
virtually every code has showed some shortcomings and has disagreed, in one
respect or another, with the majority of the results. This underscores the fact
that no method is universal and all require careful testing of the particular
features which are most relevant to the specific problem at hand.

face and possibly many other traits. This is because we possess the so-called
associative memory, that is the ability to correlate different memories to the
same fact or event. Associative memory is such a fundamental and encompassing
human ability (and not just human) that the network of neurons in our brain
must perform it quite easily. The question is then whether electronic neural
networks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can
be built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural
networks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses
between adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic
representation. The reason for this is that a passive circuit element able to
reproduce the synapse behaviour needs to remember its past dynamical history,
store a continuous set of states, and be ""plastic"" according to the
pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuronal activity. Here we show that all this
can be accomplished by a memory-resistor (memristor for short). In particular,
by using simple and inexpensive off-the-shelf components we have built a
memristor emulator which realizes all required synaptic properties. Most
importantly, we have demonstrated experimentally the formation of associative
memory in a simple neural network consisting of three electronic neurons
connected by two memristor-emulator synapses. This experimental demonstration
opens up new possibilities in the understanding of neural processes using
memory devices, an important step forward to reproduce complex learning,
adaptive and spontaneous behaviour with electronic neural networks.

in which it is no longer in contact with the floor. We show that when the
external force that created the ruck is removed, the ruck flattens out unless
the initial compression is greater than a critical value, which we determine.
We also study the inertial motion of a ruck that is generated when one end of
the rug is moved rapidly. We show that the equations of motion admit a
travelling ruck solution for which a linear combination of the tension and
kinetic energy is determined by the ruck size. We confirm these findings
experimentally. We end by discussing the potential implications of our work for
the analogous propagation of localized slip pulses in the sliding of two bodies
in contact.

describe PPML, a local stencil variant of the popular PPM algorithm for solving
the equations of compressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The principal
difference between PPML and PPM is that cell interface states are evolved
rather that reconstructed at every timestep, resulting in a compact stencil.
Interface states are evolved using Riemann invariants containing all transverse
derivative information. The conservation laws are updated in an unsplit
fashion, making the scheme fully multidimensional. Divergence-free evolution of
the magnetic field is maintained using the higher order-accurate constrained
transport technique of Gardiner and Stone. The accuracy and stability of the
scheme is documented against a bank of standard test problems drawn from the
literature. The method is applied to numerical simulation of supersonic MHD
turbulence, which is important for many problems in astrophysics, including
star formation in dark molecular clouds. PPML accurately reproduces in
three-dimensions a transition to turbulence in highly compressible isothermal
gas in a molecular cloud model. The low dissipation and wide spectral bandwidth

explained by neutralino annihilation in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric

lightest CP-even scalar h1 plus the lightest CP-odd scalar a1, with the a1
decaying into two muons. The energetic positrons needed to explain PAMELA are
thus obtained in the NMSSM simply from kinematics. The required large
annihilation cross section is obtained from an s-channel resonance with the
heavier CP-odd scalar a2. Various experiments constrain the PAMELA-favored
NMSSM parameter space, including collider searches for a light a1. These
constraints point to a unique corner of the NMSSM parameter space, having a
lightest neutralino mass around 160 GeV and a very light pseudoscalar mass less
than a GeV. A simple parameterized formula for the charge-dependent solar
modulation effects reconciles the discrepancy between the PAMELA data and the
estimated background at lower energies. We also discuss the electron and gamma

between the NMSSM predictions and Fermi LAT preliminary results and possible
resolution. An NMSSM explanation of PAMELA makes three striking and uniquely
correlated predictions: the rise in the PAMELA positron spectrum will turn over

rotating gas that is under the influence of the gravity of a super massive
black hole and is irradiated by a thin UV accretion disc and a spherical X-ray
corona. We calculate the accretion luminosity of a system based on the
accretion-rate which is assumed to be equal to the mass-supply rate at the
radius of ~10^-2 pc. For the models with high temperature gas at large radii
(~10 pc) and high luminosities, we find a strong correlation between the
mass-outflow rate (Mdot_out) and the luminosity (L). The power law index (q)
describing the Mdot_out-L relation is q=2.0(+/-0.1), which is very similar to
that for radiation-driven stellar and disc wind models. More surprisingly, for
high density at large radii, we find steady state solutions with the accretion
luminosity exceeding the Eddington limit. The super-Eddington accretion
proceeds in the equatorial region and is possible because the radiation flux
from the disc is significantly reduced in the equatorial direction due to the
geometrical foreshortening effect. In all models, an outflow is driven from an
inflow with sub-Keplerian rotation. For high temperature at large radii, the
inflow occurs over a wide range of the polar angles, and the outflow occurs in
a relatively narrow polar cone. However, for the super-Eddington cases with low
temperature at large radii, the inflow persists only very close to the
equatorial plane, resembling a thin accretion disc, while the outflow arises in
a wide range of radii and polar angles. The geometry of this extreme
inflow-outflow solution is very similar to a radiation-driven wind from a
luminous Keplerian accretion disc.

experiments. We show that if such screening occurrs via the chameleon mechanism
such as in f(R), it is possible to have order one violation of the equivalence
principle, despite the absence of explicit violation in the microscopic action.
Namely, extended objects such as galaxies or constituents thereof do not all
fall at the same rate. The chameleon mechanism can screen the scalar charge for
large objects but not for small ones (large/small is defined by the
gravitational potential and controlled by the scalar coupling). This leads to
order one fluctuations in the inertial to gravitational mass ratio. In Jordan
frame, it is no longer true that all objects move on geodesics. In contrast, if
the scalar screening occurrs via strong coupling, such as in the DGP braneworld
model, equivalence principle violation occurrs at a much reduced level. We
propose several observational tests of the chameleon mechanism: 1. small
galaxies should fall faster than large galaxies, even when dynamical friction
is negligible; 2. voids defined by small galaxies would be larger compared to
standard expectations; 3. stars and diffuse gas in small galaxies should have
different velocities, even on the same orbits; 4. lensing and dynamical mass
estimates should agree for large galaxies but disagree for small ones. We
discuss possible pitfalls in some of these tests. The cleanest is the third one
where mass estimate from HI rotational velocity could exceed that from stars by
30 % or more. To avoid blanket screening of all objects, the most promising
place to look is in voids.

analysis is performed by using the gridding method developed in Abate et al.

clustering of matter: sigma_8 and the growth index gamma. Assuming a
concordance LCDM model we find sigma_8=0.91+0.22-0.18 and gamma=0.55+0.13-0.14
after marginalising over Omega_m. These constraints are consistent with, and
have similar constraining power to, the same constraints from other current
data sets which use different methods. Recently there have been several claims
that the peculiar velocity measurements do not agree with LCDM. We find instead
although a higher value of sigma_8 and a lower value of Omega_m are preferred,
the values are still consistent when compared with WMAP5. We note that although
our analysis probes a variety of scales, the constraints will be dominated by
the smaller scales, which have the smallest uncertainties. These results show
that peculiar velocity analysis is a vital probe of cosmology, providing
competitive constraints on parameters such as sigma_8. Its sensitivity to the
derivative of growth function, particularly down to redshift zero, means it can
provide a vital low redshift anchor on the evolution of structure formation.
The importance of utilising different probes with varying systematics is also
an essential requirement for providing a consistency check on the best-fitting
cosmological model.

We present the evidence for the correlation in the GUSBAD catalog and use it to
derive the luminosity function of GRBs without using any redshifts. The
procedure involves dividing GUSBAD GRBs in five spectral classes based on their
E_pk,obs. The overall luminosity function is derived assuming that each of the
spectral classes contributes a gaussian luminosity function. Their central
luminosity is derived from the average observed Euclidean V/V_max. We explore
various forms for the GRB rate function GR(z) in predicting redshift
distributions of GRBs detected by Swift. We find that GR(z) peaks at a higher
redshift than the typical star formation history currently favored in the
literature. We consider two examples of GR(z) that successfully predict the
observed redshift distribution of Swift GRBs. With the luminosity functions in
hand, we convert the E_pk,obs-V/V_max correlation into an E_pk,obs-L_iso
correlation and a rest frame E_pk-L_iso correlation. In comparing the
E_pk-L_iso correlation with a published correlation based on GRBs with known
E_pk,obs and redshifts, we discuss the effect of Malmquist bias.

selected from the catalogue of Carrillo et al. (1999). All sources have
available Chandra (68 sources) and/or XMM-Newton (55 sources) observations.
This is the largest sample of LINERs with X-ray spectral data (60 out of the 82
objects) and significantly improves our previous analysis based on Chandra data
for 51 LINERs (Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2006). It increases both the sample size
and adds XMM-Newton data. New models permit the inclusion of double absorbers
in the spectral fits. Nuclear X-ray morphology is inferred from the compactness
of detected nuclear sources in the hard band (4.5-8.0 keV). Sixty per cent of
the sample shows a compact nuclear source and are classified as AGN candidates.
The spectral analysis indicates that best fits involve a composite model:
absorbed primary continuum and (2) soft spectrum below 2 keV described by an
absorbed scatterer and/or a thermal component. The resulting median spectra
parameters and their standard deviations are: G=2.11, <kT>=0.54 keV,
<log(NH1)>=21.32 and <log(NH2)>=21.93. We complement our X-ray results with our
analysis of HST optical images and literature data on emission lines, radio
compactness and stellar population. Adding all these multiwavelength data, we
conclude that evidence do exist supporting the AGN nature of their nuclear
engine for 80% of the sample (66 out of 82 objects).

method of separation of variables. The radial and angular equations are coupled
via an angular eigenvalue, which is determined from the Chandrasekhar-Page (CP)
equation. Obtaining accurate angular eigenvalues is a key step in studying
scattering, absorption and emission of the fermionic field.
  Here we introduce a new method for finding solutions of the CP equation.
First, we introduce a novel representation for the spin-half spherical
harmonics. Next, we decompose the angular solutions of the CP equation (the
mass-dependent spin-half spheroidal harmonics) in the spherical basis. The
method yields a three-term recurrence relation which may be solved numerically
via continued-fraction methods, or perturbatively to obtain a series expansion
for the eigenvalues. In the case $\mu = \pm \omega$ (where $\omega$ and $\mu$
are the frequency and mass of the fermion) we obtain eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions in closed form. We study the eigenvalue spectrum, and the zeros
of the maximally co-rotating mode.
  We compare our results with previous studies, and uncover and correct some
errors in the literature. We provide series expansions, tables of eigenvalues
and numerical fits across a wide parameter range, and present plots of a
selection of eigenfunctions. It is hoped this study will be a useful resource
for all researchers interested in the Dirac equation on a rotating black hole
background.

the termination shock distortion on the CMB. Temporal variations of this

the individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. We apply
this technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematically

resulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on Bayesian
model selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radial
velocities of a sample of stars from the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS). Using
this very conservative external validation test based on the GCS, we find that
there is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond the
moving groups established prior to the Hipparcos mission. This is in sharp
contrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, which
point consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. We
quantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and find
that the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocity
measurement of a single star is significant. This argues for complementary
radial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.

populations -- the powerful high-excitation, and the weak low-excitation radio
AGN (HERAGN and LERAGN, resp.) -- represent two earlier and later stages of
massive galaxy build-up. To test this, here we make use of a local (0.04<z<0.1)
sample of ~500 radio AGN with available optical spectroscopy, drawn from the
FIRST, NVSS, SDSS, and 3CRR surveys. A clear dichotomy is found between the
properties of low-excitation (absorption line AGN, and LINERs) and
high-excitation (Seyferts) radio AGN. The hosts of the first have the highest
stellar masses, reddest optical colors, and highest mass black holes but
accrete inefficiently (at low rates). On the other hand, the high-excitation
radio AGN have lower stellar masses, bluer optical colors (consistent with the
`green valley'), and lower mass black holes that accrete efficiently (at high
rates). Such properties can be explained if these two radio AGN populations
represent different stages in the formation of massive galaxies, and thus are
also linked to different phases of the `AGN feedback'.

the same pair of observables at both sites, general measurements can require

introduces new anisotropies in the CMB radiation field, but however little
attention is payed to the fraction of CMB photons that are scattered off the

moment of scattering. In this work we study this {\it blurring} effect, and
find that it has a non-negligible impact on estimations of the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect: it induces a 10% correction in 20-40% of the
clusters/groups, and a 100% correction in $\sim 5$% of the clusters in an ideal
(noiseless) experiment. We explore the possibility of using this blurring term
to probe the CMB anisotropy field at different epochs in our Universe. In
particular, we study the required precision in the removal of the kSZ that
enables detecting the blurring term $-\tau_T \delta T / T_0$ in galaxy cluster
populations placed at different redshift shells. By mapping this term in those
shells, we would provide a tomographic probe for the growth of the Integrated
Sachs Wolfe effect (ISW) during the late evolutionary stages of the Universe.
We find that the required precision of the cluster peculiar velocity removal is
of the order of 100 -- 200 km s$^{-1}$ in the redshift range 0.2 -- 0.8, after
assuming that all clusters more massive than 10$^{14}$ h$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ are
observable. These errors are comparable to the total expected linear line of
sight velocity dispersion for clusters in WMAPV cosmogony, and correspond to a
residual level of roughly 900 -- 1800 $\tau_T \mu$K per cluster, including all
types of contaminants and systematics. Were this precision requirement
achieved, then independent constraints on the intrinsic cosmological dipole
would be simultaneously provided.

modeling of Markov chains or in the discretization of convection-diffusion
problems. Due to their potential to solve sparse linear systems with an effort
that is linear in the number of unknowns, algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are
of fundamental interest for such systems. For symmetric positive definite
matrices, fundamental theoretical convergence results are established, and
efficient AMG solvers have been developed. In contrast, for non-symmetric
matrices, theoretical convergence results have been provided only recently. A
property that is sufficient for convergence is that the matrix be an M-matrix.
In this paper, we present how the simulation of incompressible fluid flows with
particle methods leads to large linear systems with sparse, non-symmetric
matrices. In each time step, the Poisson equation is approximated by meshfree
finite differences. While traditional least squares approaches do not guarantee
an M-matrix structure, an approach based on linear optimization yields
optimally sparse M-matrices. For both types of discretization approaches, we
investigate the performance of a classical AMG method, as well as an AMLI type
method. While in the considered test problems, the M-matrix structure turns out
not to be necessary for the convergence of AMG, problems can occur when it is
violated. In addition, the matrices obtained by the linear optimization
approach result in fast solution times due to their optimal sparsity.

solution also admits the familiar KK parity of UED models so that the lightest
odd KK state is stable and may be a dark matter (DM) candidate. As an
additional feature the AdS_5 warping ensures that the excited modes on the

assumed in UED models) even though the Planck scale sets the dimensions for the

not control the $L^2$ norm and a potential term involving the end value of the

the Dirichlet form. We show that Aida's modified Logarithmic Sobolev inequality
implies weak Logarithmic Sobolev Inequalities and weak Poincar\'e inequalities
with precise estimates on the order of convergence. The order of convergence in
the weak Sobolev inequalities are related to weak $L^1$ estimates on the weight

the existence of some tidal interactions that transfer the rotational angular
momentum of the Sun and using reported value of the positive secular trend in
the astronomical unit, $\frac{d}{dt}{AU} = 15 \pm 4 {(m/cy)}$, the suggested
change in the period of rotation of the Sun is about $21 {ms/cy}$ in the case
that the orbits of the eight planets have the same ""expansion rate."" This value
is sufficiently small, and at present it seems there are no observational data

inertia is also investigated. It is pointed out that the change in the moment

secular increase of AU, if the orbital ""expansion"" is happening only in the

are particularly relevant for quantum foundations and for quantum informatics.
Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert
spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its
monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the
category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian
product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds
as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets,
Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure,
these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features
are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of
internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories
FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these
features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss
posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical
constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is
all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some
very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.

clumps roughly defining the N-S direction, the same one defined by the
elongation of its X-ray surface brightness and by the axis of symmetry of the
relics. The two--body model agrees with the hypothesis that we are looking at a

clumps separated by a rest-frame velocity difference V_rf~2000 km/s at a time

in the framework of compressed sensing with emphasis on subwavelength

  The proposed formulation of the problems of inverse source/scattering is
essentially exact and leads to the random partial Fourier measurement matrix.
In the case of square-integrable targets, the proposed sampling scheme in the
Littlewood-Paley wavelet basis block-diagonalizes the scattering matrix with
each block in the form of random partial Fourier matrix corresponding to each
dyadic scale of the target. The resolution issue is analyzed from two
perspectives: stability and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The subwavelength
modes are shown to be typically unstable. The stability in the subwavelength
modes requires additional techniques such as near-field measurement or
illumination. The number of the stable modes typically increases as the
negative $d$-th (the dimension of the target) power of the distance between the
target and the sensors/source. The resolution limit is shown to be inversely
proportional to the SNR in the high SNR limit. Numerical simulations are
provided to validate the theoretical predictions.

approach. Since the threshold energy of the $K\Lambda(1520)$ channel is close
to that of $\phi N$, the contribution of this channel to $\phi$-photoproduction
near the threshold energy region may give rise to some unexpected structures.
In the transition amplitude $K\Lambda(1520) \to \phi N$, the kinematics allows
an intermediate kaon to be on-shell. This happens in the energy region where a
peak structure has been observed in $\phi$-photoproduction. In our calculations
the on-shell kaon effect indeed reproduces a peak structure, however, with a
magnitude that is far too small to explain the observed effect. As a following
step we introduce a nucleon resonance in our model. The coupling of the
resonance to the $K\Lambda(1520)$ and $\phi N$ channels is not suppressed by
the OZI rule if the resonance contains a dominant hidden strangeness component.
We find that the resonance can reproduce a peak structure of the correct
magnitude at the right energy. We also investigate the effects of coupled
channels and the resonance on the angular distribution and the spin density
matrices for $\phi$ photoproduction.

very far from the expected Lifshitz behaviour $T_{mix}=O(L^2)$, considerably

density profile of a pure cold dark matter halo toward the center, which is in
sharp contradiction with the observations of the rotation curves of cold dark
matter-dominated dwarf and low surface brightness disk galaxies, with the
latter tending to favor mass profiles with a flat central core. Many efforts
have been devoted to resolve this cusp-core problem in recent years, among
them, baryon-cold dark matter interactions are considered to be the main
physical mechanisms erasing the cold dark matter (CDM) cusp into a flat core in
the centers of all CDM halos. Clearly, baryon-cold dark matter interactions are
not customized only for CDM-dominated disk galaxies, but for all types,
including giant ellipticals. We first fit the most recent high resolution
observations of rotation curves with the Burkert profile, then use the
constrained core size-halo mass relation to calculate the lensing frequency,
and compare the predicted results with strong lensing observations.
Unfortunately, it turns out that the core size constrained from rotation curves
of disk galaxies cannot be extrapolated to giant ellipticals. We conclude that,
in the standard cosmological paradigm, baryon-cold dark matter interactions are
not universal mechanisms for galaxy formation, and therefore, they cannot be
true solutions to the cusp-core problem.

utilizes extensive simulations to examine the default overlay construction

that there is no single optimal value for this parameter using the default

the new strategy demonstrate that it outperforms the default one for all

our proposed strategy exhibits optimal behavior for a well-defined value of the
maximum number of outgoing connections, thereby removing the need to set this

other hand, magnetization, magnetic susceptibility and magnetoresistance
results point towards spin-density wave (SDW) order, possibly helical, with a
small ordering wavevector $Q \sim 0.05$ \AA$^{-1}$. Our results suggest that on
approaching the stoichiometric composition from the iron-rich side,
ferromagnetism changes into long-wavelength SDW order. In this scenario, $Q$
changes continuously from 0 to small, finite values at a Lifshitz point in the
phase diagram, which is located near $y=+0.02$. Further reducing the Fe content
suppresses the SDW transition temperature, which extrapolates to zero at
$y\approx -0.015$. Around this Fe content magnetic fluctuations dominate the
temperature dependence of the resistivity and of the heat capacity which
deviate from their conventional Fermi liquid forms, inferring the presence of a
quantum critical point. Because the critical point is located between the SDW
phase associated with stoichiometric NbFe$_2$ and the ferromagnetic order which
reemerges for very Nb-rich NbFe$_2$, the observed temperature dependences could
be attributed both to proximity to SDW order or to ferromagnetism.

such an excess can be caused by the additional energy injected by fast mode
waves refracted in the higher atmosphere due to the rapid increase of the
Alfven speed. Our model qualitatively explains the magnitude of the halo and
allows to make some predictions of its behavior that can be checked in future
observations.

out signal on other timescales than the period of the transit while preserving
the transit signal.
  We compare the performance of this new filter to a well-established
pre-detection detrending algorithm, by applying both to a set of 20 simulated
light curves containing planetary transits, stellar variability, and
instrumental noise as expected for the CoRoT space mission, and performing
analytic fits to the transits. Compared to the pre-detection benchmark, the new
post-detection filter systematically yields significantly reduced errors
(median reduction in relative error over our sample of about 40%) on the
planet-to-star radius ratio, system scale and impact parameter. This is
particularly important for active stars, where errors induced by variability
can otherwise dominate the final error budget on the planet parameters.
  Aside from improving planet parameter estimates, the new filter preserves all
signal at the orbital period of the planet, and thus could also be used to
search for light reflected by the planet.

has been investigated because of its potentials in quantum information

electrodynamics (QED). Interesting phenomena such as coherent exchange of a
single quantum between a single quantum dot and an optical cavity, called
vacuum Rabi oscillation, and highly efficient cavity QED lasers have been
reported thus far. The coexistence of vacuum Rabi oscillation and laser
oscillation appears to be contradictory in nature, because the fragile
reversible process may not survive in laser oscillation. However, recently, it
has been theoretically predicted that the strong-coupling effect could be
sustained in laser oscillation in properly designed semiconductor systems.
Nevertheless, the experimental realization of this phenomenon has remained
difficult since the first demonstration of the strong-coupling, because an
extremely high cavity quality factor and strong light-matter coupling are both
required for this purpose. Here, we demonstrate the onset of laser oscillation
in the strong-coupling regime in a single quantum dot (SQD)-cavity system. A
high-quality semiconductor optical nanocavity and strong SQD-field coupling

of quanta between the SQD and the cavity. In addition to the interesting

adiabatic coherent modes is impossible. However, this paradox occurs only in
the frame of the adiabatic picture. It is shown that no paradox exists in the

escaping into intergalactic space. For a long time cosmic ray convective
outflow from the Galaxy (galactic wind) was believed to be insignificant.
However, investigations of hydrodynamic stability and an analysis of ISM
dynamics (including cosmic rays) showed that a galactic wind was emanating near
the disk, and accelerating towards the halo, reaching its maximum velocity far
away from the disk. Therefore convective cosmic ray transport should be
important in galactic halos. Recent analysis of the gamma-ray emissivity in the
Galactic disk of EGRET data, which showed that cosmic rays are more or less
uniformly distributed in the radial direction of the disk, as well as the
interpretation of soft X-ray emission in galactic halos, give convincing
evidence of the existence of a galactic wind in star forming galaxies.

that are precise to 0.5% have been established for the components of V636 Cen.
The 0.85 Msun secondary component is moderately active with starspots and CaII

solar-scaled stellar models are unable to reproduce V636 Cen, especially its
secondary component, which is ~10% larger and ~400 K cooler than predicted.
Models adopting significantly lower mixing-length parameters l/H_p remove these

approximation (EMA), to study the quantum-confinement Stark effects for
spherical semiconducting quantum dots in the strong confinement regime of
interactive electron-hole pair and limiting weak electric field. The respective
roles of the Coulomb potential and the polarization energy are investigated in
details. Under reasonable physical assumptions, analytical calculations can be
performed. They clearly indicate that the Stark shift is a quadratic function
of the electric field amplitude in the regime of study. The resulting numerical
values are found to be in good agreement with experimental data over a
significant domain of validity.

Steingrimsson and Williams about certain permutation tableaux: we construct a
bijection between binary trees and the so-called Catalan tableaux. These
tableaux are certain Ferrers (or Young) diagrams filled with some 0's and 1's,
satisfying a certain hook condition, and are enumerated by the Catalan numbers.
They form a subclass of the permutation tableaux, enumerated by n!, introduced
by Postnikov in his study of totally non negative Grassmannians and networks.
Secondly we relate this new Catalan bijection with the totally asymmetric
exclusion process (TASEP), a very rich and well studied 1D gas model in
statistical mechanics of nonequilibrium systems. We continue some combinatorial
understanding of that model, in the spirit of works by Shapiro, Zeilberger and
more recently by Brak, Essam, Rechnitzer, Corteel, Williams, Duchi and
Schaeffer. Emphasis is made on the non-classical notion of canopy of a binary
tree, analog of the classical up-down sequence of a permutation.

estimators relative to an approximating function basis. The variable threshold
levels are estimated from the data and the basis is chosen via cross-validation
from a library of bases. The resulting estimates adapt to the unknown sparsity
of the mean function relative to the selected approximating basis, both in
terms of the mean squared error and supremum norm. These results are based on
novel oracle inequalities. In addition, uniform confidence bands for the mean
function of the process are constructed. The bands also adapt to the unknown
regularity of the mean function, are easy to compute, and do not require
explicit estimation of the covariance operator of the process. The simulation
study that complements the theoretical results shows that the new method
performs very well in practice, and is robust against large variations

this end we generalize a recently developed real-time renormalization group
method in frequency space (RTRG-FS) to allow the calculation of dynamical
correlation functions of arbitrary dot operators in systems describing spin
and/or orbital fluctuations. The resulting two-loop RG equations are
analytically solved in the weak-coupling regime. This implies that the method
can be applied provided either the voltage $V$ through the dot or the external
magnetic field $h_0$ are sufficiently large, $\max\{V,h_0\}\gg T_K$, where the
Kondo temperature $T_K$ is the scale where the system enters the

transverse spin-spin correlation and response functions as well as the
resulting fluctuation-dissipation ratios. The correlation functions in
real-frequency space can be calculated in Matsubara space without the need of
any analytical continuation. We obtain analytic results for the line-shape, the
small- and large-frequency limits and several other features like the height
and width of the peak in the transverse susceptibility at
$\Omega\approx\tilde{h}$, where $\tilde{h}$ denotes the reduced magnetic field.

on line strength, with the stronger features showing larger span. The
corresponding core wavelength shifts range from about -200 m/s for the weak Fe
I lines to almost +100 m/s in the strong Fe I features. Based on observational
results for the Sun, we argue that there should be no core wavelength shift for
Fe I lines of EW > 100 mA. The cores of the strongest lines show contributions
from the uncertain top layers of the model, where non-LTE effects and the
presence of the chromosphere, which are important in real stars, are not
accounted for. The comparison of model predictions to observed Fe I line
bisectors and core wavelength shifts for a reference star, HIP86400, shows
excellent agreement, with the exception of the core wavelength shifts of the
strongest features, for which we suspect inaccurate theoretical values. Since
this limitation does not affect the predicted line equivalent widths
significantly, we consider our 3D model validated for photospheric abundance
work.

detonation (GCD) model of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Initiation of the
detonation occurs spontaneously in a region where the length scale of the
temperature gradient extending from a flow (in which carbon burning is already
occurring) into unburned fuel is commensurate to the range of critical length
scales which have been derived from 1D simulations that resolve the initiation
of a detonation. By increasing the maximum resolution in a truncated cone that
encompasses this region, beginning somewhat before initiation of the detonation
occurs, we successfully simulate in situ the first gradient-initiated
detonation in a whole-star simulation. The detonation emerges when a
compression wave overruns a pocket of fuel situated in a Kelvin-Helmholtz cusp
at the leading edge of the inwardly directed jet of burning carbon. The
compression wave pre-conditions the temperature in the fuel in such a way that
the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism can operate and a detonation ensues. We
explore the dependence of the length scale of the temperature gradient on
spatial resolution and discuss the implications for the robustness of this
detonation mechanism. We find that the time and the location at which
initiation of the detonation occurs varies with resolution. In particular,
initiation of a detonation had not yet occurred in our highest resolution
simulation by the time we ended the simulation because of the computational
demand it required. We suggest that the turbulent shear layer surrounding the
inwardly directed jet provides the most favorable physical conditions, and
therefore the most likely location, for initiation of a detonation in the GCD
model.

$\partial_n\phi_\alpha =\mathring{c}^{(j)}_\alpha \phi_\alpha $ at the boundary
planes $\mathfrak{B}_{j=1,2}$ at $z=0$ and $z=L$. Particular attention is paid
to the cases in which $m_j$ of the $n$ variables $\mathring{c}^{(j)}_\alpha$

critical surface phase coexists with the O(n) symmetric bulk phase, provided
$d$ is sufficiently large. The $L$-dependent part of the reduced free energy
per area behaves as $\Delta_C/L^{d-1}$ as $L\to\infty$ at the bulk critical

oscillations into the chromosphere. Conclusions: The Ca II K fibrils share many
characteristics with fibrils observed in other chromospheric lines, but some
features, such as the very small widths, are unique to these observations.

extended to multitime averages of Heisenberg field operators. This task splits
naturally in two. Firstly, what class of multitime averages the -W
approximates, and, secondly, how to proceed if the average in question does not
belong to this class. To answer the first question we develop an (in principle,
exact) path-integral approach in phase-space based on the symmetric (Weyl)
ordering of creation and annihilation operators. These techniques calculate a
new class of averages which we call time-symmetric. The -W equations emerge as
an approximation within this path-integral techniques. We then show that the
answer to the second question is associated with response properties of the
system. In fact, for two-time averages Kubo's renowned formula relating the
linear response function to two-time commutators suffices. The -W is trivially
generalised to the response properties of the system allowing one to calculate
approximate time-normally ordered two-time correlation functions with
surprising ease. The techniques we develop are demonstrated for the
Bose-Hubbard model.

requiring that the radiative corrections to the CKM elements do not exceed the
experimental values. The constraints on the associated dimensionless quantities
$\delta^{d LR}_{ij}$, $j>i$, are stronger than the bounds from flavour-changing
neutral current (FCNC) processes if gluino and squarks are heavier than 500$
\gev$. The results imply that it is still possible to generate all observed
flavour violation from the soft supersymmetry-breaking terms without
conflicting with present-day data on FCNC processes. Therefore we reappraise
the idea that only $Y^q_{33}$ is different from zero at tree-level and all
other Yukawa couplings are generated radiatively. This model solves the SUSY
flavour as well as the SUSY CP problem. The presented results are published in

singular origin, it possesses early and late accelerating phases required to
account for observations. The vacuum energy has been considered as a possible
way to resolve some of these questions. The vacuum energy density induced by
free fields in an early de Sitter phase has earlier been estimated to be
proportional to $H^4$, while more recently it has been suggested that the QCD
condensate induces a term proportional to H at late times. These results have
been employed in models which are non-singular and inflationary at early times
and accelerating at late times. Here we cast these models in terms of scalar
fields and study the corresponding spectrum of primordial perturbations. At
early times the spectrum is found to be not scale-invariant, thus implying that
slow-roll inflation is still required after the phase transition induced by the
vacuum. At late times the corresponding scalar-field potential is harmonic,
with a mass of the order of the Hubble scale, a result that may be understood
in the light of the holographic conjecture.
