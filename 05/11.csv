parameter. Here, a method is presented for determining it based on the scaling
behavior of the network. Quite remarkably, both the exponent of the power-law

wherein each cell can take on q different values or levels. While increasing
the cell level is easy, reducing the level of a cell can be accomplished only
by erasing an entire block. Since block erasures are highly undesirable, coding
schemes - known as floating codes or flash codes - have been designed in order
to maximize the number of times that information stored in a flash memory can
be written (and re-written) prior to incurring a block erasure. An (n,k,t)_q
flash code C is a coding scheme for storing k information bits in n cells in
such a way that any sequence of up to t writes (where a write is a transition 0
-> 1 or 1 -> 0 in any one of the k bits) can be accommodated without a block
erasure. The total number of available level transitions in n cells is n(q-1),
and the write deficiency of C, defined as \delta(C) = n(q-1) - t, is a measure
of how close the code comes to perfectly utilizing all these transitions. For k
> 6 and large n, the best previously known construction of flash codes achieves
a write deficiency of O(qk^2). On the other hand, the best known lower bound on
write deficiency is \Omega(qk). In this paper, we present a new construction of
flash codes that approaches this lower bound to within a factor logarithmic in
k. To this end, we first improve upon the so-called ""indexed"" flash codes, due
to Jiang and Bruck, by eliminating the need for index cells in the Jiang-Bruck
construction. Next, we further increase the number of writes by introducing a
new multi-stage (recursive) indexing scheme. We then show that the write
deficiency of the resulting flash codes is O(qk\log k) if q \geq \log_2k, and
at most O(k\log^2 k) otherwise.

short GRB 081024B can be caused by synchrotron and self-Compton emission in the
context of either the internal or external shock models. For the internal shock
scenario, we explore the possibility of generating the high energy photons
directly by means of the synchrotron process, or inverse Compton emission in
which target photons are synchrotron photons produced in internal shocks taking
place in a lately emitted shell (delayed internal shocks). In the external
shock scenario, we test whether the high energy tail can be an extension of the
afterglow synchrotron emission, or alternatively the inverse Compton component
associated with the afterglow synchrotron photons. For the internal shock
scenario, we conclude that only an inverse Compton component from delayed
internal shocks can explain the high energy tail that extends to the GeV range.
In the external shock scenario, we show that the high energy tail may be
interpreted as synchrotron afterglow emission, if the slow cooling phase starts
as early as a few seconds after the trigger. On the other hand, the observed

efficiency of trapping processes performed on them. In this paper, we show that
transport efficiency is much lower in a fractal scale-free network than in
non-fractal networks. To this end, we examine a simple random walk with a fixed
trap at a given position on a fractal scale-free network. We calculate
analytically the mean first-passage time (MFPT) as a measure of the efficiency
for the trapping process, and obtain a closed-form expression for MFPT, which
agrees with direct numerical calculations. We find that, in the limit of a
large network order $V$, the MFPT $<T>$ behaves superlinearly as $<T > \sim
V^{{3/2}}$ with an exponent 3/2 much larger than 1, which is in sharp contrast
to the scaling $<T > \sim V^{\theta}$ with $\theta \leq 1$, previously obtained
for non-fractal scale-free networks. Our results indicate that the degree
distribution of scale-free networks is not sufficient to characterize trapping
processes taking place on them. Since various real-world networks are
simultaneously scale-free and fractal, our results may shed light on the
understanding of trapping processes running on real-life systems.

a UV completion of General Relativity (GR) or its infra-red modification,
probably with a strongly coupled scalar mode. Although the generic vacuum of
the theory is anti-de Sitter one, particular limits of the theory allow for the
Minkowski vacuum. In this limit (though without consideration of the strongly
coupled scalar field) post-Newtonian coefficients of spherically symmetric
solutions coincide with those of the General Relativity. Thus the deviations
from the convenient GR should be tested beyond the post-Newtonian corrections,
that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales. In this
letter we consider potentially observable properties of black holes in the
deformed Horava-Lifshitz gravity with Minkowski vacuum: the gravitational
lensing and quasinormal modes. We have showed that the bending angle is
seemingly smaller in the considered Horava-Lifshitz gravity than in GR. The
quasinormal modes of black holes are longer lived and have larger real
oscillation frequency in the Horava-Lifshitz gravity than in GR. These
corrections should be observable in the near future experiments on lensing and
by gravitational antennas, helping to constrain parameters of the
Horava-Lifshitz gravity or to discard it.

low metallicity environment. We discuss the possibility and theoretical aspects
of using Lyman alpha emission properties of long GRB host galaxies as a
metallicity indicator of high redshift GRB environments, where direct
metallicity measurements are not easy. We propose to use the fraction of
Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) in long GRB host galaxies as a function of UV
luminosity, which can be compared with star-formation-rate weighted LAE
fraction of Lyman-break galaxies as the standard in the case of no metallicity
dependence. There are two important effects of metallicity dependence of long
GRB rate to change the LAE fraction of host galaxies. One is the enhancement of
intrinsic Ly-alpha equivalent width (EW) by stronger ionizing UV luminosity of
low metallicity stellar population, and the other is extinction by interstellar
dust to change the observable EW. Based on a latest theoretical model of LAEs
that reproduce observations, we argue that the latter is likely to work in the
opposite direction to the former, i.e., to decrease LAE fraction if GRBs
preferentially occur in low-metallicity environments, because of the clumpy
inter-stellar medium effect. The high LAE fraction of GRB host galaxies
indicated by observations is quantitatively be explained by the LAE model if
GRBs occur when Z < 0.1Z_sun, although this result is still indicative because
of the limited statistics and theoretical uncertainties. This result
demonstrates that the LAE statistics of GRB hosts may give us useful
information in the future.

intersection of all unit balls B(v,1) centered at v, where v ranges over V,
henceforth denoted by B(V) is the ball polytope associated with V. Note that
B(V) is non-empty iff the circumradius of V is <= 1. After some preparatory
discussion on spherical convexity and spindle convexity, the paper focuses on
two central themes. [a] Define the boundary complex of B(V) (assuming it is
non-empty, of course), i.e., define its vertices, edges and facets in dimension
3 (in dimension 2 this complex is just a circuit), and investigate its basic
properties. [b] Apply results of this investigation to characterize finite sets
of diameter 1 in (Euclidean) 3-space for which the diameter is attained a
maximal number of times as a segment (of length 1) with both endpoints in V. A
basic result for such a characterization goes back to Grunbaum, Heppes and
Straszewicz, who proved independently that the diameter of V is attained at
most 2|V|-2 times, thus affirming a conjecture of Vazsonyi from circa 1935.
Call V extremal if its diameter is attained this maximal number (2|V|-2) of
times. We extend the aforementioned basic result by showing that V is extremal
iff V coincides with the set of vertices of its ball polytope B(V) and show
that in this case the boundary complex of B(V) is self-dual in some strong

propose a block Markov encoding and relaying scheme that exploits such channel
variations. By deriving a general cut-set upper bound and an achievable rate
region, we characterize the sum capacity for some classes of channel

uniformly distributed, the sum capacity is given by the minimum average rank of
the channel matrices constructed by all cuts that separate the entire sources

New section (Section 3.3) added",,,,"cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the philosophy and phenomenal success of compressed sensing, the
problem of reconstructing a matrix from a sampling of its entries has attracted
much attention recently. Such a problem can be viewed as an
information-theoretic variant of the well-studied matrix completion problem,
and the main objective is to design an efficient algorithm that can reconstruct
a matrix by inspecting only a small number of its entries. Although this is an
impossible task in general, Cand\`es and co-authors have recently shown that
under a so-called incoherence assumption, a rank $r$ $n\times n$ matrix can be
reconstructed using semidefinite programming (SDP) after one inspects
$O(nr\log^6n)$ of its entries. In this paper we propose an alternative approach
that is much more efficient and can reconstruct a larger class of matrices by
inspecting a significantly smaller number of the entries. Specifically, we
first introduce a class of so-called stable matrices and show that it includes
all those that satisfy the incoherence assumption. Then, we propose a
randomized basis pursuit (RBP) algorithm and show that it can reconstruct a
stable rank $r$ $n\times n$ matrix after inspecting $O(nr\log n)$ of its
entries. Our sampling bound is only a logarithmic factor away from the
information-theoretic limit and is essentially optimal. Moreover, the runtime
of the RBP algorithm is bounded by $O(nr^2\log n+n^2r)$, which compares very
favorably with the $\Omega(n^4r^2\log^{12}n)$ runtime of the SDP-based
algorithm. Perhaps more importantly, our algorithm will provide an exact
reconstruction of the input matrix in polynomial time. By contrast, the
SDP-based algorithm can only provide an approximate one in polynomial time.

noncentrosymmetrically while flux emerges at an outer part of the granular
cell. (3) Magnetic flux emergence as a cluster of mixed polarities is detected
at the position of a granule as soon as the granule breaks up. (4) A dipole
emerges accompanying with the development of a granule, and the two elements of
the dipole root in the adjacent intergranular lanes and face each other across
the granule. Advected by the horizontal granular motion, the positive element
of the dipole then cancels with pre-existing negative flux. (5) Flux
cancellation also takes place between a positive element, which is advected by
granular flow, and its surrounding negative flux. (6) While magnetic flux
cancellation takes place at a granular cell, the granule shrinks and then
disappears. (7) Horizontal magnetic fields enhance at the places where dipoles
emerge and where opposite polarities cancel with each other, but only the
horizontal fields between the dipolar elements point orderly from the positive
element to the negative one. Our results reveal that granules and small-scale
magnetic flux influence each other. Granular flow advects magnetic flux, and
magnetic flux evolution suppresses granular development. There exist extremely
large Doppler blue-shifts at the site of one cancelling magnetic element. This
phenomenon may be caused by the upward flow produced by magnetic reconnection
below the photosphere.

time-dependence of the magnetic field that is induced by kinematic $\alpha^{2}$

$\alpha$ effect which can be derived from an underlying columnar flow. The
investigated geometry variations concern, in particular, the aspect ratio of
height to radius of the cylinder, and the thickness of the annular space to
which the columnar flow is restricted. Motivated by the quest for laboratory
dynamos which exhibit Earth-like features, we start with modifications of the
Karlsruhe dynamo facility. Its dynamo action is reasonably described by an
$\alpha^{2}$ mechanism with anisotropic $\alpha$ tensor. We find a critical
aspect ratio below which the dominant magnetic field structure changes from an
equatorial dipole to an axial dipole. Similar results are found for
$\alpha^{2}$ dynamos working in an annular space when a radial dependence of

additional productions of turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent potential energy
(TPE) and turbulent flux of potential temperature due to large-scale internal
gravity waves (IGW). Main effects of IGW are following: the maximal value of
the flux Richardson number (universal constant 0.2-0.25 in the no-IGW regime)
becomes strongly variable. In the vertically homogeneous stratification, it
increases with increasing wave energy and can even exceed 1. In the
heterogeneous stratification, when IGW propagate towards stronger
stratification, the maximal flux Richardson number decreases with increasing
wave energy, reaches zero and then becomes negative. In other words, the
vertical flux of potential temperature becomes counter-gradient. IGW also
reduce anisotropy of turbulence and increase the share of TPE in the turbulent
total energy. Depending on the direction (downward or upward), IGW either
strengthen or weaken the total vertical flux of momentum. Predictions from the
proposed model are consistent with available data from atmospheric and
laboratory experiments, direct numerical simulations and large-eddy
simulations.

typings for $\lambda$-terms in intersection type systems. Expansion variables
(E-variables) were introduced at the end of the 1990s to simplify and help
mechanise expansion. Recently, E-variables have been further simplified and
generalised to also allow calculating other type operators than just
intersection. There has been much work on semantics for intersection type
systems, but only one such work on intersection type systems with E-variables.
That work established that building a semantics for E-variables is very
challenging. Because it is unclear how to devise a space of meanings for
E-variables, that work developed instead a space of meanings for types that is
hierarchical in the sense of having many degrees (denoted by indexes). However,
although the indexed calculus helped identify the serious problems of giving a
semantics for expansion variables, the sound realisability semantics was only
complete when one single E-variable is used and furthermore, the universal type
$\omega$ was not allowed. In this paper, we are able to overcome these
challenges. We develop a realisability semantics where we allow an arbitrary
(possibly infinite) number of expansion variables and where $\omega$ is
present. We show the soundness and completeness of our proposed semantics.

photonic qubits by well controlled two photon interactions. However, the
dependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it
difficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode
model for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,
we analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse
shape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is
shown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be
derived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The
effect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from
the density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output
theory. As an example, the resonant non-linearity of a single two level atom is
characterized. The results indicate that the most efficient non-linear effect
may not be the widely studied single mode phase shift, but the transfer of one
of the photons to an orthogonal mode distinguished by its temporal and spectral
properties.

with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS). The contribution of nuclear
activity to the bolometric luminosity in these systems is quantified using six
independent methods that span a range in wavelength and give consistent results
within ~ +/-10-15% on average. The average derived AGN contribution in ULIRGs
is ~35-40%, ranging from ~15-35% among ""cool"" (f_25/f_60 =< 0.2) optically
classified HII-like and LINER ULIRGs to ~50 and ~75% among warm Seyfert 2 and
Seyfert 1 ULIRGs, respectively. This number exceeds ~80% in PG QSOs. ULIRGs
fall in one of three distinct AGN classes: (1) objects with small extinctions
and large PAH equivalent widths are highly starburst-dominated; (2) systems
with large extinctions and modest PAH equivalent widths have larger AGN
contributions, but still tend to be starburst-dominated; and (3) ULIRGs with
both small extinctions and small PAH equivalent widths host AGN that are at
least as powerful as the starbursts. The AGN contributions in class 2 ULIRGs
are more uncertain than in the other objects, and we cannot formally rule out
the possibility that these objects represent a physically distinct type of
ULIRGs. A morphological trend is seen along the sequence (1)-(2)-(3), in
general agreement with the standard ULIRG - QSO evolution scenario and
suggestive of a broad peak in extinction during the intermediate stages of
merger evolution. However, the scatter in this sequence, implies that black
hole accretion, in addition to depending on the merger phase, also has a strong
chaotic/random component, as in local AGN. (abridged)

$\omega_N(\epsilon)$ has a nonanalyticity at the same value $\epsilon=v_c$ of
its argument for any finite value of the number of degrees of freedom $N$. The
presence of the kinetic energy weakens the nonanalyticities such that, if the
configurational entropy is $p$ times differentiable, the entropy is $p+\lfloor
N/2 \rfloor$-times differentiable. In the thermodynamic limit, however, the
behaviour is very different: The nonanalyticities do not longer occur at the
same values of the arguments, but the nonanalyticity of the microcanonical
entropy is shifted to a larger energy. These results give a general explanation
of the peculiar behaviour previously observed for the mean-field spherical
model. With the hypercubic model we provide a further example illustrating our
results.

  A lower bound for the infimum Dirichlet energy for a given homotopy class is
obtained as a sum of minimal connections between fractional defects at the

incorporating certain nonabelian homotopy invariants. For a rectangular prism,
upper bounds for the infimum Dirichlet energy are obtained from locally
conformal solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations, with the ratio of the
upper and lower bounds bounded independently of homotopy type. However, since
the homotopy classes are not weakly closed, the infimum may not be realised;
the existence and regularity properties of continuous local minimisers of given
homotopy type are open questions. Numerical results suggest that some homotopy
classes always contain smooth minimisers, while others may or may not depending
on the geometry of $P$. Numerical results modelling a bistable device suggest
that the observed nematic configurations may be distinguished topologically.

numerical method for solving the kinetic equation over a large range of

equations. The new algorithm is validated against some analytic calculations of
the Kolmogorov-Zakharov constant for some families of model interaction

problems in which the finiteness of the dissipation scale is an essential
feature. Firstly, it is shown that for finite capacity cascades, the
dissipation of energy becomes independent of the cut-off frequency as this
cut-off is taken to infinity. This is an explicit indication of the presence of
a dissipative anomaly. Secondly, a preliminary numerical study is presented of
the so-called bottleneck effect in a wave turbulence context. It is found that
the structure of the bottleneck depends non-trivially on the interaction

devoted to the multiplicity of O-type stars in the young open cluster NGC2244
and in the Mon OB2 association. Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring was
performed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. For
each star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to search
for line shifts and profile variations. We also measure the projected
rotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. Results. In our
sample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,
though only a few scattered observations were available. Our results now reveal
a more complex situation. Our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries
(HD46149 in NGC2244 and HD46573 in MonOB2). The first object is a long-period
double-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remains
uncertain and the second object is classified as an SB1 system with a period of
about 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us to
derive a unique orbital solution for this system. We also classify another star
as variable in radial velocity (HD46150) and we detect line profile variations
in two rapid rotators (HD46056 and HD46485). Conclusions. This spectroscopic
investigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of O-stars
in NGC2244 and reveals the lack of short-period O+OB systems in this cluster.
In addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studied
clusters (NGC6231 and IC1805) puts forward possible hints of a relation between
stellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theories
about the formation and early evolution of hot stars.

a halo mass of ~1e12 solar masses. In general, dark matter halos are expected
to contribute significantly to the masses of galaxies and should not be ignored

how this can have a potentially profound effect on the disruption timescales of
globular clusters, suggesting that we may underestimate the rate at which

investigate how this assumption affects the best-fit beaming parameter,
overestimates the effective diameter and underestimates the albedo at large
phase angles, by testing NEATM on thermal IR fluxes generated from simulated
asteroid surfaces with different thermal inertia. We compare NEATM to radar
diameters and find that NEATM overestimates the diameter when the beaming
parameter is fitted to multi-wavelength observations and underestimates the
diameter when the default beaming parameter is used. The Night Emission
Simulated Thermal Model (NESTM) is introduced. NESTM models the night side
temperature as an iso-latitudinal fraction (f) of the maximum day side
temperature (Maximum temperature calculated for NEATM with beaming parameter =
1). A range of f is found for different thermal parameters, which depend on the
thermal inertia. NESTM diameters are compared with NEATM and radar diameters,
and it is shown that NESTM may reduce the systematic bias in overestimating
diameters. It is suggested that a version of the NESTM which assumes the

~25 micro Jy per 14x17 mas2 beam was achieved, and in 7 out of 11 sources
unresolved radio emission was securely detected. The detected radio emission of
each source accounts for ~30-100 % of the total source flux density. The
physical extent of this emission is ~<150 pc, and the derived properties
indicate that this emission originates from an active galactic nucleus (AGN).
The missing flux density is difficult to account for by star-formation alone,
so radio components associated with jets of physical size >~150 pc, and ~< 40
kpc are likely to be present in most of the sources. Amongst the observed
sample steep, flat, gigahertz-peaked and compact-steep spectrum sources are all

are also inferred, suggesting that in these sources, the obscuration must be
due to dust in the host galaxy, rather than the torus invoked by the unified
schemes. Comparing the total to core (~< 150 pc) radio luminosities of this

similar to those of the high-radio-luminosity end of the low-redshift

numerically investigated. From the results of the molecular dynamics
simulation, we found that the deposited clusters exhibit a transition from
multilayered adsorption to monolayered adsorption at a critical incident speed.
Employing the energy conservation law, we can explain the behavior of the ratio
of the number of atoms adsorbed on the substrate to the cluster size. The
boundary shape of the deposited cluster depends strongly on the incident speed
and some unstable modes grow during the spread of the deposited cluster on the
substrate. We also discuss the wettability between different Lennard-Jones
atoms.

the occurrence of several prominent outbursts. Starting from 1999, the Whole
Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium has organized various multifrequency
campaigns on this blazar, collecting tens of thousands of data points. One of
the main issues in the study of this huge dataset has been the search for
correlations between the optical and radio flux variations, and for possible
periodicities in the light curves. The analysis of the data assembled during
the first four campaigns (comprising also archival data to cover the period
1968-2003) revealed a fair optical-radio correlation in 1994-2003, with a delay
of the hard radio events of ~100 days. Moreover, various statistical methods
suggested the existence of a radio periodicity of ~8 years. In 2004 the WEBT
started a new campaign to extend the dataset to the most recent observing
seasons, in order to possibly confirm and better understand the previous
results. In this campaign we have collected and assembled about 11000 new
optical observations from twenty telescopes, plus near-IR and radio data at
various frequencies. Here, we perform a correlation analysis on the long-term
R-band and radio light curves. In general, we confirm the ~100-day delay of the
hard radio events with respect to the optical ones, even if longer (~200-300
days) time lags are also found in particular periods. The radio
quasi-periodicity is confirmed too, but the ""period"" seems to progressively
lengthen from 7.4 to 9.3 years in the last three cycles. The optical and radio
behaviour in the last forty years suggests a scenario where geometric effects
play a major role. In particular, the alternation of enhanced and suppressed

$(q_k,q_{k+1})\to (q_{k+1},q_{k+2})$. The basic idea here, is that only the
partial derivatives of the estimation of the action integral of the Lagrangian
are needed in the general theory. The analytic calculation of these
derivatives, give raise to a new integral which depends not on the Lagrangian
but on the Euler--Lagrange vector, which in the continuous and exact case
vanishes. Since this new integral can only be computed through a numerical
method based on some internal grid points, we can locally fit the exact curve
by demanding the Euler--Lagrange vector to vanish at these grid points. Thus
the integral vanishes, and the process dramatically simplifies the calculation
of high order approximations. The new technique is tested for high order
solutions in the two-body problem with high eccentricity (up to 0.99) and in

used in scattering experiments. Only coherent scattering probes can elucidate
collective molecular motions. While phonons in crystals were studied for half a
century now, the study of collective molecular motions in soft-matter and

material properties and interactions, and are crucial to establish
dynamics-function relations. We review properties of neutrons and x-rays and
derive the origin of coherent and incoherent scattering. Taking molecular
motions in membranes and proteins as example, the difference between coherent

be accessed in x-ray and neutron scattering experiments. Matching of coherent
properties of the scattering probe may become important in soft-matter and
biology because of (1) the missing long ranged order and (2) the large length
scales involved. It is likely to be important in systems, where fluctuating
nanoscale domains strongly determine material properties. Inelastic scattering
can provide very local structural information in disordered systems. Inelastic
neutron scattering experiments point to a coexistence of short-lived nanoscale

to solve when the matrices are large. In this paper, we propose fixed point and
Bregman iterative algorithms for solving the nuclear norm minimization problem

we get a very fast, robust and powerful algorithm, which we call FPCA (Fixed
Point Continuation with Approximate SVD), that can solve very large matrix rank
minimization problems. Our numerical results on randomly generated and real
matrix completion problems demonstrate that this algorithm is much faster and
provides much better recoverability than semidefinite programming solvers such
as SDPT3. For example, our algorithm can recover 1000 x 1000 matrices of rank
50 with a relative error of 1e-5 in about 3 minutes by sampling only 20 percent

Cluster Survey (VCS). These galaxies belong to the main concentration of the
Virgo cluster (VC) and present absolute magnitudes $-18.5<M_z<-22.5$. We used
the public GC catalog of Jord\'an et al. (2008) and separated the GC population
into metal poor (blue) and metal rich (red) according to their integrated
colors. The galaxy properties were taken from \citet{Peng:2008}. We found that:
1) The specific frequencies ($S_N$) of total and blue GC populations increase
as a function of the projected galaxy distances $r_p$ to M87. A similar result
is observed when 3-dimensional distances $r_{3D}$ are used. The same behaviours
are found if the analysis are made using the number of GCs per $10^9\Msun$
($T$). The correlations with the clustocentric distance of the host galaxy are
interpreted as evidence of GCs stripping due to tidal forces. 2) No correlation
is found between the slope of GC density profiles of host galaxies and the
galaxy distance to M87 (Virgo central galaxy). 3) We also computed the local
density of GCs ($\rho_{out}$) located further than $6.2 \kpc$ from the galaxy
center for nine galaxies of our sample. We find that the GC population around
most of these galaxies is mainly composed of blue GCs.
  Our results suggest that the number and the fraction of blue and red GCs
observed in elliptical galaxies located near the centers of massive clusters,
could be significantly different from the underlying GC population. These
differences could be explained by tidal stripping effects that occur as
galaxies approach the centers of clusters.
