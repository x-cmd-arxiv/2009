effects of purely mechanical feedback from super massive black holes (SMBHs) in
the evolution of elliptical galaxies for a broad range of feedback efficiencies
and compare the results to four major observational constraints. In particular,
we focus on 1) the central black hole to stellar mass ratio of the host galaxy,
2) the lifetime of the luminous quasar phase, 3) the mass of stars formed in
the host galaxy within the last Gyr, and 4) the X-ray luminosity of the hot
diffuse gas. As a result, we try to pin down the most successful range of
mechanical feedback efficiencies. We find that while low feedback efficiencies
result in too much growth of the SMBH, high efficiencies totally blow out the
hot interstellar gas, and the models are characterized by very low thermal
X-ray luminosity well below the observed range. The net lifetime of the quasar
phase is strongly coupled to the mass ratio between SMBH and its host galaxy,
while the X-ray luminosity is generally correlated to the recent star formation
within the last Gyr. When considering the popularly adopted model of the
constant feedback efficiency, the feedback energy deposited into the ambient
medium should be more than 0.01% of the SMBH accretion energy to be consistent
with the SMBH mass to stellar mass ratio in the local universe. Yet, the X-ray
luminosity of the hot gas favors about 0.005% of the accretion energy as the
mechanical AGN feedback energy. We conclude that the purely mechanical feedback
mode is unlikely to be simultaneously compatible with all four observable
tests, even allowing a broad range of feedback efficiencies, and that including
both radiative and mechanical feedback together may be a solution to comply the
observational constraints. [abridged]

axion-like interactions, and of their possible effects at the Large Hadron
Collider. One important feature of these models is the presence of one
pseudoscalar which is a generalization of the Peccei-Quinn axion. This can be
very light and very weakly coupled, with a mass which is unrelated to its
couplings to the gauge fields, described by Wess Zumino interactions.
  We discuss two independent realizations of these models, one derived from the
theory of intersecting branes and the second one obtained by decoupling one
chiral fermion per generation (one right-handed neutrino) from an anomaly-free
mother theory. The key features of this second realization are illustrated
using a simple example.
  Charge assignments of intersecting branes can be easily reproduced by the
chiral decoupling approach, which remains more general at the level of the
solution of its anomaly equations. Using considerations based on its lifetime,
we show that in brane models the axion can be dark matter only if its mass is
ultralight ($\sim 10^{-4}$ eV), while in the case of fermion decoupling it can
reach the GeV region, due to the absence of fermion couplings between the heavy
Higgs and the light fermion spectrum. For a GeV axion derived from brane models
we present a detailed discussion of its production rates at the LHC.

developed a diffuse cosmic ray model based on the study of different shock

continuous trajectories of walker motion. This approach may open a way to treat
Levy flights or Levy random walks in inhomogeneous media or systems with
boundaries in the future.
  The proposed model assumes the velocity of a wandering particle to be
affected by a linear friction and a nonlinear Langevin force whose intensity is
proportional to the magnitude of the velocity for its large values. Based on
the singular perturbation technique the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation is
analyzed and the relationship between the system parameters and the Levy
exponent is found. Following actually the previous paper we demonstrate also
that anomalously long displacements of the wandering particle are caused by
extremely large fluctuations in the particle velocity whose duration is
determined by the system parameters rather than the duration of the observation
interval. In this way we overcome the problem of ascribing to Levy random walks
non-Markov properties.

Fe, a depleted element in QSO absorbers and the local ISM, and Zn a relatively
undepleted element. In each case, the N(HI)-weighted mean metallicity is higher
and shows faster evolution in sub-DLAs than the classical DLA systems. Large
grids of photoionisation models over the sub-DLA \nhI range with CLOUDY show
that the ionisation corrections to the abundances are in general small, however
the fraction of ionized H can be up to ~90 per cent. The individual spectra
have been shifted to the rest frame of the absorber and averaged together to
determine the average properties of these systems at z<1.5. We find that the
average abundance pattern of the Sub-DLA systems is similar to the gas in the
halo of the Milky Way, with an offset of ~0.3 dex in the overall metallicity.
Both DLAs and Sub-DLAs show similar characteristics in their relative
abundances patterns, although the DLAs have smaller <[Mn/Zn]> as well as higher
<[Ti/Zn]> and <[Cr/Zn]>. We calculate the contribution of sub-DLAs to the metal
budget of the Universe, and find that the sub-DLA systems at z<1.5 contain a
comoving density of metals Omega_met (3.5-15.8)x10^{5} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, at least
twice the comoving density of metals in the DLA systems. The sub-DLAs do
however track global chemical evolution models much more closely than do the
DLAs, perhaps indicating that they are a less dust biased metallicity indicator
of galaxies at high redshifts than the DLA systems.

and utilizing spectrum holes without interfering with the legacy systems. In
this paper we propose novel cooperative communication models and show how
deploying such cooperations between a pair of secondary transmitter and
receiver assists them in identifying spectrum opportunities more reliably.
These cooperations are facilitated by dynamically and opportunistically
assigning one of the secondary users as a relay to assist the other one which
results in more efficient spectrum hole detection. Also, we investigate the
impact of erroneous detection of spectrum holes and thereof missing
communication opportunities on the capacity of the secondary channel. The
capacity of the secondary users with interference-avoiding spectrum access is
affected by 1) how effectively the availability of vacant spectrum is sensed by
the secondary transmitter-receiver pair, and 2) how correlated are the
perceptions of the secondary transmitter-receiver pair about network spectral
activity. We show that both factors are improved by using the proposed
cooperative protocols. One of the proposed protocols requires explicit
information exchange in the network. Such information exchange in practice is
prone to wireless channel errors (i.e., is imperfect) and costs bandwidth loss.
We analyze the effects of such imperfect information exchange on the capacity
as well as the effect of bandwidth cost on the achievable throughput. The
protocols are also extended to multiuser secondary networks.

undergo thermonuclear fusion. At different mass accretion rates different
burning regimes are discerned. Theoretical models predict helium fusion to
proceed as a thermonuclear runaway for accretion rates below the Eddington
limit and as stable burning above this limit. Observations, however, place the
boundary close to 10% of the Eddington limit. We study the effect of
rotationally induced transport processes on the stability of helium burning.
For the first time detailed calculations of thin helium shell burning on
neutron stars are performed using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code
including rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields. We find that in
most cases the instabilities from the magnetic field provide the dominant
contribution to the chemical mixing, while Eddington-Sweet circulations become
important at high rotation rates. As helium is diffused to greater depths, the
stability of the burning is increased, such that the critical accretion rate
for stable helium burning is found to be lower. Combined with a higher heat
flux from the crust, as suggested by recent studies, turbulent mixing could
explain the observed critical accretion rate. Furthermore, close to this
boundary we find oscillatory burning, which previous studies have linked to mHz
QPOs. In models where we continuously lower the heat flux from the crust, the
period of the oscillations increases by up to several tens of percents, similar
to the observed frequency drift, suggesting that this drift could be caused by
the cooling of deeper layers.

dimension. Although in theory it is clear that this is possible, the difficulty
lies in the construction of algorithms that perform the recovery efficiently,
as well as determining which kind of linear measurements allow for the
reconstruction. There have been two distinct major approaches to sparse
recovery that each present different benefits and shortcomings. The first,
L1-minimization methods such as Basis Pursuit, use a linear optimization
problem to recover the signal. This method provides strong guarantees and
stability, but relies on Linear Programming, whose methods do not yet have
strong polynomially bounded runtimes. The second approach uses greedy methods
that compute the support of the signal iteratively. These methods are usually
much faster than Basis Pursuit, but until recently had not been able to provide
the same guarantees. This gap between the two approaches was bridged when we
developed and analyzed the greedy algorithm Regularized Orthogonal Matching
Pursuit (ROMP). ROMP provides similar guarantees to Basis Pursuit as well as
the speed of a greedy algorithm. Our more recent algorithm Compressive Sampling

repeated imaging on a cadence of 2-3 weeks over a 2.2 year baseline, the
Spitzer/IRAC Dark Field. The individual epochs reach a typical 5-sigma depth of
1 uJy in IRAC Channel 1 (3.6 um). Requiring a minimum of four epochs coverage,
the total effective area searched is 214 sq arcminutes. The unprecedented depth
and multi-epochal nature of these data make it ideal for a first foray to
detect transient objects which may be candidate luminous Pair Instability
Supernovae from the primordial-metallicity first stars. The search was
conducted over a broad range of timescales, allowing for different durations of
the putative candidates' light curve plateau phases. All candidates were vetted
by inspection of the Spitzer imaging data, as well as deep HST/ACS F814W
imaging available over the full field. While many resolved-source objects were
found with Spitzer variability, no transient objects could plausibly be
identified as high-redshift supernovae candidates. The resulting 95% confidence
level upper limit is 23/sq deg/yr, for sources with plateau timescales under
400/(1+z) days and brightnesses above ~1 uJy.

approach to analyse the SMG data. Namely, we present the first self-consistent
UV-to-radio spectral energy distribution fits of 76 SMGs with spectroscopic
redshifts using all photometric datapoints from ultraviolet to radio

formation rate 713 MSun yr^-1 for SMGs at z>0.5), moderately dust-obscured
(median A_V~2 mag), hosting significant stellar populations (median stellar
mass 3.7x10^11 MSun) of which only a minor part has been formed in the ongoing
starburst episode. This implies that in the past, SMGs experienced either
another starburst episode or merger with several galaxies. The properties of
SMGs suggest that they are progenitors of present-day elliptical galaxies. We
find that these bright SMGs contribute significantly to the cosmic star
formation rate density (~20%) and stellar mass density (~30-50%) at redshifts
2-4. Using number counts at low fluxes we find that as much as 80% of the
cosmic star formation at these redshifts took place in SMGs brighter than 0.1
mJy. We find evidence that a linear infrared-radio correlation holds for SMGs
in an unchanged form up to redshift of 3.6, though its normalization is offset
from the local relation by a factor of ~2.1 towards higher radio luminosities.

MHD simulations of isolated clusters including radiative cooling and

of the intracluster medium (ICM) can have cooling timescales of ~200 Myr or
shorter--in order to prevent a cooling catastrophe the ICM must be heated by
some mechanism such as AGN feedback or thermal conduction from the thermal
reservoir at large radii. The cores of galaxy clusters are linearly unstable to
the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI), which significantly changes
the thermodynamics of the cluster core. The HBI is a convective,
buoyancy-driven instability that rearranges the magnetic field to be
preferentially perpendicular to the temperature gradient. For a wide range of
parameters, our simulations demonstrate that in the presence of the HBI, the
effective radial thermal conductivity is reduced to less than 10% of the full
Spitzer conductivity. With this suppression of conductive heating, the cooling
catastrophe occurs on a timescale comparable to the central cooling time of the
cluster. Thermal conduction alone is thus unlikely to stabilize clusters with
low central entropies and short central cooling timescales. High central
entropy clusters have sufficiently long cooling times that conduction can help
stave off the cooling catastrophe for cosmologically interesting timescales.

ionospheric distortions also probes ionospheric structure in an unprecedented
way. Here we explore one aspect of this new type of ionospheric measurement,
the differential refraction of celestial source pairs as a function of their
angular separation. This measurement probes variations in the spatial gradient
of the line-of-sight total electron content (TEC) to 0.001 TECU/km accuracy
over spatial scales of under 10 km to over 100 km. We use data from the VLA

complete 74 MHz survey of the entire sky visible to the Very Large Array (VLA)

observations, all calibrated in a standard way. While ionospheric spatial
structure varies greatly from one observation to the next, when analyzed over
hundreds of hours, statistical patterns become apparent. We present a detailed
characterization of how the median differential refraction depends on source
pair separation, elevation and time of day. We find that elevation effects are
large, but geometrically predictable and can be ""removed"" analytically using a
""thin-shell"" model of the ionosphere. We find significantly greater ionospheric
spatial variations during the day than at night. These diurnal variations
appear to affect the larger angular scales to a greater degree indicating that
they come from disturbances on relatively larger spatial scales (100s of km,
rather than 10s of km).

bright end of the LF is consistent with passive evolution but there is a
significant build-up of the faint end of the red sequence towards lower
redshift. There is a weak dependence of the LF on cluster velocity dispersion
for EDisCS but no such dependence for the SDSS clusters. We find tentative
evidence that red sequence galaxies brighter than a threshold magnitude are
already in place, and that this threshold evolves to fainter magnitudes toward
lower redshifts. We compare the EDisCS LFs with the LF of co-eval red sequence
galaxies in the field and find that the bright end of the LFs agree. However,
relative to the number of bright red galaxies, the field has more faint red
galaxies than clusters at 0.6<z<0.8 but fewer at 0.4<z<0.6, implying
differential evolution. We compare the total light in the EDisCS cluster red
sequences to the total red sequence light in our SDSS cluster sample. Clusters
at 0.4<z<0.8 must increase their luminosity on the red sequence (and therefore
stellar mass in red galaxies) by a factor of 1-3 by z=0. The necessary
processes that add mass to the red sequence in clusters predict local clusters
that are over-luminous as compared to those observed in the SDSS. The predicted

cosmological simulations for the growth of dark matter halos, coupled with
analytical recipes for the metal enrichment of their interstellar medium, we
show that pockets of metal-free gas exist at z~6 even under the assumption of
high efficiency in metal pollution via winds. A comoving metal-free halo
formation rate d^2n/dtdV > 10^{-9} Mpc^{-3}yr^{-1} is expected at z=6 for halos

However, this result conflicts with observations of extremely-metal poor (EMP)

incompatible with those expected from very massive Population III progenitors.
We propose a new solution to the problem in which the IMF of second-generation
stars formed at z>10, before reionization, is deficient in sub-solar mass
stars, owing to the high cosmic microwave background temperature floor. The
observed EMP stars are formed preferentially at z<10 in pockets of gas enriched
to metallicity Z>10^{-3.5} Zsun by winds from Population II stars. Our
cosmological simulations of dark matter halos like the Milky Way show that
current samples of EMP stars can only constrain the IMF of late-time Population
III stars, formed at z<13 in halos with virial temperature Tvir~10^4 K. This
suggests that pair instability supernovae were not produced primarily by this
population. To begin probing the IMF of Population III stars formed at higher

In our model, the agents, in addition to changing their opinions due to
influence of the rest of society and external propaganda, have the ability to
modify their social network, forming links with agents sharing the same
opinions and cutting the links with those they disagree with. To improve the
model further we divide the agents into `fanatics' and `opportunists',
depending on how easy is to change their opinions. The simulations show
significant differences compared to traditional models, where network links are
static. In particular, for the dynamical model where inter-agent links are
adjustable, the final network structure and opinion distribution is shown to
resemble real world observations, such as social structures and persistence of
minority groups even when most of the society is against them and the

principal effect of the HBI is to re-orient field lines to be perpendicular to
the temperature gradient. Once the field has been wrapped up onto spherical
surfaces surrounding the core, the core is insulated from further conductive
heating (with the effective thermal conduction suppressed to less than 1/100th

cluster for 10 Myr. The mass of the IMBH is assigned one of four values from
400 Msun to 4000 Msun, and its initial semi-major axis with respect to the SMBH
is varied from 0.3-30 mpc, bracketing the radii at which inspiral of the IMBH
is expected to stall. We consider two values for the eccentricity of the
IMBH/SMBH binary, e=(0,0.7), and 12 values for the orientation of the binary's
plane. Changes at the level of 1% in the orbital elements of the S-stars could
occur in just a few years if the IMBH is sufficiently massive. On time scales
of 1 Myr or longer, the IMBH efficiently randomizes the eccentricities and
orbital inclinations of the S-stars. Kozai oscillations are observed when the
IMBH lies well outside the orbits of the stars. Perturbations from the IMBH can
eject stars from the cluster, producing hypervelocity stars, and can also
scatter stars into the SMBH; stars with high initial eccentricities are most
likely to be affected in both cases. The distribution of S-star orbital
elements is significantly altered from its currently-observed form by IMBHs
with masses greater than 1000 Msun if the IMBH/SMBH semi-major axis lies in the

uncertain processes appear to play critical roles in generating the column
densities of warm water that are detected from disks at infrared wavelengths.
The dominant factors are the reactions that form molecular hydrogen, including
formation on warm grains, and the ionization and heating of the atmosphere. All
of these can work together to produce a region of high water abundances in the
molecular transition layer of the inner disk atmosphere, where atoms are
transformed into molecules, the temperature drops from thousands to hundreds of
Kelvins, and the ionization begins to be dominated by the heavy elements. Grain
formation of molecular hydrogen and mechanical heating of the atmosphere can
play important roles in this region and directly affect the amount of warm
water in protoplanetary disk atmospheres. Thus it may be possible to account
for the existing measurements of water emission from Tauri disks without
invoking transport of water from cooler to warmer regions. The hydroxyl radical
OH is under-abundant in this model of disk atmospheres and requires
consideration of additional production and excitation processes.

observed low-redshift relation. A sample of 29,000 early-type galaxies selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 shows that the bright end of
the CMR has a shallower slope and smaller scatter than the faint end. This
magnitude dependence is predicted by a simple toy model in which gas-rich
mergers move galaxies onto a ""creation red sequence"" (CRS) by quenching their
star formation, and subsequent mergers between red, gas-poor galaxies
(so-called ""dry"" mergers) move galaxies along the relation. We use galaxy
merger trees from a semianalytic model of galaxy formation to test the
amplitude of this effect and find a change in slope at the bright end that
brackets the observations, using gas fraction thresholds of 10-30% to separate
wet and dry mergers. A more realistic model that includes scatter in the CRS
shows that dry merging decreases the scatter at the bright end. Contrary to
previous claims, the small scatter in the observed CMR thus cannot be used to
constrain the amount of dry merging.

momentum of a spinor field is encoded in the gravitational field at asymptotic
infinity. The inclusion of internal spin requires us to re-analyze our notion
of asymptotic flatness. In particular, the Poincar\'{e} symmetry at asymptotic
infinity must replaced by a spin-enlarged Poincar\'{e} symmetry. Likewise, the
generators of the asymptotic symmetry group must be supplemented to account for
the internal spin. In the Hamiltonian framework of first order Einstein-Cartan
gravity, the extra generator comes from the boundary term of the Gauss
constraint in the asymptotically flat context. With the additional term, we
establish the relations among the Noether charges of a Dirac field, the Komar
integral, and the asymptotic ADM-like geometric integral. We show that by
imposing mild restraints on the generating functionals of gauge transformations
at asymptotic infinity, the phase space is rendered explicitly finite. We
construct the energy-momentum and the new total (spin+orbital) angular momentum
boundary integrals that satisfy the appropriate algebra to be the generators of
the spin-enlarged Poincar\'{e} symmetry. This demonstrates that the internal
spin is encoded in the tetrad at asymptotic infinity. In addition, we find that

This effective geometry is intrinsically quantum in origin, and its signature

effective field theory arising from our condensed matter system we encounter
explicit anisotropic scaling in time and space. Here Lorentz symmetry is an

order. The emerging theory has the similar structure to the four dimensional
SU(N) gauge theory in the large N limit. Because of strong quantum fluctuations
caused by the abundant low energy excitations near the Fermi surface, low
energy fermions remain strongly coupled even in the large N limit. As a result,
there are infinitely many quantum corrections that contribute to the leading
frequency dependence of the Green's function of fermion on the Fermi surface.

The planar dual of a finite squaregraph is determined by a triangle-free chord
diagram of the unit disk, which could alternatively be viewed as a
triangle-free line arrangement in the hyperbolic plane. This representation
carries over to infinite plane graphs with finite vertex degrees in which the
balls are finite squaregraphs. Algebraically, finite squaregraphs are median
graphs for which the duals are finite circular split systems. Hence
squaregraphs are at the crosspoint of two dualities, an algebraic and a
geometric one, and thus lend themselves to several combinatorial
interpretations and structural characterizations. With these and the
5-colorability theorem for circle graphs at hand, we prove that every
squaregraph can be isometrically embedded into the Cartesian product of five
trees. This embedding result can also be extended to the infinite case without
reference to an embedding in the plane and without any cardinality restriction
when formulated for median graphs free of cubes and further finite
obstructions. Further, we exhibit a class of squaregraphs that can be embedded
into the product of three trees and we characterize those squaregraphs that are
embeddable into the product of just two trees. Finally, finite squaregraphs
enjoy a number of algorithmic features that do not extend to arbitrary median
graphs. For instance, we show that median-generating sets of finite
squaregraphs can be computed in polynomial time, whereas, not unexpectedly, the

introduce some biases in the Baade-Wesselink (hereafter BW) methods of
determining the distance of Cepheids. In addition, it might affect the average
value of the radial velocity curve (or gamma-velocity) important for Galactic

(hereafter Pp) appropriate to be used together with the CC method. Moreover, we
investigate whether the CC method can explain the misunderstood previous
calculation of the K-term of Cepheids. We observed eight galactic Cepheids with
the HARPS spectrograph. For each star, we derive an interpolated CC radial
velocity curve using the HARPS pipeline. The amplitudes of these curves are
used to determine the correction to be applied to the semi-theoretical
projection factor derived in Nardetto et al. (2007). Their average value (or
gamma-velocity) are also compared to the center-of-mass velocities derived in
Nardetto et al. (2008). The correction in amplitudes allows us to derive a new
Pp relation: p = [-0.08+-0.05] log P +[1.31+-0.06]. We also find a negligible
wavelength dependence (over the optical range) of the Pp relation. We finally
show that the gamma-velocity derived from the CC method is systematically
blue-shifted by about 1.0 +- 0.2km/s compared to the center-of-mass velocity of
the star. An additional blue-shift of 1.0km/s is thus needed to totally explain
the previous calculation of the K-term of Cepheids (around 2km/s). The new Pp

intersymbol interference (ISI). First of all, we investigate the outage
probability and the outage-based power loss of the MIMO-ISI ARQ channel when
optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) turbo packet combining is used at the
receiver. We show that the ARQ delay (i.e., the maximum number of ARQ rounds)
does not completely translate into a diversity gain. We then introduce two
efficient turbo packet combining algorithms that are inspired by minimum mean
square error (MMSE)-based turbo equalization techniques. Both schemes can be
viewed as low-complexity versions of the optimal MAP turbo combiner. The first
scheme is called signal-level turbo combining and performs packet combining and
multiple transmission ISI cancellation jointly at the signal-level. The second
scheme, called symbol-level turbo combining, allows ARQ rounds to be separately
turbo equalized, while combining is performed at the filter output. We conduct
a complexity analysis where we demonstrate that both algorithms have almost the
same computational cost as the conventional log-likelihood ratio (LLR)-level
combiner. Simulation results show that both proposed techniques outperform
LLR-level combining, while for some representative MIMO configurations,
signal-level combining has better ISI cancellation capability and achievable
diversity order than that of symbol-level combining.

statistical consistency of such model-based inference requires that the model

  Here we prove that parameters for several such models, with finite state

identifiability of the numerical parameters. The method of proof involves first
inferring a full distribution of both parsimony-informative and non-informative

phylogenetic invariants. The failure of identifiability of the tree parameter

frame of the brane to the frame where the brane is moving. We confirm that this
simple method provides the same third- and fourth- order actions at leading
order in slow-roll and in the small sound speed limit as those obtained by the
usual ADM formalism. As an application, we compute the leading order connected
four-point function of the primordial curvature perturbation coming from the
intrinsic fourth-order contact interaction in the multi-field DBI-inflation
model. At the third order, the interaction Hamiltonian arises purely by the
boost from the second-order action in the rest frame of the brane. The boost
acts on the adiabatic and entropy modes in the same way thus there exists a
symmetry between the adiabatic and entropy modes. But at fourth order this
symmetry is broken due to the intrinsic fourth-order action in the rest frame
and the difference between the Lagrangian and the interaction Hamiltonian.
Therefore, contrary to the three-point function, the momentum dependence of the
purely adiabatic component and the components including the entropic
contributions are different in the four-point function. This suggests that the
trispectrum can distinguish the multi-field DBI-inflation model from the single
field DBI-inflation model.

Gamma-ray Space Telescope of high-energy gamma-ray emission from the peculiar
quasar PMN J0948+0022 (z=0.5846). The optical spectrum of this object exhibits
rather narrow Hbeta (FWHM(Hbeta) ~ 1500 km s^-1), weak forbidden lines and is
therefore classified as a narrow-line type I quasar. This class of objects is
thought to have relatively small black hole mass and to accrete at high
Eddington ratio. The radio loudness and variability of the compact radio core
indicates the presence of a relativistic jet. Quasi simultaneous
radio-optical-X-ray and gamma-ray observations are presented. Both radio and
gamma-ray emission (observed over 5-months) are strongly variable. The
simultaneous optical and X-ray data from Swift show a blue continuum attributed
to the accretion disk and a hard X-ray spectrum attributed to the jet. The
resulting broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) and, in particular, the
gamma-ray spectrum measured by Fermi are similar to those of more powerful
FSRQ. A comparison of the radio and gamma-ray characteristics of PMN J0948+0022
with the other blazars detected by LAT shows that this source has a relatively
low radio and gamma-ray power, with respect to other FSRQ. The physical
parameters obtained from modelling the SED also fall at the low power end of
the FSRQ parameter region discussed in Celotti & Ghisellini (2008). We suggest
that the similarity of the SED of PMN J0948+0022 to that of more massive and
more powerful quasars can be understood in a scenario in which the SED
properties depend on the Eddington ratio rather than on the absolute power.

gravity effects could lead to departures from Special Relativity in the form of
a deformed Poincar\`e algebra. These proposals go generically under the name of
Doubly or Deformed Special Relativity (DSR). In this article we further explore
a recently proposed class of quantum field theories, involving noncanonically
commuting complex scalar fields, which have been shown to entail a DSR-like
symmetry. An open issue for such theories is whether the DSR-like symmetry has
to be taken as a physically relevant symmetry, or if in fact the ""true""
symmetries of the theory are just rotations and translations while boost
invariance has to be considered broken. We analyze here this issue by extending
the known results to curved spacetime under both of the previous assumptions.
We show that if the symmetry of the free theory is taken to be a DSR-like
realization of the Poincar\'e symmetry, then it is not possible to render such
a symmetry a gauge symmetry of the curved physical spacetime. However, it is
possible to introduce an auxiliary spacetime which allows to describe the
theory as a standard quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Alternatively,
taking the point of view that the noncanonical commutation of the fields
actually implies a breakdown of boost invariance, the physical spacetime
manifold has to be foliated in surfaces of simultaneity and the field theory
can be coupled to gravity by making use of the ADM prescription.

of gas and dust. At some point during the collapse, a disk is formed around the
protostar and the disk will spin up and grow in size as the core contracts
because of angular momentum conservation. The question is how early the disk
formation process occurs. In this paper we aim to characterize the kinematical
state of a deeply embedded, Class 0 young stellar object, NGC1333-IRAS2A, based
on high angular resolution (< 1$''$ $\approx$ 200 AU) interferometric
observations of HCN and H$^{13}$CN J = 4-3 from the Submillimeter Array, and
test whether a circumstellar disk can be detected based on gas kinematic
features. We adopt a physical model which has been shown to describe the object
well and obtain a fit of a parameterized model of the velocity field, using a
two-dimensional axis-symmetric radiation transfer code. The parameterization
and fit to the high angular resolution data characterize the central dynamical
mass and the ratio of infall velocity to rotation velocity. We find a large
amount of infall and very little rotation on all scales. The central object has
a relatively low mass of 0.25 M$_\odot$ . As an object with a low stellar mass
compared to the envelope mass, we conclude that NGC1333-IRAS2A is consistent
with the suggestion that, as a Class 0 object, it represents the earliest
stages of star formation. The large amount of infall relative to rotation also
suggests that this is a young object. We do however find the need of a central
compact component on scales of a few hundred AU based on the continuum data,
which suggests that disk formation happens shortly after the initial
gravitational collapse. The data do not reveal a distinct velocity field for
this 0.1 M$_\odot$ component.

We find a ""break"" in the pure exponential stellar surface brightness profile,
and trace its origin to a sharp decrease in the star formation per unit surface
area, itself produced by a decrease in the gas volume density due to a warping
of the gas disc. Star formation in the disc continues well beyond the break. We
find that the break is more pronounced in bluer wavebands. By contrast, we find
little or no break in the mass density profile. This is, in part, due to the
net radial migration of stars towards the external parts of the disc. Beyond
the break radius, we find that ~60% of the resident stars migrated from the
inner disc, while ~25% formed in situ. Our simulated galaxy also has a minimum
in the age profile at the break radius but, in disagreement with some previous
studies, migration is not the main mechanism producing this shape. In our
simulation, the disc metallicity gradient flattens with time, consistent with
an ""inside-out"" formation scenario. We do not find any difference in the
intensity or the position of the break with inclination, suggesting that
perhaps the differences found in empirical studies are driven by dust
extinction.

investigated. Nonlinear finite element analyses of model concrete and mortar
specimens were performed. The aggregate diameter was varied between 2 and 16
mm. Furthermore, a range of volume fractions between 0.1 and 0.5 was studied.
The nonlinear analyses were based on a 2D lattice approach in which aggregates
were simplified as monosized cylindrical inclusions. The analysis results were
interpreted by means of crack width and change of permeability. The results
show that increasing aggregate diameter (at equal volume fraction) and
decreasing volume fraction (at equal aggregate diameter) greatly increases
permeability.

different methods exist to this purpose. The best of them are based on
approximate Maximum Likelihood estimators, assuming to know the number of

As the problem can be severely ill posed, a stochastic perturbation method is
proposed which provides better results than Maximum Likelihood based methods
when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. The method depends on some

a class of materials (like clathrates), which are crystalline compounds with
closed cavities in their structures. In the spirit of a minimalist approach,
our model includes only the minimum of ingredients necessary to capture the
generic features of this class of compounds as brought to light by experiments.
We consider only two kinds of particles: strongly coupled host atoms, which
form the structural cavities, and guest atoms confined in the cavities. In
spite of the confinement, for relatively small amplitude vibrations of the
guest atoms, their interaction with the host particles is assumed to be weaker
than between the host atoms. We calculate self-consistently the vibrational
mode (phonon) line broadenings for the empty and filled (by the guest atoms)
cavities. We show that the soft phonon dispersion sheet, which appears for
weakly bonded guest atoms, yields to large mode broadening via three waves
anharmonic mode coupling. In turn the Umklapp part of this broadening reduces
drastically the phonon thermoconductivity coefficient. We conclude that for a
system with a soft mode component in the vibrational spectrum phonon broadening
is always larger and thermal conductivity is always appreciably smaller than
for a system without this soft mode (provided all other characteristics are the
same). Although our model is minimal, in the sense of ignoring the complexity
of actual guest-host structures, when properly interpreted, it can yield quite
reasonable values for a variety of measurable quantities.

that these parameters underestimate the metallicity at low N/O ratios and
viceversa. We investigate also the effect of the N/O ratio on different

strong-line methods sensitive to the N/O abundance ratio, like N2O2 and N2S2,
we investigate the relation between this ratio and the stellar mass for the

the nova was at its maximum light. The evolution of the spectra are shown from
the initial P-Cygni phase to an emission-line phase and finally to a dust
formation stage. The characteristics of the JHK spectra are very similar to
those observed in a nova outburst occurring on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. We
analyse an observed line at 2.088 micron and suggest it could be due to FeII
excited by Lyman alpha fluorescence. The highlight of the observations is the
detection of the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide (CO) in the 2.29 -
2.40 micron region. The CO bands are modeled to estimate the temperature and
mass of the emitting CO gas and also to place limits on the 12C/13C ratio. The
CO bands are recorded over several epochs thereby allowing a rare opportunity
to study its evolution from a phase of constant strength through a stage when
the CO is destroyed fairly rapidly. We compare the observed timescales involved
in the evolution of the CO emission and find a good agreement with model

a discrete dense spectrum, whereas the environment reservoir states form a

exact analytical solution of the quantum dynamic equations. System reservoirs
couplings yield to spontaneous decay of the states, whereas system-reservoir
exchange leads to recurrence cycles and Loschmidt echo and double resonances at
the interlevel reservoir transitions. Due to these couplings the system $S$
time evolution is not reduced to a simple exponential relaxation. We predict
various regimes of the system dynamics, ranging from exponential decay to
irregular damped oscillations. Namely, we show that there are four possible
dynamic regimes of the evolution: (i) - independent of the environment
exponential decay suppressing backward transitions, (ii) Loschmidt echo regime,
(iii) - incoherent dynamics with multicomponent Loschmidt echo, when the system
state exchanges its energy with many states of the reservoir, (iv) - cycle
mixing regime, when the long term system dynamics appear to be random. We

however necessarily depend on the spatial discretization. At fine spatial

superconductors, drastic deviations from the Fermi liquid picture obtain,
highlighted by a pseudogap, broad spectral features and $T-$ linear
resistivity. This article focuses on the series of experiments on the
copper-oxide superconductors which reveal that the number of low-energy
addition states per electron per spin exceeds unity, in direct violation of the
key Fermi liquid tenet. These experiments point to new degrees of freedom, not
made out of the elemental excitations, as the key mechanism by which Fermi
liquid theory breaks down in the cuprates. A recent theoretical advance which
permits an explicit integration of the high energy scale in the standard model
for the cuprates reveals the source of the new dynamical degrees of freedom at
low energies, a charge 2e bosonic field which has nothing to do with pairing
but rather represents the mixing with the high energy scales. We demonstrate
explicitly that at half-filling, this new degree of freedom provides a
dynamical mechanism for the generation of the charge gap, antiferromagnetism in

part of condensed matter physics. Concepts developed in this field also occur
in the study of spacetime singularities, namely: i)- the topological theory of
quantized defects (Kibble's cosmic strings) and ii)- the Volterra process for
continuous defects, used to classify the Poincar\'e symmetry breakings. We
reassess the classification of Minkowski spacetime defects in the same
theoretical frame, starting from the conjecture that these defects fall into
two classes, as on they relate to massive particles or to radiation. This we
justify on the empirical evidence of the Hubble's expansion. We introduce
timelike and null congruences of geodesics treated as ordered media, viz.
'm'-crystals of massive particles and 'r'-crystals of massless particles, with
parallel 4-momenta in M^4. Classifying their defects (or 'forms') we find (i)
'm'- and 'r'- Volterra continuous line defects and (ii) quantized topologically
stable 'r'-defects, these latter forms being of various dimensionalities.
Besides these 'perfect' forms, there are 'imperfect' disclinations that bound
misorientation walls in three dimensions. We also speculate on the possible
relation of these forms with the large-scale structure of the Universe.

thoroughly the finite-size effects, finding that the lack of stationary state

early-type galaxies. It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its
morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas
supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas
disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to
bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for
instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ)
using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural
occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique.
We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient
to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy
red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk
stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the
absence of bound star-forming clumps. While gas stripping processes are limited
to dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like AGN feedback,
virial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos more
massive than 10^12 Mo, the MQ can explain the appearance of red ellipticals
even in less massive halos and in the field. The dense gas disks observed in
some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas
red galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at high
redshift.

external medium, that lowers the threshold of individual excitable units. We
address this problem by studying simplified excitable units given by a modified
FitzHugh-Nagumo dynamics. In our model neurons interact only chemically via the
released and diffusing potassium in the surrounding non-active medium. We study
the dynamics of a single excitable unit embedded in the extracellular matter.

high-precision current meter for measuring ultra-low currents, with resolution
several orders of magnitude better than that of conventional current meters.
  In addition to measuring the average current, the counting procedure also
makes it possible to investigate correlations between charge carriers. In
quantum dots, we find that the strong Coulomb interaction makes electrons try
to avoid each other. This leads to electron anti-bunching, giving stronger
correlations and reduced noise compared to a current carried by statistically
independent electrons.
  The charge detector is implemented by monitoring changes in conductance in a
near-by capacitively coupled quantum point contact. We find that the quantum
point contact not only serves as a detector but also causes a back-action onto
the measured device. Electron scattering in the quantum point contact leads to
emission of microwave radiation. The radiation is found to induce an electronic
transition between two quantum dots, similar to the absorption of light in real
atoms and molecules. Using a charge detector to probe the electron transitions,
we can relate a single-electron tunneling event to the absorption of a single
photon. Moreover, since the energy levels of the double quantum dot can be
tuned by external gate voltages, we use the device as a frequency-selective
single-photon detector operating at microwave energies.

spectrum of the crossed product is homeomorphic, via an induction map, to a
quotient of the spectrum of the crossed product by the stabilizer group bundle.
The main theorem is also generalized in the groupoid algebra case to an
identification of the primitive ideal space. This generalization replaces the
assumption that the orbit space is well behaved with an amenability hypothesis.
We then use induction to show that the primitive ideal space of the groupoid
algebra is homeomorphic to a quotient of the dual of the stabilizer group
bundle. In both cases the identification is topological. We then apply these
theorems in a number of examples, and examine when a groupoid algebra has
Hausdorff spectrum. As a separate result, we also develop a theory of principal
groupoid group bundles and locally unitary groupoid actions. We prove that such
actions are characterized, up to exterior equivalence, by a cohomology class

increasing their orbits during acceleration. This field also leads to a less
asymmetrical abundances of ejected protons towards the midplane in comparison
with the TP approach. For a given magnetic topology electrons in PIC
simulations are ejected to the same semispace as protons, contrary to the TP
results. This happens because the polarisation field extends far beyond the
thickness of a current sheet. This field decelerates the electrons, which are
initially ejected into the semispace opposite to the protons, returns them back
to the RCS, and, eventually, leads to the electron ejection into the same
semispace as protons. Energy distribution of the ejected electrons is rather
wide and single-peak, contrary to the two-peak narrow-energy distribution
obtained in the TP approach. In the case of a strong guiding field, the mean
energy of the ejected electrons is found to be smaller than it is predicted
analytically and by the TP simulations.

  Zakopane. Poland","Acta Phys.Polon.Supp.2:215,2009",,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We briefly review how light meson resonances are described within one and
two-loop Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory amplitudes and how, close to
Nc=3, light vectors follow the Nc behavior of $q\bar q$ mesons whereas light
scalars do not. This supports the hypothesis that the lightest scalar is not
predominantly a $q\bar q$ meson, although a subdominant $q\bar q$ component is
suggested around 1 GeV at somewhat larger Nc. In contrast, when Nc is very far
from 3, like in the Nc --> infinity limit, we explain again in detail why
unitarization is not, a priori, reliable nor robust and why this limit should
not be used to drag any conclusions about the dominant nature of physical light
scalar mesons.

systems. Such systems, synchronous or not, use clocks and timeouts. Therefore
the magnitudes of elapsed absolute time in the system need to satisfy the axiom
of Archimedes. Under this restriction of asynchronicity logically
time-independent solutions can be derived which are nonetheless better (in
number of message passes) than is possible otherwise. The use of clocks by the
individual processors, in elections in a ring of asynchronous processors
without central control, allows a deterministic solution which requires but a
linear number of message passes. To obtain the result it has to be assumed that
the clocks measure finitely proportional absolute time-spans for their time
units, that is, the magnitudes of elapsed time in the ring network satisfy the
axiom of Archimedes. As a result, some basic subtilities associated with
distributed computations are highlighted. For instance, the known nonlinear
lower bound on the required number of message passes is cracked. For the
synchronous case, in which the necessary assumptions hold a fortiori, the
method is -asymptotically- the most efficient one yet, and of optimal order of
magnitude. The deterministic algorithm is of -asymptotically- optimal bit
complexity, and, in the synchronous case, also yields an optimal method to
determine the ring size. All of these results improve the known ones.
