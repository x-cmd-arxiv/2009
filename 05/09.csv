observations of anomalous cosmic rays by Voyager 1 and 2. The model appeals to
fast magnetic reconnection rather than shocks as the driver of acceleration.
The ultimate source of energy is associated with magnetic field reversals that
occur in the heliosheath. It is expected that the magnetic field reversals will
occur throughout the heliosheath, but especially near the heliopause where the
flows slows down and diverge in respect to the interstellar wind and also in
the boundary sector-in the heliospheric current sheet. While the First Order
Fermi acceleration theory within reconnection layers is in its infancy, the
available predictions do not contradict the available data on anomalous cosmic
ray spectra measured by the spacecrafts. We argue that the Voyager data can be
one of the first pieces of evidence favoring the acceleration within regions of
fast magnetic reconnection, which we argue is a widely spread astrophysical
process.

particle (NLSP) is discussed and it is shown that this situation arises in
nonuniversal SUGRA models within a significant part of the parameter space
compatible with all known experimental bounds. It is then shown that the gluino
NLSP (GNLSP) models lead to a compressed sfermion spectrum with the sleptons
often heavier than the squarks at least for the first two generations. The
relic density here is governed by gluino coannihilation which is responsible
for a relatively small mass splitting between the gluino and the neutralino
masses. Thus the GNLSP class of models is very predictive first because the
SUSY production cross sections at the LHC are dominated by gluino production
and second because the gluino production itself proceeds dominantly through a
single channel which allows for a direct determination of the gluino mass and
an indirect determination of the neutralino mass due to a linear relation
between these two masses which is highly constrained by coannihilation. A
detailed analysis of these models shows that the jet production and tagged
b-jets from the gluino production can be discriminated from the standard model
background with appropriate cuts. It is found that the GNLSP models can be
tested with just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and may therefore be
checked with low luminosity runs in the first data at the LHC. Thus if a GNLSP
model is realized, the LHC will turn into a gluino factory through a profuse
production of gluinos with typically only a small fraction $\lesssim 5%$ of
total SUSY events arising from other production modes over the allowed GNLSP
model parameter space.

network of dissipative harmonic oscillators. We consider ideal sender and
receiver oscillators connected by a chain of nonideal transmitter oscillators
coupled by nearest-neighbor resonances. From the algebraic properties of the
dynamical quantities describing the evolution of the network state, we derive a
criterion, fixing the coupling strengths between all the oscillators, apart
from their natural frequencies, enabling perfect state transfer in the
particular case of ideal transmitter oscillators. Our criterion provides an
easily manipulated formula enabling perfect state transfer in the special case
where the network nonidealities are disregarded. By adjusting the common
frequency of the sender and the receiver oscillators to be out of resonance
with that of the transmitters, we demonstrate that the sender's state tunnels
to the receiver oscillator by virtually exciting the nonideal transmitter
chain. This virtual process makes negligible the decay rate associated with the
transmitter line on the expenses of delaying the time interval for the state
transfer process. Apart from our analytical results, numerical computations are
presented to illustrate our protocol.

scales as <x^2> ~t^(1/2), to normal Fickian diffusion, where <x^2>~t$, is
studied as a function of channel width for colloidal particles.
  By comparing Brownian dynamics to a hybrid molecular dynamics and mesoscopic
simulation technique, we can study the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on
the single file mobility and on the crossover to Fickian diffusion for wider
channel widths. For disc-like particles with a steep interparticle repulsion,
the single file mobilities for different particle densities are well described
by the exactly solvable hard-rod model. This holds both for simulations that
include hydrodynamics, as well as for those that don't. When the single file
constraint is lifted, then for particles of diameter \sigma and pipe of width
$L$ such that (L- 2 \sigma)/\sigma = \delta_c << 1 the particles can be
described as hopping past one-another in an average time t_{hop}. For shorter
times t << t_{hop} the particles still exhibit sub-diffusive behaviour, but at
longer times t > t_{hop}, normal Fickian diffusion sets in with an effective
diffusion constant D_{hop} ~ t_{hop}^(1/2). For the Brownian particles, t_{hop}
~ 1/\delta_c^(2) when \delta << 1, but when hydrodynamic interactions are
included, we find a stronger dependence than \delta_c^{-2}. We attribute this
difference to short-range lubrication forces that make it more difficult for
particles to hop past each other in very narrow channels.

geometrically thin disk with a density in the equatorial plane that drops as a
power law of distance from the star. It is usually assumed that the vertical
structure of such a disk (in the direction parallel to the stellar rotation
axis) is governed by the hydrostatic equilibrium set by the vertical component
of the star's gravitational acceleration. Previous radiative equilibrium models
for such disks have usually been computed assuming a fixed density structure.
This introduces an inconsistency as the gas density is not allowed to respond
to temperature changes and the resultant disk model is not in vertical,
hydrostatic equilibrium. In this work, we modify the {\sc bedisk} code of
\citet{sig07} so that it enforces a hydrostatic equilibrium consistent with the
temperature solution. We compare the disk densities, temperatures, H$\alpha$
line profiles, and near-IR excesses predicted by such models with those
computed from models with a fixed density structure. We find that the fixed
models can differ substantially from the consistent hydrostatic models when the
disk density is high enough that the circumstellar disk develops a cool
($T\lesssim10,000 $K) equatorial region close to the parent star. Based on
these new hydrostatic disks, we also predict an approximate relation between
the (global) density-averaged disk temperature and the $T_{\rm eff}$ of the
central star, covering the full range of central Be star spectral types.

  in RF and Optical Wireless Communications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution has recently attracted the interest within
the research community due to its involvement in various communication systems.
In the context of RF wireless communications, GG distribution accurately models
the power statistics in composite shadowing/fading channels as well as in
cascade multipath fading channels, while in optical wireless (OW) systems, it
describes the fluctuations of the irradiance of optical signals distorted by
atmospheric turbulence. Although GG channel model offers analytical
tractability in the analysis of single input single output (SISO) wireless
systems, difficulties arise when studying multiple input multiple output (MIMO)
systems, where the distribution of the sum of independent GG variates is
required. In this paper, we present a novel simple closed-form approximation
for the distribution of the sum of independent, but not necessarily identically
distributed GG variates. It is shown that the probability density function
(PDF) of the GG sum can be efficiently approximated either by the PDF of a
single GG distribution, or by a finite weighted sum of PDFs of GG
distributions. To reveal the importance of the proposed approximation, the
performance of RF wireless systems in the presence of composite fading, as well
as MIMO OW systems impaired by atmospheric turbulence, are investigated.
Numerical results and simulations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed
approach.

synthesized by pulsed laser ablation on single crystal (100) yttria-stabilized
zirconia (YSZ) substrates to investigate the mechanism of magneto-transport in
a granular manganite. Different degrees of granularity is achieved by using the
deposition temperature (T$_{D}$) of 700 and 800 $^{0}$C. Although no
significant change in magnetic order temperature (T$_C$) and saturation
magnetization is seen for these two types of films, the temperature and
magnetic field dependence of their resistivity ($\rho$(T, H)) is strikingly
dissimilar. While the $\rho$(T,H) of the 800 $^{0}$C film is comparable to that
of epitaxial samples, the lower growth temperature leads to a material which
undergoes insulator-to-metal transition at a temperature (T$_{P}$ $\approx$ 170
K) much lower than T$_C$. At T $\ll$ T$_P$, the resistivity is characterized by
a minimum followed by ln $\emph{T}$ divergence at still lower temperatures. The
high negative magnetoresistance ($\approx$ 20$%$) and ln $\emph{T}$ dependence
below the minimum are explained on the basis of Kondo-type scattering from
blocked Mn-spins in the intergranular material. Further, a striking feature of
the T$_D$ = 700 $^{0}$C film is its two orders of magnitude larger anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) as compared to the AMR of epitaxial films. We attribute
it to unquenching of the orbital angular momentum of 3d electrons of Mn ions in
the intergranular region where crystal field is poorly defined.

Higgs portal-like couplings to the Standard Model are considered as a possible
explanation for recently observed cosmic ray excesses. Two versions of the
model are studied, one with non-thermal DM as the origin of the boost factor
and one with Sommerfeld enhancement. In the case of non-thermal DM, four hidden
sector scalars which transform under a U(1)_{X} symmetry are added. The
heaviest scalars decouple and later decay to DM scalars, so providing the boost
factor necessary to explain the present DM annihilation rate. The mass of the
annihilating scalars is limited to < 600 GeV for the model to remain
perturbative. U(1)_{X} breaking to Z_2 at the electroweak transition mixes
light O(100) MeV hidden sector scalars with the Higgs. The DM scalars
annihilate to these light scalars, which subsequently decay to two mu^{+}
mu^{-} pairs via Higgs mixing, so generating a positron excess without
antiprotons. Decay to \mu^{+}\mu^{-} rather than e^{+}e^{-} is necessary to
ensure a fast enough light scalar decay rate to evade light scalar domination
at nucleosynthesis. In the version with Sommerfeld enhancement only three new
scalars are necessary. TeV scale DM masses can be accomodated, allowing both
the higher energy electron plus positron excess and the lower energy PAMELA
positron excess to be explained. DM annihilates to two \mu^{+}\mu^{-} pairs as
in the non-thermal model. This annihilation mode may be favoured by recent
observations of the electron plus positron excess by FERMI and HESS.

the three invariants, energy, enstrophy and zonostrophy, will cascade
anisotropically into non-intersecting sectors in the $k$-space, so that the
energy cascade is ""pushed"" into the large-scale zonal scales. In the present
paper, we consider the scales much less than the Rossby deformation radius and
generalise the Fj{\o}rtoft argument of \cite{perm,BNZ_invariant} to find the
directions of the three cascades in this case. For the first time, we
demonstrate numerically that zonostrophy is well conserved by the CHM model,
and that the energy, enstrophy and zonostrophy cascade as prescribed by the
Fj{\o}rtoft argument if the nonlinearity is sufficiently weak. Moreover,
numerically we observe that zonostrophy is conserved surprisingly well at late

naturally explains the multi-phase nature of the gas and the kinematic
signatures of the absorption profiles. Although our preferred scenario suggests
that NeVIII may not be directly probing the warm-hot intergalactic medium, it
does imply the existence of an extended hot confining medium around a disk
galaxy that may contain a significant reservoir of baryons in the form of hot
gas.

counterparts in the Spitzer SAGE survey database, for which we present uniform
photometry from 0.3-24 microns in the UBVIJHKs+IRAC+MIPS24 bands. The resulting
infrared color-magnitude diagrams illustrate that the supergiant B[e], red
supergiant and luminous blue variable (LBV) stars are among the brightest
infrared point sources in the Large Magellanic Cloud, due to their intrinsic
brightness, and at longer wavelengths, due to dust. We detect infrared excesses
due to free-free emission among ~900 OB stars, which correlate with luminosity
class. We confirm the presence of dust around 10 supergiant B[e] stars, finding
the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to be very similar, in
contrast to the variety of SED shapes among the spectrally variable LBVs. The
similar luminosities of B[e] supergiants (log L/Lo>=4) and the rare, dusty
progenitors of the new class of optical transients (e.g. SN 2008S and NGC 300
OT), plus the fact that dust is present in both types of objects, suggests a
common origin for them. We find the infrared colors for Wolf-Rayet stars to be
independent of spectral type and their SEDs to be flatter than what models
predict. The results of this study provide the first comprehensive roadmap for
interpreting luminous, massive, resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies
at infrared wavelengths.

line holds in the exploration of the distant universe and modern observational
cosmology, the origin of the observed diversity of lya profiles remains to be
thoroughly explained. Observations of nearby star forming galaxies bring their
batch of apparent contradictions between Lya emission and their physical
parameters, and call for a detailed understanding of the physical processes at
work. IZw 18, one of the most metal-poor galaxies known is of particular
interest in this context.
  We use a 3D Lya radiation transfer code to model Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
observations of IZw 18 and to fit its Lya spectrum. Different geometrical
configurations of the source and the neutral gas are explored.
  The integrated Lya profile of NW region of IZw 18 is reproduced using the
observed small amount of dust (E(B-V) ~ 0.05) and a spherical HI shell with
N(HI) = 6.5 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). Such a high column density makes it possible to
transform a strong Lya emission (EW(Lya) = 60 A) into a damped absorption even
with a small extinction. When a slab geometry is applied and a given line of
sight is chosen, the Lya profile can be successfully reproduced with no dust at
all and N(HI) = 3 x 10^(21) cm^(-2). The spatial variations of the profile
shape are naturally explained by radiation transfer effects. In the case of
outflowing Inter Stellar Medium (ISM), as commonly observed in Lyman Break
Galaxies (LBGs), a high N(H) and dust content are required to observe Lya in
absorption. For nearly static neutral gas as observed in IZw 18 and other low
luminosity galaxies only a small amount of dust is required provided a
sufficiently high N(H) covers the galaxy.

the Landau gauge result via a Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation. This
transformation can be written in a practically useful form in both
configuration and momentum space. It is therefore possible to anticipate
effects of a gauge transformation on the propagator's analytic properties.
These facts enable one to establish that if a critical number of flavours for
chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement exists in noncompact QED3, then
its value is independent of the gauge parameter. This is explicated using
simple forms for the fermion-photon vertex and the photon vacuum polarisation.
The illustration highlights pitfalls that must be avoided in order to arrive at
valid conclusions. Landau gauge is seen to be the covariant gauge in which the
propagator avoids modification by a non-dynamical gauge-dependent exponential

spaces are well known in generalized rough set theory. However, these studies
may be said to have been confined to particular perspectives of
distinguishability in the context. In this research, the essence of an
algebraic semantics that can deal with all possible concepts of
distinguishability over similarity spaces is progressed. Key to this is the
addition of choice-related operations to the semantics that have connections
with modal logics as well. Among these we focus on a semantics that is based on
local clear distinguishability over similarity spaces.

magnetic activity common to warmer solar-like stars change into the brown-dwarf
domain: the surface magnetic field becomes more dipolar and the evolution of
the field patterns slows, the photospheric plasma is increasingly neutral and
decoupled from the magnetic field, chromospheric and coronal emissions weaken
markedly, and the efficiency of rotational braking rapidly decreases. Yet,
radio emission persists, and has been argued to be dominated by
electron-cyclotron maser emission instead of the gyrosynchrotron emission from
warmer stars. These properties may signal a transition in the stellar extended
atmosphere. Stars warmer than about M5 have a solar-like corona and
wind-sustained heliosphere in which the atmospheric activity is powered by
convective motions that move the magnetic field. Stars cooler than early-L, in
contrast, may have a jovian-like rotation-dominated magnetosphere powered by
the star's rotation in a scaled-up analog of the magnetospheres of Jupiter and
Saturn. A dimensional scaling relationship for rotation-dominated
magnetospheres by Fan et al. (1982) is consistent with this hypothesis.

condensate surrounded by a strongly correlated thin shell of anisotropic
matter, have been proposed as an alternative to the standard black hole picture
of general relativity. Observationally distinguishing between astrophysical
black holes and gravastars is a major challenge for this latter theoretical
model. In the context of stationary and axially symmetrical geometries, a
possibility of distinguishing gravastars from black holes is through the
comparative study of thin accretion disks around rotating gravastars and
Kerr-type black holes, respectively. In the present paper, we consider
accretion disks around slowly rotating gravastars, with all the metric tensor
components estimated up to the second order in the angular velocity. Due to the
differences in the exterior geometry, the thermodynamic and electromagnetic
properties of the disks (energy flux, temperature distribution and equilibrium
radiation spectrum) are different for these two classes of compact objects,
consequently giving clear observational signatures. In addition to this, it is
also shown that the conversion efficiency of the accreting mass into radiation
is always smaller than the conversion efficiency for black holes, i.e.,
gravastars provide a less efficient mechanism for converting mass to radiation
than black holes. Thus, these observational signatures provide the possibility
of clearly distinguishing rotating gravastars from Kerr-type black holes.

can have a much higher Q factor, broader bandwidth, and are much less

found in metal nanowires. Contrary to surface plasmon resonances however, these
grazing resonances can be excited in both dielectric and metallic nanowires and

solving these equations are challenging due to the nonlinear stiff collision

penalize the nonlinear collision term by a BGK-type relaxation term, which can
be solved explicitly even if discretized implicitly in time. Moreover, the
BGK-type relaxation operator helps to drive the density distribution toward the
local Maxwellian, thus natually imposes an asymptotic-preserving scheme in the
Euler limit. The scheme so designed does not need any nonlinear iterative
solver or the use of Wild Sum. It is uniformly stable in terms of the (possibly
small) Knudsen number, and can capture the macroscopic fluid dynamic (Euler)
limit even if the small scale determined by the Knudsen number is not
numerically resolved. It is also consistent to the compressible Navier-Stokes
equations if the viscosity and heat conductivity are numerically resolved. The
method is applicable to many other related problems, such as hyperbolic systems

  and Parametric Studies","12 pages, 12 figures",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.80.125116",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coordinate-transformation approaches to invisibility cloaking rely on the
design of an anisotropic, spatially inhomogeneous ""transformation medium""
capable of suitably re-routing the energy flux around the region to conceal
without causing any scattering in the exterior region. It is well known that
the inherently magnetic properties of such medium limit the high-frequency
scaling of practical ""metamaterial"" implementations based on subwavelength
inclusions (e.g., split-ring resonators). Thus, for the optical range,
non-magnetic implementations, based on approximate reductions of the
constitutive parameters, have been proposed.
  In this paper, we present an alternative approach to non-magnetic
coordinate-transformation cloaking, based on the mapping from a
nearly-transparent, anisotropic and spatially inhomogeneous virtual domain. We
show that, unlike its counterparts in the literature, our approach is amenable
to exact analytic treatment, and that its overall performance is comparable to
that of a non-ideal (lossy, dispersive, parameter-truncated) implementation of
standard (magnetic) cloaking.

consider maps in some neighbourhood of $F_*$ and study their dynamics.

Anti-Salkowski curves in Minkowski space $\e_1^3$. Also, we characterize them
as space curve with constant curvature or constant torsion and whose normal
vector makes a constant angle with a fixed line.

and their organelles. Further, lipid composition and morphology can play a key
role in regulating a variety of biological processes. For example, viral
uptake, plasma membrane tension regulation, and the formation of caveolae all
require the creation and control of groups of lipids that adopt specific
morphologies. In this paper, we use a simplified model mixture of lipids and
cholesterol to examine the interplay between lipid phase-separation and bilayer
morphology. We observe and theoretically analyze three main features of
phase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles. First, by tracking the motion of
`dimpled' domains, we measure repulsive, elastic interactions that create
short--range translational and orientational order, leading to a stable
distribution of domain sizes, and hence maintaining lateral heterogeneity on
relatively short length scales and long time scales. Second, we examine the
transition to `budded' domain morphologies, showing that the transition is
size-selective, and has two kinetic regimes, as revealed by a calculated phase
diagram. Finally, using observations of the interactions between dimpled and
budded domains, we build a theoretical framework with an elastic model that
maps the free energies and allowed transitions in domain morphology upon
coalescence, to serve as an interpretive tool for understanding the algebra of
domain morphology. In all three cases, the two major factors that regulate
domain morphology and morphological transitions are the domain size and
membrane tension.

means of an example, how general couplings, i.e. couplings containing multiple
derivatives and/or higher spin fields, should be treated. We do this by
introducing and applying the Takahashi-Umezawa and the Gross-Jackiw method. For
practical purposes we introduce the $\bar{P}$ method. We also show how the
Takashashi-Umezawa method can be derived using the theory of Bogoliubov and
collaborators and the Gross-Jackiw method is also used to study the
$n$-dependence of the Kadyshevsky integral equation. Last but not least we
present the second quantization procedure of the quasi particle in Kadyshevsky
formalism.

states of biological systems are commonly used for dimensional reduction. Among
these models, pairwise models are very attractive in part because they can be
fit using a reasonable amount of data: knowledge of the means and correlations
between pairs of elements in the system is sufficient. Not surprisingly, then,
using pairwise models for studying neural data has been the focus of many
studies in recent years. In this paper, we describe how tools from statistical
physics can be employed for studying and using pairwise models. We build on our
previous work on the subject and study the relation between different methods
for fitting these models and evaluating their quality. In particular, using
data from simulated cortical networks we study how the quality of various
approximate methods for inferring the parameters in a pairwise model depends on
the time bin chosen for binning the data. We also study the effect of the size
of the time bin on the model quality itself, again using simulated data. We
show that using finer time bins increases the quality of the pairwise model. We
offer new ways of deriving the expressions reported in our previous work for
assessing the quality of pairwise models.

non-perturbative solution of invariant masses and correlated parton amplitudes

function representation, we obtain a large, sparse, Hamiltonian matrix for mass
eigenstates of gauge theories that is solvable by adapting the ab initio
no-core methods of nuclear many-body theory. Full covariance is recovered in
the continuum limit, the infinite matrix limit. There is considerable freedom
in the choice of the orthonormal and complete set of basis functions with
convenience and convergence rates providing key considerations. Here, we use a
two-dimensional harmonic oscillator basis for transverse modes that corresponds
with eigensolutions of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model obtained from light-front
holography. We outline our approach and present illustrative features of some
non-interacting systems in a cavity. We illustrate the first steps towards
solving QED by obtaining the mass eigenstates of an electron in a cavity in
small basis spaces and discuss the computational challenges.

modified by extinction at 8-22$\mu$, locally and overall. In Sgr B2 at $l >

cases, extinction from individual galactic center molecular clouds is shown to
have $\tau \ga 1$ at 8-22$\mu$ independent of wavelength. The gas kinematics
are mostly rotational but with systematic $\pm 30-50$ \kms non-circular motion.
Sgr B and C both show the same shell and high-velocity cap structure. The H II
regions lie in a slightly-inclined ring of radius $\approx$ 180 pc (1.2\degr)

B. Sgr C is on the far side and both Sgr B and C represent collisions with
material inflowing along the galactic dust lanes. Sgr E is a coincidental
aggregation of field objects seen tangent to the ring's outer edge. Most of the
volume interior to the ring is probably devoid of dense gas and some emission
seen at v=20-70 \kms toward Sgr A lies outside it, in the ring.
