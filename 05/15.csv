pairs at LHC through standard or new interactions. We study the production of
heavy lepton pairs in SM extensions with: (i) a Majorana or Dirac lepton
triplet, as those appearing in type-III seesaw; (ii) a lepton isodoublet
(N,E)_{L,R}; (iii) a charged isosinglet E_{L,R}; (iv) a Majorana or Dirac
neutrino singlet N and an additional Z' gauge boson. It is shown that the
trilepton final state l+-l+-l-+, which has a small SM background, constitutes
the golden channel for heavy neutrino searches, being very sensitive to
Majorana or Dirac neutrinos in triplet, doublet or singlet SU(2)_L
representations. For higher luminosities, signals in this final state can also
distinguish lepton triplets from doublets and singlets. The Majorana or Dirac
nature of the heavy neutrinos is revealed by the presence or not of like-sign
dilepton l+-l+- signals without significant missing energy. Notably, l+-l+-
signals but with large missing energy are characteristic of Dirac triplets,
distinguishing them from the other two models with a heavy Dirac neutrino.
Further discrimination is achieved with the analysis of the clean l+l+l-l-
final state.

degrees of freedom associated to their scale size and orientation. It has long
been conjectured that these degrees of freedom have a dual interpretation as
the positions of partonic constituents of the instanton. These conjectures are
usually framed in d=3+1 and d=1+1 dimensions respectively where the partons are
supposed to be responsible for confinement and other strong coupling phenomena.
We revisit this partonic interpretation of instantons in the context of d=4+1
and d=2+1 dimensions. Here the instantons are particle-like solitons and the
theories are non-renormalizable. We present an explicit and calculable model in
d=2+1 dimensions where the single soliton in the CP^N sigma-model can be shown
to be a multi-particle state whose partons are identified with the ultra-violet
degrees of freedom which render the theory well-defined at high energies. We
introduce a number of methods which reveal the partons inside the soliton,
including deforming the sigma model and a dual version of the Bogomolnyi
equations. We conjecture that partons inside Yang-Mills instantons hold the key
to understanding the ultra-violet completion of five-dimensional gauge
theories.

unified theories are naturally generated. As charged matter fields have
localized zero modes in F-theory, a study of flavor structure could be easier
in F-theory than in Heterotic string theory. In a study of flavor structure in
the lepton sector, however, an important role is played by right-handed
neutrinos, which are not charged under the SU(5) unified gauge group. It is
therefore solicited to find out what right-handed neutrinos are in F-theory
compactifications and how their Majorana mass terms are generated together with
developing a theoretical framework where effective Yukawa couplings involving
both SU(5)-neutral and charged fields can be calculated. We find that the
complex structure moduli chiral multiplets of F-theory compactifications are
good candidates to be right-handed neutrinos, and that their Majorana masses
are automatically generated in flux compactifications. The mass scale is
predicted to be somewhat below the GUT scale, which is in nice agreement with
the Delta m^2 of the atmospheric neutrino oscillation through the see-saw
mechanism. We also discuss various scenarios of solving the dimension-4 proton
decay problem in supersymmetric F-theory compactifications, along with
considering the consequences of those scenarios in the nature of right-handed

which they have investigated the behaviour of a two-planet system embedded in a
protoplanetary disc. They have put a Jupiter mass gas giant on the internal
orbit and a lower mass planet on the external one. We consider here a similar
problem taking into account a gas giant with masses in the range of 0.5 to 1
Jupiter mass and a Super-Earth as the outermost planet. By changing disc
parameters and planet masses we have succeeded in getting the convergent
migration which allows for the possibility of their resonant locking. However,
in the case in which the gas giant has the mass of Jupiter, before any mean
motion first order commensurability could be achieved, the Super-Earth is
caught in a trap when it is very close to the edge of the gap opened by the
giant planet. This confirms the result obtained by Pierens & Nelson (2008) in
their simulations. Additionally, we have found that, in a very thin disc, an
apsidal resonance is observed in the system if the Super-Earth is captured in
the trap. Moreover, the eccentricity of the small planet remains low, while
that of the gas giant increases slightly due to the imbalance between Lindblad
and corotational resonances. We have also studied analogous systems in which
the gas giant is allowed to take Sub-Jupiter masses. In this case, after
performing an extensive survey over all possible parameters, we have succeeded
in getting the 1:2 mean motion resonant configuration only in a disc with low
aspect ratio and low surface density. However, the resonance is maintained just
for few thousand orbits. Thus, we conclude that for typical protoplanetary
discs the mean motion commensurabilities are rare if the Super-Earth is located
on the external orbit relative to the gas giant. (abridged)

The mixed derivatives cause the presence of waves with opposite phase and group

is stable if the absorption function $\sigma$ lies below a specified threshold.

like torque strength for bar and spiral, and also the total nonaxisymmetric
torque. We explore the interplay between the spiral and bar components of
galaxies. Both the length and the contrast of the Fourier bars decrease along
the morphological sequence Sb-Sbc-Sc, with bars in earlier types being longer
and showing higher contrast. Bars of Sb galaxies are ~3x longer than bars in Sc
types. We find that longer bars are not necessarily stronger (as quantified by
the torque Q_{b} measure), but longer bars show a higher contrast, in very good
agreement with theoretical predictions. Our data suggests that bar and spiral
components are rather independent in the sense that the torque strengths of the
two components are not correlated. The total strength Q_{g} is a very reliable
tracer of the bar strength Q_{b}, the two quantities showing a very tight
linear correlation. Comparison with a similar sample of disk galaxies extracted
from the OSUBGS indicates that the isolated CIG/AMIGA galaxies host
significantly longer Fourier bars and possibly show a different distribution of
spiral torque Q_{s}. The Fourier analysis also revealed a potential case of
counterwinding spiral structure (NGC 5768), which deserves further kinematic
study. We find that m = 2 (i.e., dominating two-armed pattern) is the most

limit is neither needed nor invoked in deriving the solutions or in the

to constrain the parameters of the DGP model. As a first application of the
method, we find that whenever the 4D energy density is a pure cosmological

at four epochs. At our three epochs and the epoch of Zavala & Taylor (2003), we
observe transverse Rotation Measure (RM) gradients across the jet, consistent
with the presence of a helical magnetic field wrapped around the jet. However,
we also observe a ""flip"" in the direction of the gradient between June 2000 and
August 2002. Although the origins of this phenomena are not entirely clear,
possibly explanations include (i) the sense of rotation of the central
supermassive black hole and accretion disc has remained the same, but the
dominant magnetic pole facing the Earth has changed from North to South; (ii) a
change in the direction of the azimuthal B field component as a result of
torsional oscillations of the jet; and (iii) a change in the relative
contributions to the observed rotation measures of the ""inner"" and ""outer""
helical fields in a magnetic-tower model. Although we cannot entirely rule out
the possibility that the observed changes in the RM distribution are associated
instead with changes in the thermal-electron distribution in the vicinity of
the jet, we argue that this explanation is unlikely.

powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not the

the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must therefore exert a
braking torque on the black hole. We calculate the spin-up function for an
accreting black hole, accounting for this braking torque. We find that the
predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole spin and
dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using recent
relativistic magnetohydrodynamical numerical simulation results to calibrate
the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the flow, we find that an ADAF
flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to an equilibrium value of about 96%
of the maximal spin value in the absence of jets. Combining our ADAF system
with a simple model for jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is
reached at approximately 93% of the maximal spin value, as found in the
numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at which
point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by the braking
torque arising from jet production. Our model also yields a relationship
between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in surprisingly good
agreement with that seen in the simulation studies, indicating that our simple

study the magnetic-field structures of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) based on
Faraday Rotation (FR) gradients. A number of transverse FR gradients have been
found, and interpreted as corresponding to helical magnetic fields wrapped
around the jets; the gradients reflect the systematic change in the
line-of-sight component of a toroidal or helical magnetic field across the jet
(e.g Gabuzda, Murray & Cronin 2004). Our observations of a sample of BL Lac
objects at six wavelengths near 2, 4 and 6 cm have also revealed a previously
undetected phenomena: these transverse gradients sometimes change their
direction with distance from the core. We have observed this behaviour in at
least five sources, which display gradients in their VLBI core region opposite
to those in the jet. We suggest that this may be linked to magnetic tower
models. In magnetic tower models, the field lines go outward with the jet and
return and close in the accretion disk (or vice versa); differential rotation
of the accretion disk winds up the inner and outer field lines into two helices
(the inner helix ""nested"" in the outer helix). The total observed FR gradient
is a sum of the effect of these two helical fields. It may be that gradients
detected relatively far from the core correspond to the outer helix, while
gradients detected in the core region correspond to dominance of the inner
helix. This provides tentative evidence for the unification of helical magnetic
fields and magnetic tower models, which could provide crucial new information
for understanding AGN jets. Further VLBI studies with resolution sufficient to
reliably detect these gradients in the cm-wavelength core and inner jet will be
important for further investigations of this phenomena.

of the motion of a point charge, taking into account ""self-force"" effects due
to the particle's own electromagnetic field. We analyze the issue of ""particle

considering a one-parameter family of solutions to the coupled Maxwell and
matter equations corresponding to having a body whose charge-current density
$J^a(\lambda)$ and stress-energy tensor $T_{ab} (\lambda)$ scale to zero size
in an asymptotically self-similar manner about a worldline $\gamma$ as $\lambda
\to 0$. In this limit, the charge, $q$, and total mass, $m$, of the body go to
zero, and $q/m$ goes to a well defined limit. The Maxwell field
$F_{ab}(\lambda)$ is assumed to be the retarded solution associated with
$J^a(\lambda)$ plus a homogeneous solution (the ""external field"") that varies
smoothly with $\lambda$. We prove that the worldline $\gamma$ must be a
solution to the Lorentz force equations of motion in the external field
$F_{ab}(\lambda=0)$. We then obtain self-force, dipole forces, and spin force
as first order perturbative corrections to the center of mass motion of the
body. We believe that this is the first rigorous derivation of the complete
first order correction to Lorentz force motion. We also address the issue of
obtaining a self-consistent perturbative equation of motion associated with our
perturbative result, and argue that the self-force equations of motion that
have previously been written down in conjunction with the ""reduction of order""
procedure should provide accurate equations of motion for a sufficiently small
charged body with negligible dipole moments and spin. There is no corresponding
justification for the non-reduced-order equations.

capacity in a two-user symmetric deterministic interference channel. We find
that having a single feedback link from one of the receivers to its own
transmitter results in the same sum capacity as having a total of 4 feedback
links from both the receivers to both the transmitters. Hence, from the sum
capacity point of view, the three additional feedback links are not helpful. We
also consider a half-duplex feedback model where the forward and the feedback
resources are symmetric and timeshared. Surprisingly, we find that there is no
gain in sum-capacity with feedback in a half-duplex feedback model when
interference links have more capacity than direct links.

those obtained using the NACRE rate. Methods: The triple-alpha reaction rates
are compared by following the evolution of stellar models at 1 and 1.5 Msol

consequences for the late stages of stellar evolution in low mass stars. Most
notable is the shortening--or disappearance--of the red giant phase.
Conclusions: The OKK triple-alpha reaction rate is incompatible with
observations of extended red giant branches and He burning stars in old stellar

hit by a photon after passing through the first grating. The consideration of a
transverse wave function in momentum representation is essential in this study.
As is shown, the number of atoms transmitted through the third grating is given
by a simple periodic function of the lateral shift along this grating, both in
the absence and in the presence of photon scattering. Moreover, the relative
contrast (laser on/laser off) is shown to be a simple analytical function of
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i, where d_p is the distance between atomic paths at the

this dependence, being in agreement with experimental results, can be regarded

on the lattice. Specifically, we use Wilson fermions, and while our
d-dimensional lattice has (d-1) infinite dimensions, the remaining direction is
reduced to a point. We perform a weak-coupling one-loop calculation of the free
energy as a function of the holonomy in the reduced direction, and map the
regimes in the bare lattice parameter space where the holonomy averages to zero
and a Z_N-center symmetric configuration is the ground state. For d=4 and
N_f=1/2,1 and 2 Dirac flavors we see that the center symmetry is intact in a
generous regime of the phase diagram that includes the chiral point. Thus we
see that large-N volume independence of lattice QCD with adjoint Wilson quarks
works at weak coupling. Interestingly, we find that this is true even if the
quark mass is quite large, and this opens a path to study the volume reduced
large-N pure gauge theory. Finally, we analyze in detail the UV sensitivity of
the one-loop potential and show that treating the reduced theory as a
(d-1)-dimensional effective field theory requires the introduction of certain
relevant operators that are a subset of those suggested by Unsal and Yaffe to
stabilize the center symmetry. This means that different regularizations of the
volume-reduced theory can be compared only if one includes these terms in the

potentials in the LCDM model on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) contribution
to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and on the cross-power spectrum of the
CMB and a set of biased tracers of the mass. We use an ensemble of N-body
simulations to directly follow the potentials and compare results to
perturbation theory (PT). The predictions from PT match the results to high
precision for k<0.2 h/Mpc. We compute the nonlinear corrections to the angular
power spectrum and find them to be <10% of linear theory for l<100. These
corrections are swamped by cosmic variance. On scales l>100 the departures are
more significant, however the CMB signal is more than a factor 10^3 larger at
this scale. Nonlinear ISW effects therefore play no role in shaping the CMB
power spectrum for l<1500. We analyze the CMB--density tracer cross-spectrum
using simulations and renormalized bias PT, and find good agreement. The usual
assumption is that nonlinear evolution enhances the growth of structure and
counteracts linear ISW on small scales, leading to a change in sign of the
CMB-LSS cross-spectrum at small scales. However, PT analysis suggests that this
trend reverses at late times when the logarithmic growth rate
f(a)=dlnD/dlna<0.5 or om_m(a)<0.3. Numerical results confirm these expectations
and we find no sign change in ISW-LSS cross-power for low redshifts.
Corrections due to nonlinearity and scale dependence of the bias are found to
be <10% for l<100, therefore below the S/N of the current and future
measurements. Finally, we estimate the CMB--halo cross-correlation coefficient
and show that it can be made to match that for CMB--dark matter to within 5%
for thin redshift shells, mitigating the need to model bias evolution.

In order to test the hypothesis that quiescent red galaxies are formed after a
gas-rich merger involving quasar activity, we confront photometry of massive (M
> 4x10^10 Msun) galaxies extracted from the FIRES, GOODS-South, and MUSYC
surveys, together spanning an area of 496 arcmin^2, with synthetic photometry
from hydrodynamical merger simulations. As in the Hopkins et al. (2006b) model,
we use the observed quasar luminosity function to estimate the merger rate. We
find that the synthetic U-V and V-J colors of galaxies that had a quasar phase
in their past match the colors of observed galaxies that are best characterized
by a quiescent stellar population. At z ~ 2.6, the observed number and mass
density of quiescent red galaxies with M > 4x10^10 Msun is consistent with the
model in which every quiescent massive galaxy underwent a quasar phase in the
past. At z ~ 1.9, 2.8 times less quiescent galaxies are observed than predicted
by the model as descendants of higher redshift quasars. The merger model also
predicts a large number of galaxies undergoing merger-driven star formation. We
find that the predicted number and mass density accounts for 30-50% of the
observed massive star-forming galaxies. However, their colors do not match
those of observed star-forming galaxies. In particular, the colors of dusty red
galaxies are not reproduced by the simulations. Several possible origins of
this discrepancy are discussed. The observational constraints on the validity
of the model are currently limited by cosmic variance and uncertainties in
stellar population synthesis and radiative transfer.

problem through a combination of microphysical restrictions on the phase space
of initial conditions and the existence of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)
attractor in regimes where the slow-roll attractor does not apply. Carrying out
a comprehensive analysis of the parameter space allowed by the latest advances
in brane inflation model-building, we find that these restrictions are
insufficient to solve the overshoot problem. The vast majority of the phase
space of initial conditions is still dominated by overshoot trajectories. We
present an analytic proof that the brane-inflationary attractor must be close
to the slow-roll limit, and update the predictions for observables such as
non-Gaussianity, cosmic string tension and tensor modes.

impacts: for example, sensor networks under sudden power losses or cognitive
radio networks with unpredictable primary user spectrum occupancy. Under such
circumstances, it is critical to quantify how fast and reliably the information
can be collected over attacked links. For a single point-to-point channel
subject to a random attack, named as a \emph{dying channel}, we model it as a
block-fading (BF) channel with a finite and random delay constraint. First, we
define the outage capacity as the performance measure, followed by studying the
optimal coding length $K$ such that the outage probability is minimized when
uniform power allocation is assumed. For a given rate target and a coding
length $K$, we then minimize the outage probability over the power allocation
vector $\mv{P}_{K}$, and show that this optimization problem can be cast into a
convex optimization problem under some conditions. The optimal solutions for
several special cases are discussed.
  Furthermore, we extend the single point-to-point dying channel result to the
parallel multi-channel case where each sub-channel is a dying channel, and
investigate the corresponding asymptotic behavior of the overall outage
probability with two different attack models: the independent-attack case and
the $m$-dependent-attack case. It can be shown that the overall outage
probability diminishes to zero for both cases as the number of sub-channels
increases if the \emph{rate per unit cost} is less than a certain threshold.
The outage exponents are also studied to reveal how fast the outage probability
improves over the number of sub-channels.

users maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and

""participatory journalism"" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that
Keller and Berry argued that through blogging ""one American in tens tells the
other nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy"" \cite{keller1}.
Therefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers.
This problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated
solutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account
temporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is
the most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the
issue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed
blogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging
activity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's
posts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of
the blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of
the post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to
the number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods
are evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification
method utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The
obtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify
significant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.

photons in a very broad energy band: 8keV to >300GeV, have opened a new window
for the study of these enigmatic explosions. It is widely assumed that photons
of energy larger than 100 MeV are produced by the same source that generated
lower energy photons -- at least whenever the shape of the spectrum is a Band
function. We report here a surprising discovery -- the Fermi data for a bright
burst, GRB 080916C, unambiguously shows that the high energy photons (>=
100MeV) were generated in the external shock via the synchrotron process, and
the lower energy photons had a distinctly different source. The magnetic field
in the region where high energy photons were produced (and also the late time
afterglow emission region) is found to be consistent with shock compressed
magnetic field of the circum-stellar medium. This result sheds light on the
important question of the origin of magnetic fields required for gamma-ray
burst afterglows. The external shock model for high energy radiation makes a
firm prediction that can be tested with existing and future observations.

has to be identified from pulses transmitted through the channel. Various
approaches have been proposed in the literature to identify time delays
introduced by multipath environments. However, these methods either operate on
the analog received signal, or require high sampling rates in order to achieve
reasonable time resolution. In this paper, our goal is to develop a unified
approach to time delay estimation from low rate samples of the output of a
multipath channel. Our methods result in perfect recovery of the multipath
delays from samples of the channel output at the lowest possible rate, even in
the presence of overlapping transmitted pulses. This rate depends only on the
number of multipath components and the transmission rate, but not on the
bandwidth of the probing signal. In addition, our development allows for a
variety of different sampling methods. By properly manipulating the low-rate
samples, we show that the time delays can be recovered using the well-known
ESPRIT algorithm. Combining results from sampling theory with those obtained in
the context of direction of arrival estimation methods, we develop necessary
and sufficient conditions on the transmitted pulse and the sampling functions
in order to ensure perfect recovery of the channel parameters at the minimal
possible rate. Our results can be viewed in a broader context, as a sampling
theorem for analog signals defined over an infinite union of subspaces.

averaging of local inhomogeneities in general relativity can lead to
significant dynamical effects on the evolution of the universe and on the
interpretation of cosmological data. In particular, all deductions about
cosmology are based on light paths; averaging can have an important effect on
photon propagation and hence cosmological observations. It would be desirable
to describe the physical effects of averaging in terms of observational
quantities and focussing on the behaviour of light. Data (e.g., matter terms,
such as the density or galaxy number counts, which are already expressed as
averaged quantities) is given on the null cone. Therefore, it is
observationally meaningful to consider light-cone averages of quantities. In
principle, we wish to describe the cosmological equations on the null cone, and
hence we need to construct the averaged geometry on the null cone. However, we
argue that it is still necessary to average the full Einstein field equations
to obtain suitably averaged equations on the null cone. Since it is not the
geometry per se that appears in the observational relations, we discuss whether
it is possible to covariantly `average' just a subset of the evolution
equations on the null cone, focussing on relevant observational quantities. We
present an averaged version of the scalar null Raychaudhuri equation, which may
be a useful first step in this regard.

is relatively unconstrained by experiment, in stark contrast with the level of
accuracy to which Lorentz symmetry has been confirmed in the matter sector. One
model of Lorentz violation in the gravitational sector is Einstein-aether
theory, in which Lorentz symmetry is broken by giving a vacuum expectation
value to a dynamical vector field. In this paper we analyse the effective
theory for quantised gravitational and aether perturbations. We show that this
theory possesses a controlled effective expansion within dimensional
regularisation, that is, for any process there are a finite number of Feynman
diagrams which will contribute to a given order of accuracy. We find that there
is no log-running of the two-derivative phenomenological parameters, justifying
the use of experimental constraints for these parameters obtained over many
orders of magnitude in energy scale. Given the stringent experimental bounds on
two-derivative Lorentz-violating operators, we estimate the size of matter
Lorentz-violation which arises due to loop effects. This amounts to an
estimation of the natural size of coefficients for Lorentz-violating
dimension-six matter operators, which in turn can be used to obtain a new bound
on the two-derivative parameters of this theory.

to the brane gravitational field equations, with properties quite distinct as

consider the spherically symmetric accretion of matter onto brane-world black

interpolates between a low/intermediate redshift parameterization

$\gamma(a)$ can be used when including the CMB to the rest of the data while
the form $\gamma_{_{late}}(a)$ can be used otherwise. It is found that the
parameterizations proposed achieve a fit that is better than 0.004% for the

conditional on the multiple events of price increase/decrease. This is quite
similar to the property reported by previous studies about asset prices.
However, we fail to find a long memory property in the volatility of product

prices is close to an exponential distribution, rather than a power law
distribution. These two findings are in a sharp contrast with the previous
results regarding asset prices. We propose an interpretation that these

we study the detectability of high-energy neutrinos, paying particular
attention to those produced from charmed-mesons. We highlight important
distinguishing features in the ultra-high energy neutrino flux which would act
as markers for the role of charm in the source. In particular, charm leads to
significant event rates at higher energies, after the conventional (pi, K)
neutrino fluxes fall off. We calculate event rates both for a nearby single
source and for diffuse SJS fluxes for an IceCube-like detector. By comparing
muon event rates for the conventional and prompt fluxes in different energy
bins, we demonstrate the striking energy dependence in the rates induced by the
presence of charm. We also show that it leads to an energy dependant flux ratio
of shower to muon events, providing an additional important diagnostic tool for
the presence of prompt neutrinos. Motivated by the infusion of high energy
anti-electron neutrinos into the flux by charm decay, we also study the
detectability of the Glashow resonance due to these sources.

generalized symmetry of a nonlinear PDE to a new symmetry. Therefore, the
existence of a recursion operator guarantees that the PDE has infinitely many
higher-order symmetries, which is a key feature of complete integrability.
Completely integrable nonlinear PDEs have a bi-Hamiltonian structure and a Lax
pair; they can also be solved with the inverse scattering transform and admit
soliton solutions of any order.
  A straightforward method for the symbolic computation of polynomial recursion
operators of nonlinear PDEs in (1+1) dimensions is presented. Based on
conserved densities and generalized symmetries, a candidate recursion operator
is built from a linear combination of scaling invariant terms with undetermined
coefficients. The candidate recursion operator is substituted into its defining
equation and the resulting linear system for the undetermined coefficients is
solved.
  The method is algorithmic and is implemented in Mathematica. The resulting
symbolic package PDERecursionOperator.m can be used to test the complete
integrability of polynomial PDEs that can be written as nonlinear evolution
equations. With PDERecursionOperator.m, recursion operators were obtained for
several well-known nonlinear PDEs from mathematical physics and soliton theory.

logs. For this purpose, a macrodynamic-like quantitative model of the
Information Retrieval (IR) process is developed, whose paradigm is inspired by
basic constructions of Einstein's general relativity theory in which all IR
objects are uniformly placed in a common Room. The Room has a structure similar
to Einsteinian spacetime, namely that of a smooth manifold. Documents and
queries are treated as matter objects and sources of material fields.
Relevance, the central notion of IR, becomes a dynamical issue controlled by
both gravitation (or, more precisely, as the motion in a curved spacetime) and
forces originating from the interactions of matter fields. The spatio-temporal
description ascribes dynamics to any document or query, thus providing a
uniform description for documents of both initially static and dynamical
nature. Within the IR context, the techniques presented are based on two ideas.
The first is the placement of all objects participating in IR into a common
continuous space. The second idea is the `objectivization' of the IR process;
instead of expressing users' wishes, we consider the overall IR as an objective
physical process, representing the IR process in terms of motion in a given
external-fields configuration. Various semantic environments are treated as
various IR universes.

by a shear layer. We apply the appropriate conservation laws to constrain the
jet parameters, starting the model where the radio emission is observed to
brighten abruptly. We assume that the laminar flow fills the jet there and that
pressure balance with the surroundings is maintained from that point outwards.
Entrainment continuously injects new material into the jet and forms a shear
layer, which contains material from both the environment and the laminar core.
The shear layer expands rapidly with distance until finally the core
disappears, and all of the material is mixed into the shear layer. Beyond this
point, the shear layer expands in a cone and decelerates smoothly. We apply our
model to the well-observed FRI source 3C31 and show that there is a
self-consistent solution. We derive the jet power, together with the variations
of mass flux and and entrainment rate with distance from the nucleus. The
predicted variation of bulk velocity with distance in the outer parts of the
jets is in good agreement with model fits to VLA observations. Our prediction
for the shape of the laminar core can be tested with higher-resolution imaging.

the solar motion and the structure of the local velocity ellipsoids. When the
principal velocity dispersions are assumed to increase with time as t^\beta,
the index \beta is larger for \sigma_W (\beta_W~0.45) than for \sigma_U
(\beta_U~0.31). For the three-dimensional velocity dispersion we obtain
\beta=0.35. We exclude saturation of disc heating after ~3 Gyr as proposed by
Quillen & Garnett(2000). Saturation after >~4 Gyr combined with an abrupt
increase in velocity dispersion for the oldest stars cannot be excluded. For
all our models the star-formation rate is declining, being a factor 2-7 lower
now than it was at the beginning. Models in which the SFR declines
exponentially favour very high disc ages between 11.5 and 13 Gyr and exclude
ages below ~10.5 Gyr as they yield worse fits to the number density and
velocity dispersion of red stars. Models in which the SFR is the sum of two
declining exponentials representing the thin and thick discs favour ages
between 10.5 and 12 Gyr with a lower limit of ~10.0 Gyr. Although in our models
the star-formation rate peaked surprisingly early, the mean formation time of
solar-neighbourhood stars is later than in ab-initio models of galaxy
formation, probably on account of weaknesses in such models.

Array (SMA) imaging observations with a resolution ~1"" show that the submm (850
micron) emission is extended on scales of 10--35kpc and is offset from the
optical position by ~10 kpc. This morphology is dissimilar to that found in
submm galaxies, which are generally un- or marginally resolved on arcsecond
scales, or submm-luminous AGN where the AGN lies at the peak of the submm or
molecular emission. The simplest explanation is that the object is in the early
stages of a merger between a gas rich galaxy, which hosts the starburst, and a
gas-poor AGN-host galaxy, which is responsible for the quasar emission. It is
also possible that jet induced star formation might contribute to the unusual

planning with proton and ion beams, based on an efficient kernel-convolution
method referred to as grid-dose spreading (GDS) and accurate
heterogeneity-correction method referred to as Gaussian beam splitting. The
original GDS algorithm suffered from distortion of dose distribution for beams
tilted with respect to the dose-grid axes. Use of intermediate grids normal to
the beam field has solved the beam-tilting distortion. Interplay of arrangement
between beams and grids was found as another intrinsic source of artifact.
Inclusion of rectangular-kernel convolution in beam transport, to share the
beam contribution among the nearest grids in a regulatory manner, has solved
the interplay problem. This algorithmic framework was applied to a tilted
proton pencil beam and a broad carbon-ion beam. In these cases, while the
elementary pencil beams individually split into several tens, the calculation
time increased only by several times with the GDS algorithm. The GDS and
beam-splitting methods will complementarily enable accurate and efficient dose
calculations for radiotherapy with protons and ions.

any time $t$ if the dynamical rule, i.e. Newton's equations of motion, can be
solved; this requires specification of the gravitational potential. The
evolution of a bunch of phase space coordinates ${\bf w}$ is deterministic,
though generally non-linear. We discuss the novel Bayesian non-parametric
algorithm CHASSIS that gives phase space $pdf$ $f({\bf w})$ and potential
$\Phi({\bf x})$ of a relaxed gravitational system. CHASSIS is undemanding in
terms of input requirements in that it is viable given incomplete,
single-component velocity information of system members. Here ${\bf x}$ is the
3-D spatial coordinate and ${\bf w}={\bf x+v}$ where ${\bf v}$ is the 3-D
velocity vector. CHASSIS works with a 2-integral $f=f(E, L)$ where energy
$E=\Phi + v^2/2, \: v^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{3}{v_i^2}$ and the angular momentum is $L
= |{\bf r}\times{\bf v}|$, where ${\bf r}$ is the spherical spatial vector.
Also, we assume spherical symmetry. CHASSIS obtains the $f(\cdot)$ from which
the kinematic data is most likely to have been drawn, in the best choice for
$\Phi(\cdot)$, using an MCMC optimiser (Metropolis-Hastings). The likelihood
function ${\cal{L}}$ is defined in terms of the projections of $f(\cdot)$ into
the space of observables and the maximum in ${\cal{L}}$ is sought by the
optimiser.

according to its specification. In this paper, we present a snap-stabilizing
protocol to solve the message forwarding problem in a message-switched network.
In this problem, we must manage resources of the system to deliver messages to
any processor of the network. In this purpose, we use information given by a
routing algorithm. By the context of stabilization (in particular, the system
starts in an arbitrary configuration), this information can be corrupted. So,
the existence of a snap-stabilizing protocol for the message forwarding problem
implies that we can ask the system to begin forwarding messages even if routing
information are initially corrupted. In this paper, we propose two
snap-stabilizing algorithms (in the state model) for the following
specification of the problem: - Any message can be generated in a finite time.
- Any emitted message is delivered to its destination once and only once in a
finite time. This implies that our protocol can deliver any emitted message
regardless of the state of routing tables in the initial configuration. These
two algorithms are based on the previous work of [MS78]. Each algorithm needs a
particular method to be transform into a snap-stabilizing one but both of them
do not introduce a significant overcost in memory or in time with respect to
algorithms of [MS78].

residual acceleration induced by weak limit gravity from multiple topological

present epoch, the residual gravity effect is about a million times weaker in
three of the well-proportioned spaces than in ill-proportioned spaces. However,
in the Poincare space, the effect is 10,000 times weaker still, i.e. the

an asymptotic state in the limit of large times. We express the latter in terms
of the resonance data of a reduced propagator of S+R and show that it satisfies

evolution of the diamagnetic spectrum of a graphene dot including the formation
of the E = 0 Landau level, situated in the center of the transport gap, and
marking the electron-hole crossover.

In
particular, we investigate the case when the bath is initially prepared in a
pure state known as the Schr\""odinger cat. In clear contradistinction to the
time-evolution of an initial coherent state, the time evolutions of the purity
and the coherence factor now depend on the particular choice of the
Schr\""odinger cat state. We also demonstrate that the evolution of the
entanglement of a two--qubit system depends on the initial conditions in a
similar way.

a supercritical string cosmology and interesting cosmological modifications are
obtained. The two main results we focus on in this work are: fractal scaling
for relativisitic matter which occurs naturally in a radiation dominated era
and effects (maybe considerable) on the relic abundances of supersymmetric dark
matter candidates (neutralinos) which are obtained by solving the modified
Boltzmann equation. In fact these last effects can be linked to a very rich
phenomenology yielding important restrictions.In the end of the paper we also
give the general framework of the D-particles foam model, which as proved can
give rise to statistical effects similar to Tsallis effects, by basically
assuming a stochastic gravitational background.

the varying sensitivity) and the presence of big impulsive disturbances. In
such conditions the estimation of the standard deviation of the Gaussian
process done with a classical estimator applied after a ""rough"" cleaning of the

inflaton -- is usually assumed to be an elementary field. In this essay, we
ask: What are the observational signatures, if the scalar field is a spinor
condensate? and Is there a way to distinguish between the canonical scalar
field and the spinor condensate driven models? In the homogeneous and isotropic
background, we show that, although the dark-spinor (Elko) condensate leads to
the identical acceleration equation as that of the canonical scalar field
driven inflation, the dynamics of the two models are different. In the
slow-roll limit, we show that the model, predicts a running of scalar spectral
index consistent with the WMAP data. We show that the consistency relations
between the spinor condensate and canonical scalar field driven model are
different which can be tested using the future CMB and gravitational wave
missions.
