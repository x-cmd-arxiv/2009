covariantizing the decoupling lagrangian of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Poratti (DGP)
model. Despite being local in 3+1 dimensions, the resulting cosmological
evolution is remarkably similar to that of the full 4+1-dimensional DGP
framework, both for the expansion history and the evolution of density
perturbations. As in the DGP model, the covariant galileon theory yields two
branches of solutions, depending on the sign of the galileon velocity.
Perturbations are stable on one branch and ghost-like on the other. An
interesting effect uncovered in our analysis is a cosmological version of the
Vainshtein screening mechanism: at early times, the galileon dynamics are
dominated by self-interaction terms, resulting in its energy density being
suppressed compared to matter or radiation; once the matter density has
redshifted sufficiently, the galileon becomes an important component of the
energy density and contributes to dark energy. We estimate conservatively that
the resulting expansion history is consistent with the observed late-time
cosmology, provided that the scale of modification satisfies r_c > 15 Gpc.

Bergshoeff, Hohm and Townsend (BHT) is considered. At the special case when the
theory admits a unique maximally symmetric solution, a conformally flat space
that contains black holes and gravitational solitons for any value of the
cosmological constant is found. For negative cosmological constant, the black
hole is characterized in terms of the mass and the ""gravitational hair""
parameter, providing a lower bound for the mass. For negative mass parameter,
the black hole acquires an inner horizon, and the entropy vanishes at the
extremal case. Gravitational solitons and kinks, being regular everywhere, are
obtained from a double Wick rotation of the black hole. A wormhole solution in
vacuum that interpolates between two static universes of negative spatial
curvature is obtained as a limiting case of the gravitational soliton with a
suitable identification. The black hole and the gravitational soliton fit
within a set of relaxed asymptotically AdS conditions as compared with the ones
of Brown and Henneaux. In the case of positive cosmological constant the black
hole possesses an event and a cosmological horizon, whose mass is bounded from
above. Remarkably, the temperatures of the event and the cosmological horizons
coincide, and at the extremal case one obtains the analogue of the Nariai
solution, $dS_{2}\times S^{1}$. A gravitational soliton is also obtained
through a double Wick rotation of the black hole. The Euclidean continuation of
these solutions describes instantons with vanishing Euclidean action. For
vanishing cosmological constant the black hole and the gravitational soliton
are asymptotically locally flat spacetimes. The rotating solutions can be
obtained by boosting the previous ones in the $t-\phi$ plane.

changes over time with respect to a fixed sky co-ordinate grid. For example,
during two months of daily observations with the VLBA by Mioduszewski et al.
(2004), a steady rotation through ~10 degrees is observed whilst the jet angle
changes by ~20 degrees. The ruff reorientation is not coupled with the
well-known precession of SS433's radio jets, as the ruff orientation varies
across a range of 69 degrees whilst the jet angle varies across 40 degrees, and
on greatly differing and non-commensurate timescales.

so we present the results of 3D numerical simulations of circumbinary orbits.
These simulations show precession in the longitude of the ascending node of all

described correctly quantum mechanically. The approach is based on the
thermodynamic integration with respect to the mass of isotopes and on the
Feynman path integral representation of the partition function. An efficient

independent of the number of imaginary time slices in the path integral,
speeding up calculations by a factor of 60 at 500 K. We describe the

The method is tested on three [1,5] sigmatropic hydrogen shift reactions.

the equilibrium isotope effects within the harmonic approximation, and then the
path integral method together with semiempirical potentials to evaluate the

population properties, after removing AGN contaminants from the sample. Dust
unbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local
radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: i) specific star
formation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the
highest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function of
galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower
mass objects; iii) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies
would lead to grossly underestimate the SFR in massive galaxies; iv) correcting
the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe
provide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the mean

maintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happen
because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most
massive galaxies.

appropriate foundation for modern mathematics, proof theorists have known for
decades that virtually all mainstream mathematics can actually be formalized in
much weaker systems which are essentially number-theoretic in nature. Feferman
has observed that this severely undercuts a famous argument of Quine and Putnam
according to which set theoretic platonism is validated by the fact that
mathematics is ""indispensable"" for some successful scientific theories (since
in fact ZFC is not needed for the mathematics that is currently used in
science).
  I extend this critique in three ways: (1) not only is it possible to
formalize core mathematics in these weaker systems, they are in important ways
better suited to the task than ZFC; (2) an improved analysis of the
proof-theoretic strength of predicative theories shows that most if not all of
the already rare examples of mainstream theorems whose proofs are currently
thought to require metaphysically substantial set-theoretic principles actually
do not; and (3) set theory itself, as it is actually practiced, is best
understood in formalist, not platonic, terms, so that in a real sense *set
theory is not even indispensable for set theory*. I also make the point that
even if ZFC is consistent, there are good reasons to suspect that some
number-theoretic assertions provable in ZFC may be false. This suggests that
set theory should not be considered central to mathematics.

resolution including gas physics and a model for BH seeding, growth and
feedback. Assuming that the initial BH seeds are relatively massive, of the
order of 10^5 Msun, and that seeding occurs around z~15 in dark matter haloes
of mass 10^9-10^10 Msun, we find that it is possible to build up supermassive
BHs (SMBHs) by z=6 that assemble most of their mass during extended
Eddington-limited accretion periods. The properties of the simulated SMBHs are
consistent with observations of z=6 quasars in terms of the estimated BH masses
and bolometric luminosities, the amount of star formation occurring within the
host halo, and the presence of highly enriched gas in the innermost regions of
the host galaxy. After a peak in the BH accretion rate at z=6, the most massive
BH has become sufficiently massive for the growth to enter into a much slower
phase of feedback-regulated accretion. We explore the full range of expected
recoils and radiative efficiencies, and also consider models with spinning BHs.
In the most `pessimistic' case where BH spins are initially high, we find that
the growth of the SMBHs can be potentially hampered if they grow mostly in
isolation and experience only a small number of mergers. Whereas BH kicks can
expel a substantial fraction of low mass BHs, they do not significantly affect
the build up of the SMBHs. On the contrary, a large number of BH mergers has
beneficial consequences for the growth of the SMBHs by considerably reducing
their spin. [Abridged]

Here, we suggest that the opposite might be the case: coronal X-rays modulate
the accretion flow. We re-examine the X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars in
the Orion Nebula Cluster and find that not only are accreting stars
systematically fainter, but that there is a correlation between mass accretion
rate and stellar X-ray luminosity. We use the X-ray heated accretion disk
models of Ercolano et al. to show that protoplanetary disk photoevaporative
mass loss rates are strongly dependent on stellar X-ray luminosity and
sufficiently high to be competitive with accretion rates. X-ray disk heating
appears to offer a viable mechanism for modulating the gas accretion flow and
could be at least partially responsible for the observed correlation between
accretion rates and X-ray luminosities of T Tauri stars.

evolution of metals and dust on the stellar characteristic lifetimes, taking
into account dust destruction mechanisms.Using a grid of stellar dust yields as
a function of the initial mass and metallicity over the range 1-40 Msun and 0-1
Zsun,we show that the role of AGB stars in cosmic dust evolution at high
redshift might have been over-looked.We apply the chemical evolution model with
dust to the host galaxy of the most distant quasar at z=6.4, SDSS
J1148+5251.Given the current uncertainties on the star formation history of the
host galaxy, we have considered two models: (i) a star formation history
obtained in a numerical simulation by Li et al.(2007) which predicts that a
large stellar bulge is already formed at z=6.4,and (ii) a constant star
formation rate of 1000 Msun/yr, as suggested by the observations if most of the
FIR luminosity is due to young stars.The total mass of dust predicted at z=6.4
by the first model is 2x10^8Msun,within the range of values inferred by
observations,with a substantial contribution (80%) of AGB-dust.When a constant
star formation rate is adopted,the contribution of AGB-dust decreases to 50%
but the total mass of dust formed is a factor 2 smaller.Both models predict a
rapid enrichment of the ISM with metals and a relatively mild evolution of the
carbon abundance,in agreement with observational constraints. This supports the
idea that stellar sources can account for the dust observed but show that the
contribution of AGB stars to dust production cannot be neglected, even at the
most extreme redshifts currently accessible to observations.

ultra-compact with half-light radii of ~1 kpc. We have obtained a ~29 hr
spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the Gemini
Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and
several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z>2
quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar
population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3
Msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of ~2x10^11 Msol. We detect
several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha,
[SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line
regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies
active star formation. The current SFR is <1% of the past average SFR. If this
galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies
that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that
low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects.
Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we
show that the AGN contributes <8% to the rest-frame optical emission. A
possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly;
although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up <10% of the total stellar
mass, it could account for up to ~40% of the optical light. Nevertheless, this
spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar
population.

presents a number of puzzles. Firstly, its polar alignment stands out from the
planar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. Secondly, recent proper
motion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least 3, and
possibly as many as 8, of the Milky Ways satellites point (within 30 degrees)
along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form of
coherent motion. In this paper we use a high resolution cosmological simulation
to investigate whether this pattern conflicts with the expectations of the cold
dark matter model of structure formation. We find that this seemingly unlikely
set up occurs often: approximately 35% of the time we find systems in which the
angular momentum of 3 individual satellites point along, or close to, the short
axis of the satellite distribution. In addition, in 30% of the systems we find
that the net angular momentum of the 6 best aligned satellites lies within 35
degrees of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for the
Milky Way.

delayed by $\approx 5$s with respect to the $\epsilon \lesssim 1$ MeV emission,
and (iii) the emission onset times shift towards later times in the higher
energy bands. We show that this behavior of the high-energy emission can be
explained by a model in which the prompt emission consists of two components:
one is the emission component peaking at $\epsilon \sim 1$ MeV due to the
synchrotron-self-Compton radiation of electrons accelerated in the internal
shock of the jet and the other is the component peaking at $\epsilon \sim 100$
MeV due to up-scattering of the photospheric X-ray emission of the expanding
cocoon (i.e., the hot bubble produced by dissipation of the jet energy inside
the progenitor star) off the same electrons in the jet. Based on this model, we
derive some constraints on the radius of the progenitor star and the total
energy and mass of the cocoon of this GRB, which may provide information on the
structure of the progenitor star and the physical conditions of the jet
propagating in the star. The up-scattered cocoon emission could be important
for other Fermi-GRBs as well. We discuss some predictions of this model,
including a prompt bright optical emission and a soft X-ray excess.

gravity in a curved background is performed. For tensor and vector modes, the
analysis is very close to that of Minkowski space. The most interesting results
are in the scalar sector where, generically, there are two propagating degrees
of freedom (DOF). While in maximally symmetric spaces ghost-like instabilities
are inevitable, they can be avoided in a FRW background. The phases with less
than two DOF in the scalar sector are also studied. Curvature allows an
interesting interplay with the mass parameters; in particular, we have extended
the Higuchi bound of dS to FRW and Lorentz breaking masses. As in dS, when the
bound is saturated there is no propagating DOF in the scalar sector. In a
number of phases the smallness of the kinetic terms gives rise to strongly
coupled scalar modes at low energies. Finally, we have computed the
gravitational potentials for point-like sources. In the general case we recover
the GR predictions at small distances, whereas the modifications appear at
distances of the order of the characteristic mass scale. In contrast with
Minkowski space, these corrections may not spoil the linear approximation at

in f_{nl}, distributions at fixed overdensity are unchanged from the case
f_{nl}=0. We use this generalization to estimate the effect of f_{nl}\ne 0 on
the abundance of virialized halos. Halo abundances are expected to be related
to the probability that a certain quantity in the initial fluctuation field
exceeds a threshold value, and we study two choices for this variable: it can
either be the sum of the eigenvalues of the initial deformation tensor (the
initial overdensity), or its smallest eigenvalue. The approach based on a
critical overdensity yields results which are in excellent agreement with
numerical measurements. We then use these same methods to develop
approximations describing the sensitivity of void abundances on f_{nl}. While a
positive f_{nl} produces more extremely massive halos, it makes fewer extremely
large voids. Its effect thus is qualitatively different from a simple rescaling
of the normalisation of the density fluctuation field \sigma_8. Therefore, void
abundances furnish complementary information to cluster abundances, and a joint
comparison of both might provide interesting constraints on primordial
non-Gaussianity.

setup automatically lowers the fundamental gravity cutoff down to TeV, and
thus, accounts for the quantum stability of the weak scale. We study the
phenomenology of this framework and show that below TeV energies the copies are
well hidden, obeying all the existing observational bounds. Nevertheless, we
identify a potential low energy window into the hidden world, the oscillation
of the neutron into its dark copies. At the same time, proton decay can be
suppressed by gauging the diagonal baryon number of the different copies. This
framework offers an alternative approach to several particle physics questions.
For example, we suggest a novel mechanism for generating naturally small
neutrino masses that are suppressed by the number of neutrino species. The
mirror copies of the Standard Model naturally house dark matter candidates. The
general experimentally observable prediction of this scenario is an emergence
of strong gravitational effects at the LHC. The low energy permutation symmetry
powerfully constrains the form of this new gravitational physics and allows to
make observational predictions, such as, production of micro black-holes with
very peculiar properties.

Overall, the global properties of the detected galaxies match those of other

already indicate that an extension of the present pilot survey is bound to

ii regions around massive Population III stars in minihaloes. We trace the
highly anisotropic breakout of the ionising radiation into the intergalactic
medium, allowing us to predict the resulting recombination radiation with
greatly increased realism. Our simulations, together with Press-Schechter type
arguments, allow us to predict the Population III contribution to the radio
background at 100 MHz via bremsstrahlung and 21 cm emission. We find a global
bremsstrahlung signal of around 1 mK, and a combined 21 cm signature which is
an order of magnitude larger. Both might be within reach of the planned Square
Kilometer Array experiment, although detection of the free-free emission is
only marginal. The imprint of the first stars on the cosmic radio background
might provide us with one of the few diagnostics to test the otherwise elusive

correlate efficacy of CD8$^+$T cell responses with protection against viral
infections. In part, this difficulty is due to our poor understanding of the in
vivo efficacy of CD8$^+$T cells. Using a recently developed experimental method
of in vivo cytotoxicity we investigated quantitative aspects of killing of
peptide-pulsed targets by effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, specific to three
epitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the mouse spleen. By
analyzing data on killing of targets with varying number of epitope-specific
effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, we find that killing of targets by
effectors follows the law of mass-action, that is the death rate of
peptide-pulsed targets is proportional to the frequency of CTLs in the spleen.
In contrast, killing of targets by memory CD8$^+$T cells does not follow the
mass action law because the death rate of targets saturates at high frequencies
of memory CD8$^+$T cells. For both effector and memory cells, we also find no
support for a killing term that includes the decrease of the death rate of
targets with increasing target cell density. Importantly, we find that at low
CD8$^+$T cell frequencies, effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells on the per capita
basis are equally efficient at killing peptide-pulsed targets. Our framework
provides the guideline for the calculation of the level of memory CD8$^+$T
cells required to provide sterilizing protection against viral infection. Our
results thus form a basis for quantitative understanding of the process of
killing of virus-infected cells by T cell responses in tissues and can be used
to correlate the phenotype of vaccine-induced memory CD8 T cells with their
killing efficacy in vivo.

the superconducting transition, which may suggest the presence of enhanced
superconducting fluctuations in the samples. The positive magnetic field shift
of the temperatures, which limit the magneto-resistivity and the specific heat

probing the influence of the ferromagnetic Ru interactions in an effective

that the oscillations in the stars have amplitudes large enough to be clearly
observable; and that the oscillations themselves be stable enough to enable
precise measurements of mode frequencies and other parameters. Solar-like p
modes are damped by convection, and hence the stability of the modes depends on
the lifetime.
  We seek a simple scaling relation between the mean lifetime of the most
prominent solar-like p modes in stars, and the fundamental stellar parameters.
  We base our search for a relation on use of stellar equilibrium and pulsation
computations of a grid of stellar models, and the first asteroseismic results
on lifetimes of main-sequence, sub-giant and red-giant stars.
  We find that the mean lifetimes of all three classes of solar-like stars
scale like $T_{\rm eff}^{-4}$ (where $T_{\rm eff}$ is the effective
temperature). When this relation is combined with the well-known scaling
relation of Kjeldsen & Bedding (1995) for mode amplitudes observed in
narrow-band intensity observations, we obtain the unexpected result that the
height (the maximum power spectral density) of mode peaks in the frequency
power spectrum scales as $g^{-2}$ (where $g$ is the surface gravity). As it is
the mode height (and not the amplitude) that fixes the S/N at which the modes
can be measured, and as $g$ changes only slowly along the main sequence, this
suggests that stars cooler than the Sun might be as good targets for
asteroseismology as their hotter counterparts. When observations are instead
made in Doppler velocity, our results imply that mode height then does increase
with increasing effective temperature.

blue-emitting polymers with intriguing structure-property relationships. Slight
variations in the choice of functionalizing side chains result in dramatic
differences in the inter- and intra-chain structures in PFs. We present
photoluminescence (PL) and Raman scattering studies of bulk samples and thin
films of dioctyl-substituted PF (PF8) under hydrostatic pressure. The bulk
sample was further thermally annealed at 1.9 GPa. The PL vibronics of the as-is
sample red-shift at an average rate of 26 meV/GPa. The thermally annealed
sample is characterized by at least two phase transitions at 1.1 GPa and 4.2
GPa, each of which has a different pressure coefficient for PL vibronics. The
Huang-Rhys factor, a measure of the electron-phonon interaction, is found to
increase with increasing pressures signaling a higher geometric relaxation of
the electronic states. The Raman peaks harden with increasing pressures; the
intra-ring C-C stretch frequency at 1600 cm$^{-1}$ has a pressure coefficient
of 7.2 cm$^{-1}$/GPa and exhibits asymmetric line shapes at higher pressures,
characteristic of a strong electron-phonon interaction. The optical properties
of PF8 under high pressure are further contrasted with those of a branched side
chain substituted PF.

entity with constant memory, an agent, has to visit all n nodes of an arbitrary
undirected graph G in a periodic manner. Graphs are supposed to be anonymous,
that is, nodes are unlabeled. However, while visiting a node, the robot has to
distinguish between edges incident to it. For each node v the endpoints of the
edges incident to v are uniquely identified by different integer labels called
port numbers. We are interested in minimisation of the length of the
exploration period.
  This problem is unsolvable if the local port numbers are set arbitrarily.
However, surprisingly small periods can be achieved when assigning carefully
the local port numbers. Dobrev et al. described an algorithm for assigning port
numbers, and an oblivious agent (i.e. agent with no memory) using it, such that
the agent explores all graphs of size n within period 10n. Providing the agent
with a constant number of memory bits, the optimal length of the period was
previously proved to be no more than 3.75n (using a different assignment of the
port numbers). In this paper, we improve both these bounds. More precisely, we
show a period of length at most 4 1/3 n for oblivious agents, and a period of
length at most 3.5n for agents with constant memory. Moreover, we give the
first non-trivial lower bound, 2.8n, on the period length for the oblivious
case.

problem in computational biology due to its critical significance in wide
ranging applications including haplotype reconstruction, sequence homology,
phylogenetic analysis, and prediction of evolutionary origins. The MSA problem
is considered NP-hard and known heuristics for the problem do not scale well
with increasing number of sequences. On the other hand, with the advent of new
breed of fast sequencing techniques it is now possible to generate thousands of
sequences very quickly. For rapid sequence analysis, it is therefore desirable
to develop fast MSA algorithms that scale well with the increase in the dataset
size. In this paper, we present a novel domain decomposition based technique to
solve the MSA problem on multiprocessing platforms. The domain decomposition
based technique, in addition to yielding better quality, gives enormous
advantage in terms of execution time and memory requirements. The proposed
strategy allows to decrease the time complexity of any known heuristic of
O(N)^x complexity by a factor of O(1/p)^x, where N is the number of sequences,
x depends on the underlying heuristic approach, and p is the number of
processing nodes. In particular, we propose a highly scalable algorithm,
Sample-Align-D, for aligning biological sequences using Muscle system as the
underlying heuristic. The proposed algorithm has been implemented on a cluster
of workstations using MPI library. Experimental results for different problem
sizes are analyzed in terms of quality of alignment, execution time and
speed-up.

the symmetric case where all direct links have the same signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and all undesired links have the same interference-to-noise ratio (INR).
The gap to the exact capacity is a constant which is independent of SNR and
INR. To get this result, we first generalize the deterministic interference
channel introduced by El Gamal and Costa to model interference channels with
multiple antennas. We derive the capacity region of this deterministic
interference channel. Based on the insights provided by the deterministic
channel, we characterize the generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) of Gaussian
case, which directly leads to the O(1) capacity approximation. On the
achievability side, an interesting conclusion is that the generalized degrees
of freedom (GDOF) regime where treating interference as noise is found to be
optimal in the 2 user interference channel, does not appear in the N+1 user, 1

this work that do not follow directly from the 2 user case. In addition to the
GDOF region, the outer bounds identify a strong interference regime where the

source is now resolved into two sources, SMM1 and SMM2, with a separation of ~
84 AU. SMM1 is seen at the center of the jet, probably tracing a (inner) dusty
disk around the protostar driving the jet. SMM2 is seen to the southwest of
SMM1 and may trace an envelope-disk around a small binary companion. A
flattened envelope-disk is seen in HCO+ around SMM1 with a radius of ~ 80 AU
perpendicular to the jet axis. Its velocity structure is consistent with a
rotation motion and can be fitted with a Keplerian law that yields a mass of ~
50+-15 Jupiter mass (a mass of a brown dwarf) for the protostar. Thus, the
protostar could be the lowest mass source known to have a collimated jet and a
rotating flattened envelope-disk. A small-scale (~ 200 AU) low-speed (~ 2 km/s)
outflow is seen in HCOP+ around the jet axis extending from the envelope-disk.
It seems to rotate in the same direction as the envelope-disk and may carry
away part of the angular momentum from the envelope-disk. The jet is seen in
SiO close to ~ 100 AU from SMM1. It is seen with a ""C-shaped"" bending. It has a
transverse width of <~ 40 AU and a velocity of ~ 170+-60 km/s. A possible
velocity gradient is seen consistently across its innermost pair of knots, with
~ 0.5 km/s at ~ 10 AU, consistent with the sense of rotation of the
envelope-disk. If this gradient is an upper limit of the true rotational
gradient of the jet, then the jet carries away a very small amount of angular
momentum of ~ 5 AU km/s and thus must be launched from the very inner edge of
the disk near the corotation radius.

In the context of the four-dimensional theory, we investigate what happens when
the Kahler moduli are changed from the supersymmetric to the non-supersymmetric
region. Our results provide a low-energy description of supersymmetry breaking
by internal gauge fields as well as a physical picture for the mathematical
notion of bundle stability. Specifically, we find that at the transition
between the two regions an additional anomalous U(1) symmetry appears under
which some of the states in the low-energy theory acquire charges. We compute
the associated D-term contribution to the four-dimensional potential which
contains a Kahler-moduli dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos term and contributions from
the charged states. We show that this D-term correctly reproduces the expected
physics. Several mathematical conclusions concerning vector bundle stability
are drawn from our arguments. We also discuss possible physical applications of
our results to heterotic model building and moduli stabilization.

level hybrid potentials with variable mass terms and nonminimal gravitational
coupling $\xi R\phi^2$. We consider perturbations generated through modulated
reheating and/or curvaton mechanisms in place of the observationally
unacceptable primary spectra generated by inflaton fluctuations in these

issue on the privacy exposure of the current group based approach. This has
been overlooked in the past. The group based anonymization approach basically
hides each individual record behind a group to preserve data privacy. If not
properly anonymized, patterns can actually be derived from the published data
and be used by the adversary to breach individual privacy. For example, from
the medical records released, if patterns such as people from certain countries
rarely suffer from some disease can be derived, then the information can be
used to imply linkage of other people in an anonymized group with this disease
with higher likelihood. We call the derived patterns from the published data
the foreground knowledge. This is in contrast to the background knowledge that
the adversary may obtain from other channels as studied in some previous work.
Finally, we show by experiments that the attack is realistic in the privacy

law P_HI(U) = A U^\alpha for 6 of these galaxies, indicating turbulence is
operational. The estimated best fit value for the slope ranges from ~ -1.5 (AND
IV, NGC 628, UGC 4459 and GR 8) to ~ -2.6 (DDO 210 and NGC 3741). We interpret
this bi-modality as being due to having effectively 2D turbulence on length
scales much larger than the scale height of the galaxy disk and 3D otherwise.
This allows us to use the estimated slope to set bounds on the scale heights of
the face-on galaxies in our sample. We also find that the power law slope
remains constant as we increase the channel thickness for all these galaxies,
suggesting that the fluctuations in HI intensity are due to density
fluctuations and not velocity fluctuations, or that the slope of the velocity
structure function is ~ 0. Finally, for the four galaxies with ""2D turbulence""
we find that the slope \alpha correlates with the star formation rate per unit
area, with larger star formation rates leading to steeper power laws. Given our
small sample size this result needs to be confirmed with a larger sample.

dwarf novae based on newly obtained data and past publications. In many
systems, the evolution of superhump period are found to be composed of three
distinct stages: early evolutionary stage with a longer superhump period,
middle stage with systematically varying periods, final stage with a shorter,
stable superhump period. During the middle stage, many systems with superhump
periods less than 0.08 d show positive period derivatives. Contrary to the
earlier claim, we found no clear evidence for variation of period derivatives
between superoutburst of the same object. We present an interpretation that the
lengthening of the superhump period is a result of outward propagation of the
eccentricity wave and is limited by the radius near the tidal truncation. We
interpret that late stage superhumps are rejuvenized excitation of 3:1
resonance when the superhumps in the outer disk is effectively quenched. Many
of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae showed long-enduring superhumps during the
post-superoutburst stage having periods longer than those during the main
superoutburst. The period derivatives in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are found to
be strongly correlated with the fractional superhump excess, or consequently,
mass ratio. WZ Sge-type dwarf novae with a long-lasting rebrightening or with
multiple rebrightenings tend to have smaller period derivatives and are
excellent candidate for the systems around or after the period minimum of
evolution of cataclysmic variables (abridged).

E. Cohen in 1968. The
competition graph C(D) of a digraph D is a (simple undirected) graph which has
the same vertex set as D and has an edge between two distinct vertices x and y
if and only if there exists a vertex v in D such that (x,v) and (y,v) are arcs
of D. For any graph G, G together with sufficiently many new isolated vertices
is the competition graph of some acyclic digraph. In 1978, F. S. Roberts
defined the competition number k(G) of a graph G as the minimum number of such
isolated vertices. In general, it is hard to compute the competition number
k(G) for a graph G and it has been one of important research problems in the
study of competition graphs to characterize a graph by computing its
competition number.
  It is well known that there exist 5 kinds of regular polyhedra in the three
dimensional Euclidean space: a tetrahedron, a hexahedron, an octahedron, a
dodecahedron, and an icosahedron. We regard a polyhedron as a graph. The
competition numbers of a tetrahedron, a hexahedron, an octahedron, and a
dodecahedron are easily computed by using known results on competition numbers.
In this paper, we focus on an icosahedron and give the exact value of the
competition number of an icosahedron.

interstellar gas in 6 Virgo cluster spiral galaxies a first complete ram
pressure stripping time sequence has been established. The observational
characteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are
presented. The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vectors of the galaxies,
peak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth,
static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the
galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i.e. when the galaxy's
velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center
(M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and
its 3D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear orbital
segments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density
distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure
that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical
simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy
would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived
from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed
by the dynamical models. Compared to NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569, NGC 4388
requires a still 2 times higher local intracluster medium density or a
direction which is moderately different from that derived from the dynamical
model. A possible scenario for the dynamical evolution of NGC 4438 and M 86
within the Virgo cluster is presented.

TC and magnetization increases. Meanwhile, the temperature span of vs. T plot
becomes well broadened with x. Due to the competition between the broadening
temperature span and decreasing, the relative cooling power (RCP) increases
initially, and then decreases with increasing x. The largest RCP (2.1 J/cm3,

operational networks. Hence, protection of communication networks is essential
to increase their reliability, performance, and operations. Much research work
has been done to protect against link and node failures, and to provide
reliable solutions based on pre-defined provision or dynamic restoration of the
domain. In this paper we develop network protection strategies against multiple
link failures using network coding and joint capacities. In these strategies,
the source nodes apply network coding for their transmitted data to provide
backup copies for recovery at the receivers' nodes. Such techniques can be
applied to optical, IP, and mesh networks. The encoding operations of
protection codes are defined over finite fields. Furthermore, the normalized
capacity of the communication network is given by $(n-t)/n$ in case of $t$ link
failures. In addition, a bound on the minimum required field size is derived.

simulations of the cold dark matter model. We calculate the upper limit for the
size of a galactic disk at a specific redshift $z$, based on the orbital
properties of subhalos characterized by their pericentric distances from the
center of a host halo. We find that this possibly largest size of a disk as
determined by the smallest pericentric distances of subhalos shows the
characteristic properties, which are basically in agreement with an observed
galactic disk at low and high $z$. Namely, it is found that a massive disk can
have a larger size than a less massive one, because of its stability against
the destruction effect of subhalos. Also, with fixed mass, the size of a
galactic disk at low $z$ can be larger than that at high $z$, reflecting the
orbital evolution of subhalos with respect to a host halo. These results
suggest that the presence and structure of a galactic disk may be dynamically
limited by the interaction with dark matter substructures, especially at high
$z$.

self-organized criticality without a conservation law, as forest-fires or
earthquake automata, is scrutinized in this paper. By using three different
levels of description - (i) a simple mean field, (ii) a more detailed
mean-field description in terms of a (self-organized) branching processes, and
(iii) a full stochastic representation in terms of a Langevin equation-, it is
shown on general grounds that non-conserving dynamics does not lead to bona
fide criticality. Contrarily to conserving systems, a parameter, which we term
""re-charging"" rate (e.g. the tree-growth rate in forest-fire models), needs to
be fine-tuned in non-conserving systems to obtain criticality. In the infinite
size limit, such a fine-tuning of the loading rate is easy to achieve, as it
emerges by imposing a second separation of time-scales but, for any finite
size, a precise tuning is required to achieve criticality and a coherent
finite-size scaling picture. Using the approaches above, we shed light on the
common mechanisms by which ""apparent criticality"" is observed in non-conserving
systems, and explain in detail (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the
difference with respect to true criticality obtained in conserving systems. We
propose to call this self-organized quasi-criticality (SOqC). Some of the
reported results are already known and some of them are new. We hope the
unified framework presented here helps to elucidate the confusing and
contradictory literature in this field. In a second accompanying paper, we
shall discuss the implications of the general results obtained here for models

thicknesses ranging from a single monolayer to 12 nm, grown on Al2O3, MgO and
SiO2 substrates. Growth and transport measurements were carried out under
cryogenic conditions in UHV. Applying in-plane magnetic vector fields up to 100
mT, the magnetotransport properties are ascertained during growth. With
increasing thickness the films exhibit a gradual transition from tunneling
magnetoresistance to anisotropic magnetoresistance. This corresponds to the
evolution of the film structure from separated small islands to a network of
interconnected grains as well as the transition from superparamagnetic to
ferromagnetic behavior of the film. Using an analysis based on a theoretical
model of the island growth, we find that the observed evolution of the
magnetoresistance in the tunneling regime originates from the changes in the
island size distribution during growth. Depending on the substrate material,
significant differences in the magnetoresistance response in the transition
regime between tunneling magnetoresistance and anisotropic magnetoresistance
were found. We attribute this to an increasingly pronounced island growth and
slower percolation process of Permalloy when comparing growth on SiO2, MgO and
Al2O3 substrates. The different growth characteristics result in a markedly
earlier onset of both tunneling magnetoresistance and anisotropic
magnetoresistance for SiO2. For Al2O3 in particular the growth mode results in
a structure of the film containing two different contributions to the
ferromagnetism which lead to two distinct coercive fields in the high thickness
regime.

structured absorbing configurations (characterized by a background field)
develop around the wall. We study such structures using a mean-field approach
as well as computer simulations. The main results are: i) for systems in the
directed percolation class, a very fast (exponential) convergence of the
background to its bulk value is observed; ii) for systems with a conservation
law, power-law decaying landscapes are induced by both types of walls: while
for absorbing walls this effect is already present in the mean-field
approximation, for reflecting walls the structured background is a
noise-induced effect. The landscapes are shown to converge to their asymptotic
bulk values with an exponent equal to the inverse of the bulk correlation
length exponent. Finally, the implications of these results in the context of
self-organizing systems are discussed.

particle and fermion tunneling. With this corrected Hawking-like temperature,
the explicit expressions of the corrected entropy of apparent horizon for
various gravity theories including Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity,
Lovelock gravity, $f(R)$ gravity and scalar-tensor gravity, are computed. Our
results show that the corrected entropy formula for different gravity theories
can be written into a general expression (\ref{entropy-final}) of a same form.
It is also shown that this expression is also valid for black holes. This might
imply that the expression for the corrected entropy derived from tunneling
method is independent of gravity theory, spacetime and dimension of the
spacetime. Moreover, it is concluded that the basic thermodynamical property
that the corrected entropy on apparent horizon is a state function is satisfied
by the FRW universe.

provides a tool that addresses different issues, such as triggered star

the early phases of planet formation. The Orion complex is a well known example
of possible triggered star formation and is known to host a rich variety of
proto-planetary disks around its low-mass stars. Available metallicity
measurements yield discrepant results. We analyzed FLAMES/UVES and Giraffe
spectra of low-mass members of three groups/clusters belonging to the Orion
association. Our goal is the homogeneous determination of the metallicity of
the sample stars, which allows us to look for [Fe/H] differences between the
three regions and for the possible presence of metal-rich stars. Nine members
of the ONC and one star each in the $\lambda$ Ori cluster and OB1b subgroup
were analyzed. After the veiling determination, we retrieved the metallicity by
means of equivalent widths and/or spectral synthesis using MOOG. We obtain an
average metallicity for the ONC [Fe/H]=-0.01\pm 0.04. No metal-rich stars were
detected and the dispersion within our sample is consistent with measurement
uncertainties. The metallicity of the $\lambda$ Ori member is also solar, while
the OB1b star has an [Fe/H] significantly below the ONC average. If confirmed
by additional [Fe/H] determinations in the OB1b subgroup, this result would
support the triggered star formation and the self-enrichment scenario for the

to search for specific rotational transitions of corannulene (C20H10). We
performed high-resolution spectroscopic measurements and a simulation of the
emission spectrum of UV-excited C20H10 in the environment of the Red Rectangle,
calculating its synthetic rotational spectrum. Based on these results, we
conducted a first observational campaign at the IRAM 30m telescope towards this
source to search for several high-J rotational transitions of (C20H10). The
laboratory detection of the J = 112 <- 111 transition of corannulene showed
that no centrifugal splitting is present up to this line. Observations with the
IRAM 30m telescope towards the Red Rectangle do not show any corannulene
emission at any of the observed frequencies, down to a rms noise level of Tmb =
8 mK for the J =135 -> 134 transition at 137.615 GHz. Comparing the noise level
with the synthetic spectrum, we are able to estimate an upper limit to the
fraction of carbon locked in corannulene of about 1.0x10(-5) relative to the
total abundance of carbon in PAHs. The sensitivity achieved shows that radio
spectroscopy can be a powerful tool to search for polar PAHs. We compare this
upper limit with models for the PAH size distribution, emphasising that small
PAHs are much less abundant than predicted. We show that this cannot be
explained by destruction but is more likely related to the chemistry of their
formation in the environment of the Red Rectangle.

compact source is present in IC 2497 with a brightness temperature in excess of
4E5 K. With the WSRT, we detect a large reservoir of neutral hydrogen in the
proximity of IC 2497. One cloud complex with a total mass of 5.6E9 Msol to the
South of IC 2497, encompasses Hanny's Voorwerp. Another cloud complex is
located at the position of a small galaxy group ~100 kpc to the West of IC 2497
with a mass of 2.9E9 Msol. Our data hint at a physical connection between both
complexes. We also detect HI in absorption against the central continuum source
of IC 2497. Our observations strongly support the hypothesis that Hanny's
Voorwerp is being ionised by an AGN in the centre of IC 2497. In this scenario,
a plasma jet associated with the AGN, clears a path through the ISM/IGM in the
direction towards the nebulosity. The large-scale radio continuum emission
possibly originates from the interaction between this jet and the large cloud
complex that Hanny's Voorwerp is embedded in. The HI kinematics do not fit
regular rotation, thus the cloud complex around IC 2497 is probably of tidal
origin. From the HI absorption against the central source, we derive a lower
limit of 2.8E21 +- 0.4E21 atoms/sqcm to the HI column density. However,
assuming non-standard conditions for the detected gas, we cannot exclude the

the third as a condensation hidden at optical wavelengths (HN), coincident with
the largest lobe in 10 micron emission. We run numerical simulations that take
into account ON, KC and HN and four more clusters, representing the star

strong evaporation and merge in 10-50 Myr. The star-forming arc is scattered in
less than one orbital period, also falling into the center. Simulations also
show that tidal-striping boosts the external shell of the condensations to
their escape velocity. This fact might lead to an overestimation of the mass of
the condensations in kinematical observations with spatial resolution smaller
than the condensations' apparent sizes. Additionally the existence of two ILR

of biomolecules in load bearing biological materials, which have been evolved
with a large extensibility and a high breaking strength beyond their elastic
limit, and introduce an effective biomimetic strategy to enhance fracture
toughness of a structure through an intrinsic to extrinsic (ITE) transition. In
the ITE transition, toughness starts as an intrinsic parameter at the basic
material level, but by designing a protein-like effective stress-strain
behavior the toughness at the system level becomes an extrinsic parameter that
increases with the system size without bound. This phenomenon is demonstrated
through a combination of numerical simulations, analytic modeling and
experiments, and leads to a biomimetic strategy which can be broadly adopted to
enhance fracture toughness in engineering systems.

low densities of Bjerrum pairs, this length scale is well approximated by the

$1/\bar{\kappa}\propto \sqrt{\rho_\mathrm{s}}$ which is significantly larger

the keen competition between these two phases through tuning the SIA and DMI
energies. This leads to a lattice-distortion-induced reorientation of P from a

the non-inertial observer will disagree with the comoving inertial observers
about the size of the diameter of the polygon. In particular, the non-inertial
traveler will observer a Lorentz-like contraction of distances measured
perpendicular to the direction of relative motion. As a result, the traveler

brightness to a temporary minimum at mag 19.5, which lasted less than 4 days,
after which the star recovered to its previous brightness. The final stages of
the outburst were poorly covered. Time resolved photometry during the outburst
revealed no obvious large-scale modulations such as superhumps. Although some
small apparently periodic signals were detected, their significance is
uncertain. Our observations, and those of previous researchers, support V358
Lyr being a dwarf nova and are consistent with it being a member of the WZ Sge
family.

oscillatory behavior of conductance and spin polarization with respect to the
barrier height, which can be tuned by the gate voltage, we especially analyze
the effect of width-dependent band gap and the nature of contacts. The
oscillation of spin polarization in the GNRs with a large band gap is strong in

consistent with models of galactic chemical evolution with no contribution from
AGB stars. The Galactic halo could have been formed from the dissolution of
globular clusters prior to their intermediate mass stars reaching the AGB. The
second population has enhanced Na and Al accompanied by lower O and by higher
26Mg/Mg (~8%), consistent with models which do incorporate ejecta from AGB
stars via normal stellar winds. All the M71 giants have identical [Fe/H],
[Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], [Ti/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] to within sigma = 0.04 dex (10%). We
therefore infer that the timescale for formation of the first generation of
stars we see today in this globular cluster must be sufficiently short to avoid
a contribution from AGB stars, i.e. less than ~0.3Gyr. Furthermore, the Mg
isotopic ratios in the second M71 population, combined with their elemental
abundances for the light elements, demonstrate that the difference must be the
result of adding in the ejecta of intermediate mass AGB stars. Finally we
suggest that the low amplitude of the abundance variations of the light
elements within M71 is due to a combination of its low mass and its relatively
high Fe-metallicity.

of star clusters both in terms of spatial scale and age. Consistently, the
statistical analysis of positions and ages of clusters in the Milky Way disk
strongly suggests that a correlation between the duration of star formation in
a region and its size does exist. The average age difference between pairs of
open clusters increases with their separation as the ~0.16 power. In contrast
and for the Large Magellanic Cloud, Efremov & Elmegreen (1998) found that the
age difference scales with the ~0.35 power of the region size. This discrepancy
may be tentatively interpreted as an argument in support of intrinsically
shorter (faster) star formation time-scales in smaller galaxies. However, if
both the effects of cluster dissolution and incompleteness are taken into
consideration, the average age difference between cluster pairs in the Galaxy
increases with their separation as the ~0.4 power. This result implies that the
characteristic time-scale for coherent, clustered-mode star formation is nearly
1 Myr. Therefore, the overall consequence of ignoring the effect of cluster
dissolution is to overestimate the star formation time-scale. On the other
hand, in the Galactic disk and for young clusters separated by less than three
times the characteristic cluster tidal radius (10 pc), the average age
difference is 16 Myr, which suggests common origin. (Abridged)
