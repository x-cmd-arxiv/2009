superconductors. We adopt a minimal two-band tight-binding model with various
channels of pairing interaction, and derive a set of two-band Bogoliubov-de
Gennes (BdG) equations. The BdG equations are implemented in real space and
then solved self-consistently via exact diagonalization. In the uniform case,
we find that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state is most favorable for a
nearest-neighbor pairing interaction while the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing state
is most favorable for a next-nearest-neighbor pairing interaction. The is
consistent with that reported by Seo {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 101},
206404 (2008)]. We then proceed to study the local electronic structure around
a magnetic vortex core for both $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave and $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave
pairing symmetry in the mixed state. It is found from the local density of
states (LDOS) spectra and its spatial variation that the resonance core states
near the Fermi energy for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry are bound
while those for the $s_{x^2y^2}$-wave pairing symmetry can evolve from the
localized states into extended ones with varying electron filling factor.
Furthermore, by including an effective exchange interaction, the emergent
antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave (SDW) order can suppress the resonance core
states, which provides one possible avenue to understand the absence of
resonance peak as revealed by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment
(STM) by Yin {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 102}, 097002 (2009)].

compressible convection for the surface layers of A-type stars with the ANTARES
code. Spectroscopic indicators for photospheric convective velocity fields show
a maximum of velocities near Teff ~8000 K. In that range the largest values are
measured for the subgroup of Am stars. Thus far, no prognostic model, neither
theoretical nor numerical, is able to exactly reproduce the line profiles of
sharp line A and Am stars in that temperature range. In general, the helium
abundance of A stars is not known from observations. Hence, we have considered
two extreme cases for our simulations: a solar helium abundance as an upper
limit and zero helium abundance as a lower limit. The simulation for the helium
free case is found to differ from the case with solar helium abundance by
larger velocities, larger flow structures, and by a sign reversal of the flux
of kinetic energy inside the hydrogen ionisation zone. Both simulations show
extended shock fronts emerging from the optical surface, as well as mixing far
below the region of partial ionisation of hydrogen, and vertical oscillations
emerging after initial perturbations have been damped. We discuss problems
related to the rapid radiative cooling at the surface of A-type stars such as
resolution and efficient relaxation. The present work is considered as a step
towards a systematic study of convection in A- to F-type stars, encouraged by
the new data becoming available for these objects from both asteroseismological
missions and from high resolution spectroscopy.

correlated with the phase of the 2.1-yr period found in the radial velocity
measurements for this star. We can model the time-dependent asymmetry either as
the orbit of a low-mass companion around the M giant or as an asymmetric, 20%
change in brightness across the M giant. We do not detect a change in the size
of the star during a 3 year monitoring period neither with respect to time nor
with respect to wavelength. We find a spherical dust-shell with an emission

in close orbit could be the physical cause of the pulsation. The combined
effect of pulsation and low-mass companion could explain the behaviour revealed

combines a mean-reverting volatility process and a stochastic conditional
return which reflects nonlinear positive feedbacks and continuous updates of
the investors' beliefs and sentiments. The conditional expected returns exhibit
faster-than-exponential acceleration decorated by accelerating oscillations,
called ""log-periodic power law."" Tests on residuals show a remarkable low rate
(0.2%) of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the
S&P500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly
identifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, in Aug. 1998 and the
ITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests
confirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides
a diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before Oct.
1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4 years
earlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined
LPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the
last two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical
preference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction
with Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals.

wavelength dependence of NIR extinction. Previous studies suggest a power-law
form, with a ""universal"" value of the exponent, although some recent
observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may
exist. We show that a power-law model provides an excellent fit to most NIR
extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly
from sight line-to-sight line. Therefore, it seems that a ""universal NIR
extinction law"" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V)
[=A(V)/E(B-V)] tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which
have been considered ""peculiar"" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V)
values. We show that the power law parameters can depend on the wavelength
interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths
are included. This result implies that extrapolating power law fits to
determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different
functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose
exponent increases with wavelength, has only 2 free parameters, can fit all of
our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and
produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and
commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power law
model, it gives R(V)'s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to
derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 E(K-V)/E(B-V) -
0.79 can estimate R(V) to +/-0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to
show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations.

$n$ distinct integers induce either $n^{1+\epsilon}$ distinct sums of pairs or
that many distinct products, and conjectured a lower bound of $n^{2-o(1)}$.
They further proposed a generalization of this problem, in which the sums and
products are taken along the edges of a given graph $G$ on $n$ labeled
vertices. They conjectured a version of the sum-product theorem for general
graphs that have at least $n^{1+\epsilon}$ edges.
  In this work, we consider sum-product theorems for sparse graphs, and show
that this problem has important consequences already when $G$ is a matching
(i.e., $n/2$ disjoint edges): Any lower bound of the form $n^{1/2+\delta}$ for
its sum-product over the integers implies a lower bound of $n^{1+\delta}$ for
the original Erd\H{o}s-Szemer\'edi problem.
  In contrast, over the reals the minimal sum-product for the matching is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, hence this approach has the potential of achieving lower
bounds specialized to the integers. We proceed to give lower and upper bounds
for this problem in different settings. In addition, we provide tight bounds
for sums along expanders.
  A key element in our proofs is a reduction from the sum-product of a matching
to the maximum number of translates of a set of integers into the perfect
squares. This problem was originally studied by Euler, and we obtain a stronger
form of Euler's result using elliptic curve analysis.

both in physical science and today's philosophy of nature are evaluated. To
this end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important
case study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the
thesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of
particular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with
the spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis'
ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the
so-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the
systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that
contemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above
the spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum
entanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible
physical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of
Humean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It
is concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism,
as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code
of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead
that - due to the undeniable existence of generic non-supervenient relations -
a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an
indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental
level.

orbital in nature, thus confirming 4U 0513-40 as an ultracompact X-ray binary

below 30 minutes, whereas almost all UCXBs in the Galactic field have orbital
periods longer than this. This suggests that the dynamical formation processes
dominate UCXB production in clusters, producing a different orbital period

state vector and an input signal. The problem of state and parameter
reconstruction is viewed within the classical framework of observer design.
This framework offers computationally-efficient solutions to the problem of
state and parameter reconstruction of a system of nonlinear differential
equations, provided that these equations are in the so-called adaptive observer
canonic form. We show that despite typical neural oscillators being locally
observable they are not in the adaptive canonic observer form. Furthermore, we
show that no parameter-independent diffeomorphism exists such that the original
equations of these models can be transformed into the adaptive canonic observer
form. We demonstrate, however, that for the class of Hindmarsh-Rose and
FitzHugh-Nagumo models, parameter-dependent coordinate transformations can be
used to render these systems into the adaptive observer canonical form. This
allows reconstruction, at least partially and up to a (bi)linear
transformation, of unknown state and parameter values with exponential rate of
convergence. In order to avoid the problem of only partial reconstruction and
to deal with more general nonlinear models in which the unknown parameters
enter the system nonlinearly, we present a new method for state and parameter
reconstruction for these systems. The method combines advantages of standard
Lyapunov-based design with more flexible design and analysis techniques based
on the non-uniform small-gain theorems. Effectiveness of the method is
illustrated with simple numerical examples.

spectroscopy from DEEP2, and UV, optical, and near-IR photometry from AEGIS.
The data are coupled with stellar population models and Bayesian SED fitting to
estimate dust-corrected SFRs. In order to probe the dust heating from stellar
populations of various ages, the derived SFRs were averaged over various
timescales--from 100 Myr for ""current"" SFR to 1--3 Gyr for long-timescale SFRs.
These SED-based UV/optical SFRs are compared to total infrared luminosities
extrapolated from 24 mic observations. We find that for the blue, actively star
forming galaxies the correlation between the IR luminosity and the UV/optical
SFR shows a decrease in scatter when going from shorter to longer SFR-averaging
timescales. We interpret this as the greater role of intermediate age stellar
populations in heating the dust than what is typically assumed. This holds over
the entire redshift range. Many so-called green valley galaxies are simply
dust-obscured actively star-forming galaxies. However, there exist 24
mic-detected galaxies, some with L>10^11 L_sun, yet with little current star
formation. For them a reasonable amount of dust absorption of stellar light is
sufficient to produce the observed levels of IR. In our sample optical and
X-ray AGNs do not contribute on average more than ~50% to the mid-IR
luminosity, and we see no evidence for a large population of ""IR excess""

inflationary acceleration in the early universe and the recent mild
acceleration. By introducing the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase of a
boson field, we have been developing a unified model of dark energy (DE) and
dark matter (DM) for the later mild acceleration. In this scenario, two phases
of BEC (=DE) and normal gas (=DM) transform with each other through BEC phase
transition. This unified model has successfully explained the mild acceleration
as an attractor. We extend this BEC cosmology to the early universe without
introducing new ingredients. In this scenario, the inflation is naturally
initiated by the condensation of the bosons in the huge vacuum energy. This
inflation and even the cosmic expansion eventually terminates exactly at zero
energy density. We call this stage as stagflation. At this stagflation era,
particle production and the decay of BEC take place. The former makes the
universe turn into the standard hot big bang stage and the latter makes the
cosmological constant vanishingly small after the inflation. Furthermore, we
calculate the density fluctuations produced in this model, which turns out to
be in the range allowed by the present observational data. We also show that
the stagflation is quite robust and easily appears when one allows negative
region of the potential. Further, we comment on the possibility that BEC
generation/decay series might have continued all the time in the cosmic history
from the inflation to present.

  With the recent advent of fast digital converters it has become possible,
over a wide radio frequency range, to manipulate not only the modulation
properties of any given signal carried by a radio beam, but also the physical
field vectors which make up the radio beam itself. Drawing inferences from
results obtained in optics and quantum communication research during the past
10-15 years, we extract the core information about fields carrying orbital
angular momentum. We show that with this information it is possible to design
an array of antennas which, together with digital receivers/transmitters, can
readily produce, under full software control, a radio beam that carries
electromagnetic orbital angular momentum, a classical electrodynamics quantity
known for a century but so far preciously little utilized in radio, if at all.
This electromagnetic field is then optimized with the help of various antenna
array techniques to improve the radio vector field qualities. By explicit
numerical solution of the Maxwell equations from first principles, using a de
facto industrial standard antenna software package, we show that the field
indeed carries orbital angular momentum, and give a hint on how to detect and
measure orbital angular momentum in radio beams. Finally, we discuss and give
an explanation of what this can be used for and what the future might bring in

purpose of this paper is to establish an explicit stochastic representation for

in a graphical construction dual to that giving rise to polygonal fields. The
proof of our representation formula goes by constructing a martingale
interpolation between the correlation functions of polygonal fields and crop

of the resulting horizontal (resp. vertical) field equations gives rise to a
generalized form of Maxwell equations in which the electromagnetic field is
purely geometric. Some interesting special cases, which reveal the role of the
nonlinear connection in the obtained field equations, are examined. Finally,

a result, we can mix a large number of chaotic signals and one completely
arbitrary signal and later a recipient of this transformed and weighted mixture

generated by various maps which belong to the logistic family. The arbitrary

  Imperial College London (2008)",,,,"hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we investigate the importance of causality in non-perturbative
approaches to quantum gravity. Firstly, causal sets are introduced as a simple
kinematical model for causal geometry. It is shown how causal sets could
account for the microscopic origin of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Holography
and finite entropy emerge naturally from the interplay between causality and
discreteness. Going beyond causal set kinematics is problematic however. It is
a hard problem to find the right amplitude to attach to each causal set that
one needs to define the non-perturbative quantum dynamics of gravity. One
approach which is ideally suited to define the non-perturbative gravitational
path integral is dynamical triangulation. Without causality this method leads
to unappealing features of the quantum geometry though. It is shown how
causality is instrumental in regulating this pathological behavior. In two
dimensions this approach of causal dynamical triangulations has been
analytically solved by transfer matrix methods. In this thesis considerable
progress has been made in the development of more powerful techniques for this
approach. The formulation through matrix models and a string field theory allow
us to study interesting generalizations. Particularly, it has become possible
to define the topological expansion. A surprising twist of the new matrix model
is that it partially disentangles the large-N and continuum limit. This makes
our causal model much closer in spirit to the original idea by 't Hooft than
the conventional matrix models of non-critical string theory.

spectrum is a spectral invariant. In the present paper we describe a group
theoretic condition under which Sunada's method gives manifolds with identical
covering spectra. When the group theoretic condition of our method is not met,
we are able to construct Sunada isospectral manifolds with distinct covering
spectra in dimension 3 and higher. Hence, the covering spectrum is not a
spectral invariant. The main geometric ingredient of the proof has an
interpretation as the minimum-marked-length-spectrum analogue of Colin de
