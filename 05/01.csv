feasibility of studying the brightest microlensing events towards the Galactic
bulge using a small aperture (~10 cm) telescope. We used one of the HAT
telescopes to obtain 151 exposures spanning 88 nights in 2005 of an 8.4x8.4
square degree FOV centered on (l,b) = (2.85, -5.00). We reduced the data using
image subtraction software. We find that such a search method can effectively
contribute to monitoring bright microlensing events, as was advocated.
Comparing this search method to the existing ones we find a dedicated bulge
photometric survey of this nature would fulfill a significant niche at
excellent performance and rather low cost. We obtain matches to 7 microlensing
events listed in the 2005 OGLE archives. We find several other light curves
whose fits closely resemble microlensing events. Unsurprisingly, many periodic
variables and miscellaneous variables are also detected in our data, and we
estimate approximately 50% of these are new discoveries. We conclude by briefly
proposing Small Aperture Microlensing Survey, which would monitor the Galactic
bulge around the clock to provide dense coverage of the highest magnification
microlensing events.

lensing surveys must therefore incorporate dark energy modifications to the

introducing significant bias in their measurements. For the WMAP5 cosmology,
the more accurate power spectrum is more sensitive to dark energy properties,
resulting in a factor of two improvement in dark energy equation of state
constraints. We explore the complementary constraints on dark energy from
future weak lensing and supernova surveys. A space-based, JDEM-like survey
measures the equation of state in five independent redshift bins to ~10%, while
this improves to ~5% for a wide-field ground-based survey like LSST. These

absence of medium effects JEWEL is shown to reproduce jet measurements at LEP.
The collisional energy loss is consistent with analytic calculations, but with
JEWEL we can go a step further and characterise also jet-induced modifications

distinctive modifications of the jet fragmentation pattern, which should allow

electronic structure calculations, yet, no implementations have been reported
capable to perform molecular dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. We propose
here such a continuum approach in a DFT framework, using plane-waves basis sets
and periodic boundary conditions. Our work stems from a recent model designed
for Car-Parrinello simulations of quantum solutes in a dielectric medium [J.
Chem. Phys. 124, 74103 (2006)], for which the permittivity of the solvent is
defined as a function of the electronic density of the solute. This strategy
turns out to be inadequate for systems extended in two dimensions, by
introducing new term in the Kohn-Sham potential which becomes unphysically
large at the interfacial region, seriously affecting the convergence. If the
dielectric medium is properly redefined as a function of the atomic
coordinates, a good convergence is obtained and the constant of motion is
conserved during the molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, a significant
gain in efficiency can be achieved if the simulation box is partitioned in two,
solving the Poisson problem separately for the ""dry"" region using fast Fourier
transforms, and for the solvated or ""wet"" region using a multigrid method.
Eventually both solutions are combined in a self-consistent procedure, and in
this way Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations of solid-liquid
interfaces can be performed at a very moderate computational cost. This scheme
is employed to investigate the acid-base equilibrium at the TiO2-water
interface.

problems. An example of the former is Bayesian CART. In the latter, real-valued
GP output may be utilized for classification via latent variables, which
provide classification rules by means of a softmax function. We formulate a
Bayesian model averaging scheme to combine these two models and describe a
Monte Carlo method for sampling from the full posterior distribution with joint
proposals for the tree topology and the GP parameters corresponding to latent
variables at the leaves. We concentrate on efficient sampling of the latent
variables, which is important to obtain good mixing in the expanded parameter

developing an efficient scheme for handling categorical predictors, which
commonly arise in classification problems. Our proposed classification TGP

sets. We assess performance relative to existing methods and thereby show how
CTGP is highly flexible, offers tractable inference, produces rules that are
easy to interpret, and performs well out of sample.

Each agent
v receives a signal X_v(0)~N(s, 1) where s is an unknown quantity. A natural
iterative way of estimating s is to perform the following procedure. At
iteration t + 1 let X_v(t + 1) be the average of X_v(t) and of X_w(t) among all
the neighbors w of v.
  In this paper we consider a variant of simple iterative averaging, which
models ""greedy"" behavior of the agents. At iteration t, each agent v declares
the value of its estimator X_v(t) to all of its neighbors. Then, it updates
X_v(t + 1) by taking the maximum likelihood (or minimum variance) estimator of
s, given X_v(t) and X_w(t) for all neighbors w of v, and the structure of the
graph.
  We give an explicit efficient procedure for calculating X_v(t), study the
convergence of the process as t goes to infinity and show that if the limit
exists then it is the same for all v and w. For graphs that are symmetric under
actions of transitive groups, we show that the process is efficient. Finally,
we show that the greedy process is in some cases more efficient than simple
averaging, while in other cases the converse is true, so that, in this model,
""greed"" of the individual agents may or may not have an adverse affect on the
outcome.
  The model discussed here may be viewed as the Maximum-Likelihood version of
models studied in Bayesian Economics. The ML variant is more accessible and
allows in particular to show the significance of symmetry in the efficiency of
estimators using networks of agents.

$w=-1$ and nonzero density at the horizon, is also admitted. This extends the
results obtained previously for static, spherically symmetric space-times. A
new feature as compared to spherical symmetry is that higher-order horizons can
exist in the absence of vacuum matter if the horizon is a surface of zero

applied an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the cine EPID images
acquired during the treatment into corresponding classes with the tumor inside

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of the

schemes, prohibiting low complexity systems from using variable rate and/or

introduce a variable-rate (VR) M-PSK modulation scheme, for communications over

choice of the constellation size is based on the signal-plus-noise (S+N)
sampling value rather than on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). It is
analytically shown that S+N can serve as an excellent simpler criterion,
alternative to S/N, for determining the modulation order in VR systems. In this
way, low complexity transceivers can use VR transmissions in order to increase
their spectral efficiency under an error performance constraint. As an
application, we utilize the proposed VR modulation scheme in equal gain

galaxies are dusty. Although the majority of extraplanar gas in the first few
kiloparsecs above the plane of a spiral galaxy is matter that has been expelled
from the thin disk, the feedback-driven expulsion does not destroy dust grains
altogether (and there is not yet any good measure suggesting it changes the
dust-to-gas mass ratio). Direct optical imaging of a majority of edge-on spiral
galaxies shows large numbers of dusty clouds populating the thick disk to
heights z~2 kpc. These observations are likely revealing a cold, dense phase of
the thick disk interstellar medium. New observations in the mid-infrared show
emission from traditional grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
the thick disks of spiral galaxies. PAHs are found to have large scale heights
and to arise both in the dense dusty clouds traced through direct optical
imaging and in the diffuse ionized gas. In this contribution, we briefly
summarize these probes of dust in the thick disks of spiral galaxies. We also
argue that not only can dust can be used to trace extraplanar material that has
come from within the thick disk, but that its absence can be a marker for newly
accreted matter from the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium. Thus,
observations of dust can perhaps provide a quantitative measure of the
importance of ""outflow versus infall"" in spiral galaxies.

from very high redshift (z > 7), such as the recent GRB 090423, to between
0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. In contrast, a significant fraction of the
sample requires large extinction columns (host-frame A_V > 1 mag, with several
events showing A_V > 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominant
cause of the dark GRB phenomenon. We infer that a significant fraction of GRBs
(and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscured
regions. However, the host galaxies of dark GRBs seem to have normal optical

multiple bursts are accompanied by GW emission. We assume that variation in the
time difference between burst electromagnetic emission and potential burst GW
emission is small relative to the GW signal duration, and we time-align GW
excess power time-frequency tilings containing individual burst triggers to
their corresponding electromagnetic emissions. We use two GW emission models in
our search: a fluence-weighted model and a flat (unweighted) model for the most
electromagnetically energetic bursts. We find no evidence of GWs associated
with either model. Model-dependent GW strain, isotropic GW emission energy
E_GW, and \gamma = E_GW / E_EM upper limits are estimated using a variety of
assumed waveforms. The stacking method allows us to set the most stringent
model-dependent limits on transient GW strain published to date. We find E_GW
upper limit estimates (at a nominal distance of 10 kpc) of between 2x10^45 erg
and 6x10^50 erg depending on waveform type. These limits are an order of
magnitude lower than upper limits published previously for this storm and
overlap with the range of electromagnetic energies emitted in SGR giant flares.

nonconservative soliton dynamics in NIMs, such coupled equations are reduced
into generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation. Cross-compensation between the

Chandra observation of Baade's Window (BW), a low extinction region at ~ 4 deg
south of the Galactic Center. The source exhibits large X-ray modulations at a
period of 1028.4 s in the 0.3 - 8 keV band. The X-ray spectral fit with a power
law model shows the integrated spectrum is intrinsically hard (photon index ~
0.44) and moderately absorbed (NH22 ~ 0.15). Quantile analysis reveals that the
modulations in the X-ray flux strongly correlate with spectral changes that are
dominated by varying internal absorption. The X-ray spectrum of the source is
heavily absorbed (NH22 > 1) during the faint phases, while the absorption is
consistent with the field value during the bright phases. These X-ray
properties are typical signatures of IPs. Images taken with the IMACS camera on
the Magellan 6.5m telescope show a faint (V ~ 22), relatively blue object
within the 2 sigma error circle of the Chandra source. If we assume a nominal
range of absolute V magnitude for a cataclysmic variable (MV ~ 5.5-10.5) and
the known reddening in the region, the source would likely be at a distance of
2-10 kpc. The corresponding average Lx would be $6 \times 10^{31} - 10^{33}$
erg s$^{-1}$ in the 2-8 keV band. Assuming the space density of IPs follows the
stellar distribution, which is highly concentrated in the Galactic Bulge, the
source is probably a relatively bright IP belonging to the Galactic Bulge X-ray
population, the majority of which is now believed to be magnetic cataclysmic
variables.

low-rank matrix. Our approach is to pose the inverse problem as an
approximation problem with a specified target rank of the solution. A simple
search over the target rank then provides the minimum rank solution satisfying
a prescribed data approximation bound. We propose an atomic decomposition that
provides an analogy between parsimonious representations of a sparse vector and
a low-rank matrix. Efficient greedy algorithms to solve the inverse problem for
the vector case are extended to the matrix case through this atomic
decomposition. In particular, we propose an efficient and guaranteed algorithm
named ADMiRA that extends CoSaMP, its analogue for the vector case. The
performance guarantee is given in terms of the rank-restricted isometry
property and bounds both the number of iterations and the error in the
approximate solution for the general case where the solution is approximately
low-rank and the measurements are noisy. With a sparse measurement operator
such as the one arising in the matrix completion problem, the computation in
ADMiRA is linear in the number of measurements. The numerical experiments for
the matrix completion problem show that, although the measurement operator in
this case does not satisfy the rank-restricted isometry property, ADMiRA is a
competitive algorithm for matrix completion.

magnetic fields parallel to the basal plane (${\bf H} \perp c$) are examined

Due to the momentum dependent anisotropy of the Zeeman effect induced by the
broken inversion symmetry, the vortex lattice in higher fields generally shows
some unidirectional modulation of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) type
orienting in the plane perpendicular to ${\bf H}$. However, the direction of
the modulation and the lattice structure depend significantly on the underlying
pairing symmetry: When the mixing between spin singlet and triplet pairing
components is negligible, the resulting modulated structure tends to have
reflection symmetry, while the vortex lattice in systems with a significant
singlet-triplet mixing has no reflection symmetry in most cases. The latter
result implying the presence in {\it real} materials of two degenerate
orientations of the lattice structure separated by domain walls may be relevant
to the extremely low magnetic decay rate observed in CePt$_3$Si.

VSX J074727.6+065050 during 2008 January and February. At its brightest the
star reached magnitude 11.4 and this was followed by a slow decline at 0.09
mag/d for 19 days, corresponding to the plateau phase. There was then a rapid
decline at 1.66 mag/d to a temporary minimum at magnitude 16.6 where it stayed
for 2 to 3 days after which there were six remarkable echo outbursts before the
star gradually faded back towards quiescence at ~magnitude 19.5. The overall
outburst amplitude was at least 8 magnitudes and it lasted more than 80 days.
During the plateau phase we observed common superhumps with Psh = 0.06070(6) d,
but the period increased to Psh = 0.06151(5) d coinciding with the end of the
plateau phase and the onset of the rapid decline. This corresponds to a
continuous period change with P^dot = +4.4(9) x 10-5. During the echo outbursts
there was a superhump regime with Psh = 0.06088(49) d. Evidence is presented
which is consistent with the star being a member of the WZ Sge family of dwarf
novae.

evolving regular curves of $\mathbb R^3$ that develop a singularity in finite

perturbations of $\chi_a(t_0,x)$ for a fixed time $t_0$. In particular, their
curvature is not vanishing at infinity, so we are not in the context of known
results of local existence for the binormal flow. Nevertheless, we construct in
this article solutions of the binormal flow with these initial data. Moreover,
these solutions become also singular in finite time. Our approach uses the
Hasimoto transform what leads us to study the long-time behavior of a 1D cubic
NLS equation with time-depending coefficients and small regular perturbations
of the constant solution as initial data. We prove asymptotic completeness for
this equation in appropriate function spaces.

of a simple tight-binding model for transition metals in the region of d-band
filling near the middle of a d-series, the parameters of the model being
designed to mimic molybdenum. The melting properties are calculated for
pressures ranging from ambient to several Mbar. The model is intended to be the
simplest possible tight-binding representation of the two basic parts of the
energy: first, the pairwise repulsion due to Fermi exclusion; and second, the
d-band bonding energy described in terms of an electronic density of states
that depends on structure. In addition to the number of d-electrons, the model
contains four parameters, which are adjusted to fit the pressure dependent
d-band width and the zero-temperature pressure-volume relation of Mo. We show
that the resulting model reproduces well the phonon dispersion relations of Mo
in the body-centred-cubic structure, as well as the radial distribution
function of the high-temperature solid and liquid given by earlier
first-principles simulations. Our free-energy calculations start from the free
energy of the liquid and solid phases of the purely repulsive pair-potential
model, without d-band bonding. The free energy of the full tight-binding model
is obtained from this by thermodynamic integration. The resulting melting
properties of the model are quite close to those given by earlier
first-principles work on Mo. An interpretation of these melting properties is
provided by showing how they are related to those of the purely repulsive
model.

full Stokes, astronomical imaging polarimeter based upon a Division of
Amplitude Polarimeter. It has been developed to resolve extremely rapid
stochastic, millisecond variations in objects such as optical pulsars, RRATs
and magnetic cataclysmic variables. GASP has no moving parts or modulated
components, so the complete Stokes vector can be measured from just one
exposure - making it unique to astronomy. Furthermore the time required for the
determination of the full Stokes vector is limited only by the time resolution
of the detectors used and the incident photon fluxes. GASP utilizes a modified
Fresnel rhomb, which acts as a highly achromatic quarter wave plate and a
beamsplitter (referred to as an RBS). Here we present a description of how the
DOAP works, some of the optical designs for the polarimeter, and give some
preliminary results. Calibration is an important, and difficult issue with all
polarimeters, but particularly in astronomical polarimeters. We give a
description of calibration techniques appropriate to this type of polarimeter,
particularly the Eigenvalue Calibration Method of Compain & Drevillon

Parallel viscosity contributes a radial shear viscous force which may develop

Runge-Kutta methods. Connections to renormalization theory in perturbative
quantum field theory have been established in recent years. The algebraic
structure of classical Runge-Kutta methods is described by the Connes-Kreimer
Hopf algebra. Lie-Butcher theory is a generalization of B-series aimed at
studying Lie-group integrators for differential equations evolving on
manifolds. Lie-group integrators are based on general Lie group actions on a
manifold, and classical Runge-Kutta integrators appear in this setting as the
special case of R^n acting upon itself by translations. Lie--Butcher theory
combines classical B-series on R^n with Lie-series on manifolds. The underlying
Hopf algebra combines the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra with the shuffle Hopf
algebra of free Lie algebras. We give an introduction to Hopf algebraic
structures and their relationship to structures appearing in numerical
analysis, aimed at a general mathematical audience. In particular we explore
the close connection between Lie series, time-dependent Lie series and
Lie--Butcher series for diffeomorphisms on manifolds. The role of the Euler and
Dynkin idempotents in numerical analysis is discussed. A non-commutative

for different frequencies f = 0.1 to 5 MHz of alternating current. The zero
field R, which decreases smoothly around the Curie temperature TC for f = 100

and 800 GeV by the ATIC experiment has - together with the PAMELA detection of
a rise in the positron fraction up to 100 GeV - motivated many interpretations
in terms of dark matter scenarios; alternative explanations assume a nearby
electron source like a pulsar or supernova remnant. Here we present a
measurement of the cosmic-ray electron spectrum with H.E.S.S. starting at 340
GeV. While the overall electron flux measured by H.E.S.S. is consistent with
the ATIC data within statistical and systematic errors, the H.E.S.S. data
exclude a pronounced peak in the electron spectrum as suggested for
interpretation by ATIC. The H.E.S.S. data follow a power-law spectrum with
spectral index of 3.0 +- 0.1 (stat.) +- 0.3 (syst.), which steepens at about 1
TeV.

arising from e-mail exchange, presents social and information scientists with
new possibilities for characterizing individual behavior and, by extension,
identifying latent structure in human populations. Here, we propose a model of
individual e-mail communication that is sufficiently rich to capture meaningful
variability across individuals, while remaining simple enough to be
interpretable. We show that the model, a cascading non-homogeneous Poisson
process, can be formulated as a double-chain hidden Markov model, allowing us
to use an efficient inference algorithm to estimate the model parameters from
observed data. We then apply this model to two e-mail data sets consisting of
404 and 6,164 users, respectively, that were collected from two universities in
different countries and years. We find that the resulting best-estimate
parameter distributions for both data sets are surprisingly similar, indicating
that at least some features of communication dynamics generalize beyond
specific contexts. We also find that variability of individual behavior over
time is significantly less than variability across the population, suggesting
that individuals can be classified into persistent ""types"". We conclude that
communication patterns may prove useful as an additional class of attribute
data, complementing demographic and network data, for user classification and
outlier detection--a point that we illustrate with an interpretable clustering
of users based on their inferred model parameters.

matter via elastic scattering in variants of the minimal supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) with non-universal
supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the Higgs masses, which may be either
equal (NUHM1) or independent (NUHM2). We compare the ranges found in the NUHM1
and NUHM2 with that found in the MSSM with universal supersymmetry-breaking
contributions to all scalar masses, the CMSSM. We find that both the NUHM1 and
NUHM2 offer the possibility of larger spin-independent dark matter scattering
cross sections than in the CMSSM for larger neutralino masses, since they allow
the density of heavier neutralinos with large Higgsino components to fall
within the allowed range by astrophysics. The NUHM1 and NUHM2 also offer more
possibilities than the CMSSM for small cross sections for lower neutralino
masses, since they may be suppressed by scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs masses
that are larger than in the CMSSM.

Specifically, the Virasoro mode L_0 is assumed to be non-diagonalisable,
possessing Jordan blocks of rank two. Moreover, the module is further assumed
to have a highest weight submodule, the ""left module"", and that the quotient by
this submodule yields another highest weight module, the ""right module"". Such
modules, which have been called staggered, have appeared repeatedly in the
logarithmic conformal field theory literature, but their theory has not been
explored in full generality. Here, such a theory is developed for the Virasoro
algebra using rather elementary techniques. The focus centres on two different
but related questions typically encountered in practical studies: How can one
identify a given staggered module, and how can one demonstrate the existence of
a proposed staggered module. The text is liberally peppered throughout with
examples illustrating the general concepts. These have been carefully chosen
for their physical relevance or for the novel features they exhibit.
