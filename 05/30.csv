universe has recently been used to understand the observed population of faint
dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) halo, we explore how well these nearby
objects can probe the epoch of first light. We construct a detailed, physically
motivated model for the MW satellites based on the state-of-the-art Via Lactea
II dark-matter simulations. Our model incorporates molecular hydrogen (H_2)
cooling in low-mass systems and inhomogeneous photo-heating feedback during the
internal reionization of our own galaxy. We find that the existence of MW
satellites fainter than M_V ~ -5 is strong evidence for H_2 cooling in low-mass
halos, while satellites with -5 > M_V > -9 were affected by hydrogen cooling
and photoheating feedback. The age of stars in very low-luminosity systems and
the minimum luminosity of these satellites are key predictions of our model.
Most of the stars populating the brightest MW satellites could have formed
after the epoch of reionization. Our models also predict a significantly larger
dispersion in M_300 values than observed and a number of luminous satellites
with M_300 as low as 10^6 solar masses.

for constraining the nature of dark energy. However, accurate measurement of
galaxy shear is crucial and has been shown to be non-trivial by the Shear
TEsting Programme. Here we demonstrate a fundamental limit to the accuracy
achievable by model-fitting techniques, if oversimplistic models are used. We
show that even if galaxies have elliptical isophotes, model-fitting methods
which assume elliptical isophotes can have significant biases if they use the
wrong profile. We use noise-free simulations to show that on allowing
sufficient flexibility in the profile the biases can be made negligible. This
is no longer the case if elliptical isophote models are used to fit galaxies
made up of a bulge plus a disk, if these two components have different
ellipticities. The limiting accuracy is dependent on the galaxy shape but we
find the most significant biases for simple spiral-like galaxies. The
implications for a given cosmic shear survey will depend on the actual
distribution of galaxy morphologies in the universe, taking into account the
survey selection function and the point spread function. However our results
suggest that the impact on cosmic shear results from current and near future
surveys may be negligible. Meanwhile, these results should encourage the
development of existing approaches which are less sensitive to morphology, as
well as methods which use priors on galaxy shapes learnt from deep surveys.

uniform and non-uniform densities. The power of nearest interferer is used as a
major performance indicator, instead of a traditionally-used total interference
power, since at the low outage region, they have the same statistics so that
the former is an accurate approximation of the latter. This simplifies the
problem significantly and allows one to develop a unified framework for the
outage probability analysis, including the impacts of complete/partial
interference cancelation, of different types of fading and of linear filtering,
either alone or in combination with each other. When a given number of nearest
interferers are completely canceled, the outage probability is shown to scale
down exponentially in this number. Three different models of partial
cancelation are considered and compared via their outage probabilities. The
partial cancelation level required to eliminate the impact of an interferer is
quantified. The effect of a broad class of fading processes (including all
popular fading models) is included in the analysis in a straightforward way,
which can be positive or negative depending on a particular model and
propagation/system parameters. The positive effect of linear filtering (e.g. by
directional antennas) is quantified via a new statistical selectivity
parameter. The analysis results in formulation of a tradeoff relationship
between the network density and the outage probability, which is a result of
the interplay between random geometry of node locations, the propagation path

This has direct applications in intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an
effective form of cancer treatment. We develop three approximation algorithms
for matrices with arbitrarily many rows. Our first two algorithms improve the
approximation factor from the previous best of $1+\log_2 h $ to (roughly) $3/2

guarantee. Our third algorithm improves the approximation factor from $2 \cdot

difference between consecutive elements of a row of the intensity matrix.
Finally, experimentation with these algorithms shows that they perform well

(NNLO) in chiral effective theory. We show that, if energy-dependent contact
terms are employed in the NN potential, the 1S0 phase shift can be obtained by
carrying out two subtractions on the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. These
subtractions use knowledge of the the scattering length and the 1S0 phase shift
at a specific energy to eliminate the low-energy constants in the contact
interaction from the scattering equation. For the J=1 coupled channel, a
similar renormalization can be achieved by three subtractions that employ
knowledge of the 3S1 scattering length, the 3S1 phase shift at a specific
energy and the 3S1-3D1 generalized scattering length. In both channels a
similar method can be applied to a potential with momentum-dependent contact
terms, except that in that case one of the subtractions must be replaced by a
fit to one piece of experimental data.
  This method allows the use of arbitrarily high cutoffs in the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We examine the NNLO S-wave phase shifts for
cutoffs as large as 5 GeV and show that the presence of linear energy
dependence in the NN potential creates spurious poles in the scattering
amplitude. In consequence the results are in conflict with empirical data over
appreciable portions of the considered cutoff range. We also identify problems
with the use of cutoffs greater than 1 GeV when momentum-dependent contact
interactions are employed. These problems are ameliorated, but not eliminated,

Spin observables are associated with the functions on a manifold whose points
are labelled by spin projections and 2-sphere coordinates. The star-product
kernel for such functions is obtained in explicit form and connected with
Fourier transform of characters of SU(2) irreducible representation. The
kernels are shown to be in close relation to the Chebyshev polynomials. Using
specific properties of these polynomials, we establish the recurrence relation
between kernels for different spins. Employing the explicit form of the
star-product kernel, a sum rule for Clebsch-Gordan and Racah coefficients is
derived. Explicit formulas are obtained for the dual tomographic star-product
kernel as well as for intertwining kernels which relate spin-tomographic
symbols and dual tomographic symbols.

cosmology from the perspective of geometrical entities such as expansion rate

properties of spacetime and can be defined not only at the classical and
effective level, but also at an operator level in the quantum theory. From
their behavior in the effective constraint surface and in the effective loop
quantum spacetime, we show that one can severely restrict the ambiguities in
regularization of the quantum constraint and rule out unphysical choices. We
analyze this in the flat isotropic model and the Bianchi-I spacetimes. In the
former case we show that the expansion rate is absolutely bounded only for the
so called improved quantization, a result which synergizes with uniqueness of
this quantization as proved earlier. Surprisingly, for the Bianchi-I spacetime,
we show that out of the available choices, the expansion rate and shear are
bounded for only one regularization of the quantum constraint. It turns out
that only for this choice, the theory exhibits quantum gravity corrections at a
unique scale, and is physically viable.

speed relative to body size on hard ground comparable to high performing
organisms like cockroaches but suffer significant performance loss on flowing
materials like sand. In laboratory experiments we study the performance (speed)
of a small (2.3 kg) six-legged robot, SandBot, as it runs on a bed of granular
media (1 mm poppy seeds). For an alternating tripod gait on the granular bed,
standard gait control parameters achieve speeds at best two orders of magnitude
smaller than the 2 body lengths/s ($\approx 60$ cm/s) for motion on hard
ground. However, empirical adjustment of these control parameters away from the
hard ground settings, restores good performance, yielding top speeds of 30
cm/s. Robot speed depends sensitively on the packing fraction $\phi$ and the
limb frequency $\omega$, and a dramatic transition from rotary walking to slow
swimming occurs when $\phi$ becomes small enough and/or $\omega$ large enough.
We propose a kinematic model of the rotary walking mode based on generic
features of penetration and slip of a curved limb in granular media. The model
captures the dependence of robot speed on limb frequency and the transition
between walking and swimming modes but highlights the need for a deeper
understanding of the physics of granular media.

non-relativistic} Bose gases. At zero temperature, we calculate the bipartite
block entanglement entropy of the system, and find it diverges logarithmically
with the particle number in the subsystem. For finite temperatures, we study
the mutual information between the two blocks. We first analytically study an
infinite-range hopping model, then numerically study a set of long-range
hopping models in one-deimension that exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation. In
both cases we find that a Bose-Einstein condensate, if present, makes a
divergent contribution to the mutual information which is proportional to the
logarithm of the number of particles in the condensate in the subsystem. The
prefactor of the logarithmic divergent term is model dependent.

line-of-sight velocity distribution and absorption line strengths out to four
effective radii (Re) in the early-type galaxies NGC 3379 and NGC 821. With our
newly developed observing technique we can now probe these faint regions in
galaxies that were previously not accessible with traditional long-slit
spectroscopy. We make optimal use of the large field-of-view and high
throughput of the spectrograph: by adding the signal of all ~1400 lenslets into
one spectrum, we obtain sufficient signal-to-noise in a few hours of observing
time to reliably measure the absorption line kinematics and line strengths out
to large radius.
  We find that the line strength gradients previously observed within 1 Re
remain constant out to at least 4 Re, which puts constraints on the merger
histories of these galaxies. The stellar halo populations are old and
metal-poor. By constructing orbit-based Schwarzschild dynamical models we find
that dark matter is necessary to explain the observed kinematics in NGC 3379
and NGC 821, with 30 - 50 per cent of the total matter being dark within 4 Re.
The radial anisotropy in our best-fit halo models is less than in our models
without halo, due to differences in orbital structure. The halo also has an
effect on the Mgb - Vesc relation: its slope is steeper when a dark matter halo
is added to the model.

to display high ionization mid-infrared lines typically associated with AGN.
These Chandra observations provide confirmation for the presence of an AGN in
this galaxy, adding to the growing evidence that black holes do form and grow
in isolated bulgeless disk galaxies. Although the low signal-to-noise ratio of
the X-ray spectrum prevents us from carrying out a detailed spectral analysis
of the nuclear source, the X-ray results, combined with the IR and optical
spectroscopic results, suggests that NGC 3621 harbors a heavily absorbed AGN,
with a supermassive black hole of relatively small mass accreting at a high
rate. Chandra also reveals the presence of two bright sources straddling the
nucleus located almost symmetrically at 20"" from the center. Both sources have
X-ray spectra that are well-fitted by an absorbed power-law model. Assuming
they are at the distance of NGC 3621, these two sources have luminosities of
the order of 1.e39 erg/s, which make them ULXs and suggest that they are black
hole systems. Estimates of the black hole mass based on the X-ray spectral
analysis and scaling laws of black hole systems suggest that the 2 bright
sources might be intermediate mass black holes with M_BH of the order of a few
thousand solar masses. However, higher quality X-ray data combined with
multi-wavelength observations are necessary to confirm these conclusions.

source identified by Wrobel & Laor (2009). It appears to be consistent with a
M_g ~ -21.4 elliptical galaxy, if it is at the QSO redshift. The spectroscopy,
however, shows no spatial offset of the red or blue Balmer line subcomponents.
The companion is thus not the source of either the red or blue broad line
systems; SDSS J153636.22+044127.0 cannot be explained as a chance superposition
of objects, or as an ejected black hole. Over the Delta T=0.75 yr difference
between the rest frame epochs of the present and SDSS spectroscopy, we find no
velocity shift to within 40 km/s, nor any amplitude change in either broad line
system. The lack of a shift can be admitted under the binary hypothesis if the
implied radial velocity is a larger component of the full orbital velocity than
was assumed in our earlier work. A strong test of the binary hypothesis
requires yet longer temporal baselines. The lack of amplitude variations is
unusual for the alternative explanation of this object as a ""double-peaked""
emitter; we further argue that SDSS J153636.22+044127.0 has unique spectral
features that have no obvious analogue with other members of this class.

BEMA test averages were significantly higher for the M&I curriculum than for

organized by subtopic was also compared at one of the universities; M&I
averages were significantly higher in each topic. The results suggest that the
M&I curriculum is more effective than the traditional curriculum at teaching
E&M concepts to students, possibly because the learning progression in M&I
reorganizes and augments the traditional sequence of topics, for example, by
increasing early emphasis on the vector field concept and by emphasizing the

of ten square degrees in the Bootes field of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
using the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope. SDWFS, a Cycle four
Spitzer Legacy project, occupies a unique position in the area-depth survey
space defined by other Spitzer surveys. The four epochs that make up SDWFS
permit -- for the first time -- the selection of infrared-variable and high
proper motion objects over a wide field on timescales of years. Because of its
large survey volume, SDWFS is sensitive to galaxies out to z~3 with relatively
little impact from cosmic variance for all but the richest systems. The SDWFS
datasets will thus be especially useful for characterizing galaxy evolution
beyond z~1.5. This paper explains the SDWFS observing strategy and data
processing, presents the SDWFS mosaics and source catalogs, and discusses some
early scientific findings. The publicly-released, full-depth catalogs contain
6.78, 5.23, 1.20, and 0.96 x 10e5 distinct sources detected to the average

of isolated FIRST radio sources and more than 80% of on-axis XBootes sources

found to cool in the mature and late stages of stratospheric weak vortex
events. A substantial part of the temperature changes are associated with
changes to the tropospheric Northern Annular Mode and North Atlantic
Oscillation pressure patterns. The apparent coupling between the stratosphere
and the troposphere may be of relevance for weather forecasting, but only if
the temporal and spatial nature of the coupling is known. Here we show, using
51 winters of re-analysis data, that the tropospheric temperature development
relative to stratospheric weak polar vortex events goes through a series of
well-defined stages, including geographically distinct cold air outbreaks. At
the inception of weak vortex events, a precursor signal in the form of a strong
high-pressure anomaly is found over Northwest Europe. At the same time,
long-lived and robust cold anomalies appear over Asia and Western Europe. A few
weeks later, near the mature stage of weak vortex events, a shorter-lived cold
anomaly emerges off the east coast of North America.The probability of cold air
outbreaks in different phases of the weak vortex life cycle increases by 40-70
% in four key regions. This shows that the stratospheric polar vortex contains
information that can be used to enhance forecasts of cold air outbreaks.
300-year pre-industrial control runs of 11 state-of-the-art coupled climate
models corroborate our results.

source is relayed by successive multi-antenna relays until it reaches a
multi-antenna destination. Assuming correlated fading at each hop, each relay
receives a faded version of the signal from the previous level, performs linear
precoding and retransmits it to the next level. Using free probability theory
and assuming that the noise power at relaying levels-- but not at destination--
is negligible, the closed-form expression of the asymptotic instantaneous
end-to-end mutual information is derived as the number of antennas at all
levels grows large. The so-obtained deterministic expression is independent
from the channel realizations while depending only on channel statistics.
Moreover, it also serves as the asymptotic value of the average end-to-end
mutual information. The optimal singular vectors of the precoding matrices that
maximize the average mutual information with finite number of antennas at all
levels are also provided. It turns out that the optimal precoding singular
vectors are aligned to the eigenvectors of the channel correlation matrices.
Thus they can be determined using only the known channel statistics. As the
optimal precoding singular vectors are independent from the system size, they
are also optimal in the asymptotic regime.

laws of quantum mechanics. One of the major open questions of quantum mechanics
is what happens if non-commuting observables are measured simultaneously. Since
current operators at different times do not commute, the high-frequency
correlation functions of the current are realization of this fundamental
quantum question. We formulate this problem in the context of measurements of
finite-frequency current cumulants in a general quantum point contact, which
are the subject to ongoing experimental effort. To this end, we present two
models of detectors that correspond to a weak time-resolved measurement of the
electronic current in a mesoscopic junction. In both cases, the backaction of
the detector leads to observable corrections to the current correlations
functions involving the so-called noise susceptibilities. As a result, we
propose a reinterpretation of environmental corrections to the finite-frequency
cumulants as inevitable effect resulting from basic quantum mechanical
principles. Finally we make concrete predictions for the temperature-,
voltage-, and frequency-dependence of the third cumulant, which could be
verified directly using current experimental techniques.

(y's). Often the responses are suspected to share a common underlying
structure, in which case it may be advantageous to share information across
them; this is known as multitask learning. As a special case, we can use
multiple responses to better identify shared predictive features -- a project
we might call multitask feature selection.
  This thesis is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces feature selection
for regression, focusing on ell_0 regularization methods and their
interpretation within a Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. Section 2
proposes a novel extension of MDL feature selection to the multitask setting.
The approach, called the ""Multiple Inclusion Criterion"" (MIC), is designed to
borrow information across regression tasks by more easily selecting features
that are associated with multiple responses. We show in experiments on
synthetic and real biological data sets that MIC can reduce prediction error in
settings where features are at least partially shared across responses. Section
3 surveys hypothesis testing by regression with a single response, focusing on
the parallel between the standard Bonferroni correction and an MDL approach.
Mirroring the ideas in Section 2, Section 4 proposes a novel MIC approach to
hypothesis testing with multiple responses and shows that on synthetic data
with significant sharing of features across responses, MIC sometimes
outperforms standard FDR-controlling methods in terms of finding true positives
for a given level of false positives. Section 5 concludes.

synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons in the hot spot. These
electrons may be able to produce high energy gamma-ray photons through inverse
Compton (IC) scattering. We use single-zone and multi-zone synchrotron +
synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) models to fit the observed spectral energy
distribution (SED) from the radio to the X-ray band of the hot spot. Our esults
show that in the case of a much weaker magnetic field strength than the
equipartition magnetic field, both the single-zone and multi-zone models can
fit the SED, but the multi-zone model significantly improves the fit. The two
models predict the hot spot as a GeV-TeV source, which might be marginally
detectable with Fermi/LAT and HESS. The inverse Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background (IC/CMB) is also considered, but its contribution to
GeV-TeV emission is negligible. Note that under the equipartition condition,
the SED can also be fit with the multi-zone model, but the predicted flux at
10^22 Hz is too weak to be detectable. The detection of TeV gamma-rays from
this FR II radio galaxy, if confirmed, would establish a new subclass of
extragalactic source in this energy regime since most of the AGNs detected to

When applying the ML approach to BSS problems, one usually determines the
analytical expressions of the derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to
the parameters of the considered mixing model. In the literature, these
calculations were mainly considered for linear mixtures up to now. They are
more complex for nonlinear mixtures, due to dependencies between the considered
quantities. Moreover, the notations commonly employed by the BSS community in
such calculations may become misleading when using them for nonlinear mixtures,
due to the above-mentioned dependencies. In this document, we therefore explain
this phenomenon, by showing the effect of indirect dependencies on the
application of the ML approach to the mixing model considered in [1]. This
yields the explicit expression of the complete derivative of the log-likelihood

of the gravitational and scalar-field quasinormal modes of large black holes
and black branes in anti-de Sitter backgrounds. These results are particularly
relevant for the AdS/CFT correspondence, since the eikonal regime is
characterized by the existence of long-lived modes which (presumably) dominate
the decay timescale of the perturbations. We confirm all the main qualitative
features of these slowly-damped modes as predicted by Festuccia and Liu
(arXiv:0811.1033) for the scalar-field (tensor-type gravitational)
fluctuations. However, quantitatively we find dimensional-dependent correction
factors. We also investigate the dependence of the QNM frequencies on the
horizon radius of the black hole (brane) and the angular momentum (wavenumber)
of vector- and scalar-type gravitational perturbations.

evolution of protoplanetary dust. Based on a variety of dust-collision
experiments in the laboratory, our view of the growth of dust aggregates in
protoplanetary disks is now supported by a deeper understanding of the physics
involved in the interaction between dust agglomerates. However, the parameter
space, which determines the collisional outcome, is huge and sometimes
inaccessible to laboratory experiments. Very large or fluffy dust aggregates
and extremely low collision velocities are beyond the boundary of today's
laboratories. It is therefore desirable to augment our empirical knowledge of
dust-collision physics with a numerical method to treat arbitrary aggregate
sizes, porosities and collision velocities. In this article, we implement
experimentally-determined material parameters of highly porous dust aggregates
into a Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, in particular an
omnidirectional compressive-strength and a tensile-strength relation. We also
give a prescription of calibrating the SPH code with compression and
low-velocity impact experiments. In the process of calibration, we developed a
dynamic compressive-strength relation and estimated a relation for the shear
strength. Finally, we defined and performed a series of benchmark tests and
found the agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations to
be very satisfactory. SPH codes have been used in the past to study collisions
at rather high velocities. At the end of this work, we show examples of future
applications in the low-velocity regime of collisional evolution.

necessarily yield its D-1-dimensional analog version. Among other things, this
result will depend on the boundary conditions and the dimension D of the
system. We investigate this question for scalar and abelian gauge fields under
boundary conditions that obey the symmetries of the action. We apply our
findings to the Casimir piston, an ideal system for detecting boundary effects.
Our investigation is not limited to extra dimensions and we show that the
original piston scenario proposed in 2004, a toy model involving a scalar field
in 3D (2+1)dimensions, can be obtained via dimensional reduction from a more
realistic 4D electromagnetic (EM) system. We show that for perfect conductor
conditions, a D-dimensional EM field reduces to a D-1 scalar field and not its
lower-dimensional version. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, no theory is
recovered under dimensional reduction and the Casimir pressure goes to zero in
any dimension. This ""zero Dirichlet"" result is useful for understanding the EM
case. We then identify two special systems where the lower-dimensional version
is recovered in any dimension: systems with perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)
and Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these two boundary conditions can
be obtained from a variational procedure in which the action vanishes outside
the bounded region. The fields are free to vary on the surface and have zero
modes which survive after dimensional reduction.
