classical analysis of the loop quantum black hole (LQBH). We show that the
regular Reissner-Nordstrom-like metric is self-dual in the sense of T-duality:
the form of the metric obtained in Loop quantum Gravity (LQG) is invariant
under the exchange ""r <-> a0/r"" where ""a0"" is proportional to the minimum area
in LQG and ""r"" is the standard Schwarzschild radial coordinate at asymptotic
infinity. Of particular interest, the symmetry imposes that if an observer at
""r"" close to infinity sees a black hole of mass ""m"" an observer in the other
asymptotic infinity beyond the horizon (at ""r"" close to ""0"") sees a dual mass
""mp/m"" (""mp"" is the Planck mass). We then show that small LQBH are stable and
could be a component of dark matter. Ultra-light LQBHs created shortly after
the Big Bang would now have a mass of approximately ""10^(-5) mp"" and emit
radiation with a typical energy of about 10^(13) - 10^(14) eV but they would
also emit cosmic rays of much higher energies, albeit few of them. If these
small LQBHs form a majority of the dark matter of the Milky Way's Halo, the
production rate of ultra-high-energy-cosmic-rays (UHECR) by these ultra light
black holes would be compatible with the observed rate of the Auger detector.

explore black holes in these backgrounds for a range of values of $z$. We find
drastically different behavior for $z>2$ and $z<2$. We find that for $z>2$
($z<2$) the Lifshitz fixed point is repulsive (attractive) when going to larger
radial parameter $r$. For the repulsive $z>2$ backgrounds, we find a continuous
family of black holes satisfying a finite energy condition. However, for $z<2$
we find that the finite energy condition is more restrictive, and we expect
only a discrete set of black hole solutions, unless some unexpected
cancellations occur. For all black holes, we plot temperature $T$ as a function
of horizon radius $r_0$. For $z\lessapprox 1.761$ we find that this curve
develops a negative slope for certain values of $r_0$ possibly indicating a

are observed from the binary system. It is likely that the collision of the
pulsar wind with the anisotropic wind of the Be star plays a crucial role in
the generation of the observed non-thermal emission. The 2007 periastron
passage was observed in unprecedented details with Suzaku, Swift, XMM-Newton
and Chandra missions. We present here the results of this campaign and compare
them with previous observations. With these data we are able, for the first
time, to study the details of the spectral evolution of the source over a 2
months period of the passage of the pulsar close to the Be star. New data
confirm the pre-periastron spectral hardening, with the photon index reaching a
value smaller than 1.5, observed during a local flux minimum. If the observed
X-ray emission is due to the inverse Compton (IC) losses of the 10 MeV
electrons, then such a hard spectrum can be a result of Coulomb losses, or can
be related to the existence of the low-energy cut-off in the electron spectrum.
Alternatively, if the X-ray emission is a synchrotron emission of very high
energy electrons, the observed hard spectrum can be explained if the high
energy electrons are cooled by IC emission in Klein-Nishina regime.
Unfortunately the lack of simultaneous data in the TeV energy band prevents us
from making a definite conclusion on the nature of the observed spectral
hardening and, therefore, on the origin of the X-ray emission.

place in this system depending on the electron filling N_{tot}, or the level
position $\epsilon_d$ of the triple dot. The SU(4) Kondo behavior is seen in
the half-filled case N_{tot} = 3.0 at the dip of the series conductance, and it
causes a charge redistribution between the even and odd orbitals in the

Fermi-liquid ground state acquire a channel symmetry at zero points of the
two-terminal conductance, in the case the system has time-reversal and
inversion symmetries. It causes the SU(4) behavior at low energies, while the
orbital degeneracy in the triangle determines the high-energy behavior. At
four-electron filling N_{tot} = 4.0, a local S=1 moment emerges at high
temperatures due to a Nagaoka ferromagnetic mechanism. It is fully screened by
the electrons from the two conducting channels via a two-stage Kondo effect,
which is caused by a difference in the charge distribution in the even and odd

channel, expressed in an oocyte, gave a maximal increase of 16% at the same
applied magnetic field and membrane depolarization between -14 mV and -7 mV
(see Figure 4). We attribute this resonant behavior to stochastic resonance
between the thermal activations of the configuration of interacting ions in the
I_Ks channel over a low potential barrier inside the closed state of the
channel and the periodic electromotive force induced across the membrane by the
periodic magnetic field. The partial synchronization of the random jumps with
the periodic force changes the relative times spent on either side of the
barrier, thereby changing the open probability of the spontaneously gating open
channel. This, in turn, changes the conductance of the channel at the
particular depolarization level and frequency and is expressed in the
Hodgkin-Huxley equations as a bump at the given voltage in the
conductance-voltage relation. We integrate the modified Hodgkin-Huxley
equations for the current into the Luo-Rudy model of a Guinea pig ventricular
cardiac myocyte and obtain increased conductance during the plateau of the
action potential in the cell. This shortens both the action potential and the
cytosolic calcium concentration spike durations, lowers its amplitude,
increases cytosolic sodium, and lowers cytosolic potassium concentrations. The
shortening of the ventricular calcium signal shortens the QT period of the ECG.

is vital for quantitative understanding of the immune system. Deuterium, in the
form of deuterated glucose or heavy water, can be used to measure rates of
proliferation and death of lymphocytes in vivo. Inferring these rates from
labeling and delabeling curves has been subject to considerable debate with
different groups suggesting different mathematical models for that purpose. We
show that the three models that are most commonly used are in fact
mathematically identical and differ only in their interpretation of the
estimated parameters. By extending these previous models, we here propose a
more mechanistic approach for the analysis of data from deuterium labeling
experiments. We construct a model of ""kinetic heterogeneity"" in which the total
cell population consists of many sub-populations with different rates of cell
turnover. In this model, for a given distribution of the rates of turnover, the
predicted fraction of labeled DNA accumulated and lost can be calculated. Our
model reproduces several previously made experimental observations, such as a
negative correlation between the length of the labeling period and the rate at
which labeled DNA is lost after label cessation. We demonstrate the reliability
of the new explicit kinetic heterogeneity model by applying it to artificially
generated datasets, and illustrate its usefulness by fitting experimental data.
In contrast to previous models, the explicit kinetic heterogeneity model 1)
provides a mechanistic way of interpreting labeling data; 2) allows for a
non-exponential loss of labeled cells during delabeling, and 3) can be used to
describe data with variable labeling length.

Quantum Computation (ADQC) combines aspects of the quantum circuit and the
one-way model to overcome challenging issues in building large-scale quantum
computers. Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal
quantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to
couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By
measuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system
performs the desired logical operations.
  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary
and stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to
standardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the
beginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used
for ADQC. We prove there are only two such classes of interactions
characterised in terms of the non-local part of the interaction operator. This
leads to the definition of a new entanglement resource called twisted graph
states generated from non-commuting operators. The ADQC model is formalised in
an algebraic framework similar to the Measurement Calculus. Furthermore, we
present the notion of causal flow for twisted graph states, based on the
stabiliser formalism, to characterise the determinism. Finally we demonstrate
compositional embedding between ADQC and both the one-way and circuit models
which will allow us to transfer recently developed theory and toolkits of
measurement-based quantum computing directly into ADQC.

operator-ordering choice in quantum cosmology. It is particularly naturally and
simply manifest in relationalist product-type actions (such as the Jacobi
action for mechanics or Baierlein-Sharp-Wheeler type actions for general
relativity), for which all that is required for the kinetic and potential
factors to rescale in compensation to each other. These actions themselves
mathematically sharply implementing philosophical principles relevant to
whole-universe modelling, the motivation for conformal operator-ordering in
quantum cosmology is substantially strengthened. Relationalist product-type
actions also give emergent times which amount to recovering Newtonian, proper
and cosmic time in the various relevant contexts. The conformal scaling of
these actions directly tells us how emergent time scales; if one follows suit
with the Newtonian time or the lapse in the more commonly used difference-type
Euler--Lagrange or Arnowitt--Deser--Misner type actions, one sees how these too
obey a more complicated conformal invariance. Moreover, our discovery of the
conformal scaling of the time involved permits relating how it simplifies

magnetosphere. Model results point to ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs)
from supermassive black holes at about the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) energy
threshold from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to high-energy
photon emissions from stellar mass black holes in ultra-relativistic capillary
jets. The former compares favorably with recent results by the Pierre Auger
Observatory (PAO). The latter compares favorably with gamma-ray burst data from
the High Energy Transient Exporer (HETE) II, {\em Swift} and the Burst and
Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), wherein a finite lifetime of black hole
spin is found to improve the correlation between peak energies and true
energies in gamma-rays. Matched filtering applied to 600 light curves of long
GRBs identifies a process of viscous spin down against matter at the inner most
stable circular orbit. We conclude that long GRBs are spin powered, not
accretion powered, from core-collapse supernovae and merger events such as
GRB060614. Contemporaneous low energy emissions are expected from surrounding
matter in gravitational waves by a pressure driven Papaloizou-Pringle
instability, and more so than in accompanying MeV-neutrinos and magnetic winds.
The latter powers aspherical radio-loud supernovae in collapsars and long

the thin film growth. Monte Carlo simulations are used to grow films and
dynamically track the trajectories of re-emitted particles. We performed
simulations for normal incidence, oblique angle, and chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) techniques. Each deposition method leads to a different dynamic evolution
of surface morphology due to different sticking coefficients involved and
different strength of shadowing effect originating from the obliquely incident
particles. Traditional dynamic scaling analysis on surface morphology cannot
point to any universal behavior. On the other hand, our detailed network
analysis reveals that there exist universal behaviors in degree distributions,
weighted average degree versus degree, and distance distributions independent
of the sticking coefficient used and sometimes even independent of the growth
technique. We also observe that network traffic during high sticking
coefficient CVD and oblique angle deposition occurs mainly among edges of the
columnar structures formed, while it is more uniform and short-range among
hills and valleys of small sticking coefficient CVD and normal angle
depositions that produce smoother surfaces.

quantum discord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit, behaving similarly to

quantum discord is more robust than the entanglement against to decoherence so
that quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord correlations may be more

find that the mechanism that generates the z- fluctuations strongly affects the
cascade power, because it controls the coherence time for interactions between
oppositely directed wave packets at the outer scale. In particular, for fixed

expansion in quantum fluctuations around one of the classical limits. We
explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or
Newtonian limit in the coordinate-momentum representation, (ii) wave or
Gross-Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state
representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the
semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections
appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical
trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how
quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of non-equal time correlation
functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the
phase space methods based on the Wigner-Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh
technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal
product, Bopp operators, and others automatically emerge from the Feynmann's
path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation.

mass reduction (due to the energy loss through gravitational waves) and a
possible black hole recoil (due to asymmetric emission of gravitational
radiation). For the mass reduction case and recoil directed along the disk's
angular momentum, oscillations are induced in the disk which then modulate the
internal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosities. On the other hand, when the
recoil direction has a component orthogonal to the disk's angular momentum, the
disk's dynamics are strongly impacted, giving rise to relativistic shocks. The
shock heating leaves its signature in our proxies for radiation, the total
internal energy and bremsstrahlung luminosity. Interestingly, for cases where
the kick velocity is below the smallest orbital velocity in the disk (a likely
scenario in real AGN), we observe a common, characteristic pattern in the
internal energy of the disk. Variations in kick velocity simply provide a phase
offset in the characteristic pattern implying that observations of such a
signature could yield a measure of the kick velocity through electromagnetic
signals alone.

binaries (EBs).
  Methods. CB-BLS is a recently-introduced algorithm for the detection of
transiting CB planets around EBs.We describe progress in search sensitivity,
generality and capability of CB-BLS, and detection tests of CB-BLS on simulated
data. We also describe an analytical approach for the determination of CB-BLS
detection limits, and a method for the correct detrending of
intrinsically-variable stars.
  Results. We present some blind-tests with simulated planets injected to real
CoRoT data. The presented upgrades to CB-BLS allowed it to detect all the blind
tests successfully, and these detections were in line with the detection limits
analysis. We also correctly detrend bright eclipsing binaries from observations
by the TrES planet search, and present some of the first results of applying
CB-BLS to multiple real light curves from a wide-field survey.
  Conclusions. CB-BLS is now mature enough for its application to real data,
and the presented processing scheme will serve as the template for our future
applications of CB-BLS to data from wide-field surveys such as CoRoT. Being
able to put constraints even on non-detection will help to determine the
correct frequency of CB planets, contributing to the understanding of planet
formation in general. Still, searching for transiting CB planets is still a
learning experience, similarly to the state of transiting planets around single
stars only a few years ago. The recent rapid progress in this front, coupled
with the exquisite quality of space-based photometry, allows to realistically
expect that if transiting CB planets exist - then they will soon be found.

98 spectroscopically-selected galaxy groups at 0.25<z<0.55. We measure accurate
colours for group members and the surrounding field population, statistically
complete above a stellar mass limit of M=1E10 Msun. The overall colour
distribution is bimodal in both the field and group samples; but at fixed
luminosity the fraction of group galaxies populating the red peak is larger, by
20+/-7 per cent, than that of the field. In particular, group members with
early-type morphologies, as identified in HST imaging, exhibit a tight red
sequence, similar to that seen for more massive clusters. We show that
approximately 20-30 per cent of galaxies on the red sequence may be
dust-reddened galaxies with non-negligible star formation and early-spiral
morphologies. This is true of both the field and group sample, and shows little
dependence on near infrared luminosity. Thus, the fraction of bright group
members with no sign of star formation or AGN activity is 54+/-6 per cent. Our
field sample, which includes galaxies in all environments, contains 35+/-3 per
cent of such inactive galaxies, consistent with the amount expected if all such
galaxies are located in groups and clusters. This reinforces our earlier
conclusions, that dense environments at z<0.5 are associated with a premature
cessation of star formation in some galaxies; in particular we find no evidence
for significantly enhanced star formation in these environments. Simple galaxy
formation models predict a quenching of star formation in groups that is too
efficient, overpopulating the red sequence. Attempts to fix this by increasing
the timescale of this quenching equally for all group members distorts the
colour distribution in a way that is inconsistent with observations.

Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions created during inflation can lead to

coefficients are correlated, contrary to the standard assumption. We develop an
adaptation of the line of sight integration method that can be applied to
models where the background energy-momentum tensor is isotropic, but whose
linearized perturbations are anisotropic. We then show how this can be applied
to the cases of cubic and hexagonal symmetry. We compute quantities which show
that such models are indistinguishable from isotropic models even in the most
extreme parameter choices, in stark contrast to models with anisotropic initial
conditions based on inflation. The reason for this is that the dark energy
based models contribute to the CMB anistropy via the inegrated Sachs-Wolfe
effect, which is only relevent when the dark energy is dominant, that is, on
the very largest scales. For inflationary models, however, the anisotropy is
present on all scales.

(BAO) surveys to return the best constraints on the dark energy, building on
Paper I of this series (Parkinson et al. 2007). The survey galaxies are assumed
to be pre-selected active, star-forming galaxies observed by their line
emission with a constant number density across the redshift bin. Star-forming
galaxies have a redshift desert in the region 1.6 < z < 2, and so this redshift
range was excluded from the analysis. We use the Seo & Eisenstein (2007)
fitting formula for the accuracies of the BAO measurements, using only the
information for the oscillatory part of the power spectrum as distance and
expansion rate rulers. We go beyond our earlier analysis by examining the
effect of including curvature on the optimal survey configuration and updating
the expected `prior' constraints from Planck and SDSS. We once again find that
the optimal survey strategy involves minimizing the exposure time and
maximizing the survey area (within the instrumental constraints), and that all
time should be spent observing in the low-redshift range (z<1.6) rather than
beyond the redshift desert, z>2. We find that when assuming a flat universe the
optimal survey makes measurements in the redshift range 0.1 < z <0.7, but that
including curvature as a nuisance parameter requires us to push the maximum
redshift to 1.35, to remove the degeneracy between curvature and evolving dark
energy. The inclusion of expected other data sets (such as WiggleZ, BOSS and a
stage III SN-Ia survey) removes the necessity of measurements below redshift
0.9, and pushes the maximum redshift up to 1.5. We discuss considerations in

application of pressure and transforms to a distorted corundum type or
Rh2O3(II) phase with Pbcn symmetry, in agreement with recent experiments. GGA +
U calculations show the same trend but shift the transition pressures to higher

vicinity of the spin transition pressure and whether the system undergoes spin
transition in the corundum type (HP1) or in the Rh2O3(II) type (HP2) phase, is
still a controversial issue. With a relatively simple, but general, octahedral

that in order to acquire a low spin (LS) state from a high spin (HS) one, the
system does not necessarily need to change the crystal structure. Rather, the
spin transition is a phenomenon that concerns the cation octahedra and the spin
state of the system depends mainly on the value of Voct, which is governed by
two distinct equations of state, separated by a well defined volume gap, for
the HS and LS states respectively. Analysis of the results on the basis of
octahedral volume allows to sum up and bridge the gap between two experimental

considerable attention in connection with quantum measurement, metrology, and
information processing. Since only orthogonal states can be unambiguously
distinguished, a transition from a state to an orthogonal one can be taken as
the elementary step of a computational process. Therefore, such a transition
can be interpreted as the operation of ""flipping a qubit"", and the number of
orthogonal states visited by the system per unit time can be viewed as the
maximum rate of operation.
  A lower bound on the orthogonalization time, based on the energy spread
DeltaE, was found by Mandelstam and Tamm. Another bound, based on the average
energy E, was established by Margolus and Levitin. The bounds coincide, and can
be exactly attained by certain initial states if DeltaE=E; however, the problem
remained open of what the situation is otherwise.
  Here we consider the unified bound that takes into account both DeltaE and E.
We prove that there exist no initial states that saturate the bound if DeltaE
is not equal to E. However, the bound remains tight: for any given values of
DeltaE and E, there exists a one-parameter family of initial states that can
approach the bound arbitrarily close when the parameter approaches its limit
value. The relation between the largest energy level, the average energy, and
the orthogonalization time is also discussed. These results establish the
fundamental quantum limit on the rate of operation of any

by a fit to a simple two-parameter function involving the minimizing potential

a new channel of an independent event produced by the planet itself. The two
populations of planets to be detected through this channel are wide-separation
planets and free-floating planets. Although they appear as similar short
time-scale events, the two populations of planets are widely different in
nature and thus distinguishing them is important. In this paper, we investigate
the lensing properties of events produced by planets with moderately wide
separations from host stars. We find that the lensing behavior of these events
is well described by the Chang-Refsdal lensing and the shear caused by the
primary not only produces a caustic but also makes the magnification contour
elongated along the primary-planet axis. The elongated magnification contour
implies that the light curves of these planetary events are generally
asymmetric and thus the asymmetry can be used to distinguish the events from
those produced by free-floating planets. The asymmetry can be noticed from the
overall shape of the light curve and thus can hardly be missed unlike the very
short-duration central perturbation caused by the caustic. In addition, the
asymmetry occurs regardless of the event magnification and thus the bound
nature of the planet can be identified for majority of these events. The close
approximation of the lensing light curve to that of the Chang-Refsdal lensing
implies that the analysis of the light curve yields only the information about
the projected separation between the host star and the planet.

light-curves (photometric time series data from the astrophysics domain).
Separating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important step
towards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects. Most anomaly
detection methods for time series data assume either a single continuous time
series or a set of time series whose periods are aligned. Light-curve data
precludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair of
light-curves may be out of sync. One may use an existing anomaly detection
method if, prior to similarity calculation, one performs the costly act of
aligning two light-curves, an operation that scales poorly to massive data
sets. This paper presents PCAD, an unsupervised anomaly detection method for
large sets of unsynchronized periodic time-series data, that outputs a ranked
list of both global and local anomalies. It calculates its anomaly score for
each light-curve in relation to a set of centroids produced by a modified
k-means clustering algorithm. Our method is able to scale to large data sets
through the use of sampling. We validate our method on both light-curve data
and other time series data sets. We demonstrate its effectiveness at finding
known anomalies, and discuss the effect of sample size and number of centroids
on our results. We compare our method to naive solutions and existing time
series anomaly detection methods for unphased data, and show that PCAD's
reported anomalies are comparable to or better than all other methods. Finally,
astrophysicists on our team have verified that PCAD finds true anomalies that
might be indicative of novel astrophysical phenomena.

  Our main result is a separation between these two models. We show that all
truthful mechanisms, even randomized, achieve a diminishing fraction of the
optimal social welfare (namely, no better than a Omega(loglog n) approximation)

standard monotone hazard-rate condition, we present a truthful mechanism that

Collider (RHIC) that the yield of neutral pions at high transverse momentum

collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. This suppression is
considered to be due to the energy lost by hard scattered partons in the medium
(jet quenching), which results in a decrease of the yield at a given pT.
  The magnitude of the suppression depends on the path length of scattered
partons in the medium. Studying the path length dependence of energy loss
should provide additional information on the energy loss mechanism in the
medium. For example, some theoretical models suggest that the LPM effect in
Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) plays an important role in radiative energy loss
and predict that the magnitude of the energy loss is proportional to square of
path length. We can estimate the path length by measuring the azimuthal angle
from reaction plane and mapping it into the shape of the participant region,
which can be calculated by Glauber model for each impact parameter

RHIC-Year7 Au+Au run is 813 $\mu$b^{-1}, which is 3.5 times larger statistics
than that in RHIC-Year4 Au+Au run. Additionally, a new detector was installed
to determine reaction plane more precisely. This detector is expected to
provide better resolution for reaction plane determination. These advantages
enable us to precisely measure the path length dependence of neutral pion
suppression and discuss parton energy loss mechanism more thoroughly.

  MIMO Systems",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the design of a decentralized multiuser multi-antenna
(MIMO) system for spectrum sharing over a fixed narrow band, where the
coexisting users independently update their transmit covariance matrices for
individual transmit-rate maximization via an iterative manner. This design
problem was usually investigated in the literature by assuming that each user
treats the co-channel interference from all the other users as additional
(colored) noise at the receiver, i.e., the conventional single-user decoder
(SUD) is applied. This paper proposes a new decoding method for the
decentralized multiuser MIMO system, whereby each user opportunistically
cancels the co-channel interference from some or all of the other users via
applying multiuser detection techniques, thus termed opportunistic multiuser
detection (OMD). This paper studies the optimal transmit covariance design for
users' iterative maximization of individual transmit rates with the proposed
OMD, and demonstrates the resulting capacity gains in decentralized multiuser
MIMO systems against the conventional SUD.

  Cognitive Radios by Exploiting Hidden Primary Radio Feedback","accepted in IEEE Transactions on Communications, June 2010",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the wireless spectrum sharing between a pair of
distributed primary radio (PR) and cognitive radio (CR) links. Assuming that
the PR link adapts its transmit power and/or rate upon receiving an
interference signal from the CR and such transmit adaptations are observable by
the CR, this results in a new form of feedback from the PR to CR, refereed to
as hidden PR feedback, whereby the CR learns the PR's strategy for transmit
adaptations without the need of a dedicated feedback channel from the PR. In
this paper, we exploit the hidden PR feedback to design new learning and
transmission schemes for spectrum sharing based CRs, namely active learning and
supervised transmission. For active learning, the CR initiatively sends a
probing signal to interfere with the PR, and from the observed PR transmit
adaptations the CR estimates the channel gain from its transmitter to the PR
receiver, which is essential for the CR to control its interference to the PR
during the subsequent data transmission. This paper proposes a new transmission
protocol for the CR to implement the active learning and the solutions to deal
with various practical issues for implementation, such as time synchronization,
rate estimation granularity, power measurement noise, and channel variation.
Furthermore, with the acquired knowledge from active learning, the CR designs a
supervised data transmission by effectively controlling the interference powers
both to and from the PR, so as to achieve the optimum performance tradeoffs for
the PR and CR links. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed schemes for CRs under different system setups.

non-thermal velocities in moss in an active region core observed by the EUV
Imaging Spectrometer on Hinode in 2007, June. The measurements are derived from
spectral profiles of the Fe 12 195A line. Using the 2"" slit, we repeatedly
scanned 150"" by 150"" in a few mins. This is the first time it has been possible
to make such velocity measurements in the moss, and the data presented are the
highest cadence spatially resolved maps of moss Doppler and non-thermal
velocities ever obtained in the corona. The observed region produced numerous
C- and M- class flares with several occurring in the core close to the moss.
The magnetic field was therefore clearly changing in the active region core, so
we ought to be able to detect dynamic signatures in the moss if they exist. Our
measurements of moss intensities agree with previous studies in that a less
than 15% variability is seen over a period of 16 hours. Our new measurements of
Doppler and non-thermal velocities reveal no strong flows or motions in the
moss, nor any significant variability in these quantities. The results confirm
that moss at the bases of high temperature coronal loops is heated
quasi-steadily. They also show that quasi-steady heating can contribute
significantly even in the core of a flare productive active region. Such
heating may be impulsive at high frequency, but if so it does not give rise to
large flows or motions.

new class of ""ring-like"" methanol masers in star--forming regions appeared to

that methanol masers originate in the disc or torus around a proto- or a young

outflow or infall. This suggests that they form at the interface between the
disc/torus and a flow. This is also strongly supported by Spitzer results

Einstein gravity is usually considered, where R is the Ricci scalar. This

However, if the 1/R term is inflaton-dependent, it will dramatically change the
story of inflation. The entropy perturbation will naturally appear and drive
the evolution of curvature perturbation outside the Hubble horizon. In a large
class of models, the entropy perturbation can be made nearly scale-invariant.
In Einstein gravity the single-field inflation with a quartic potential has
been ruled out by recent observations, but it revives when the 1/R term is
turned on. The evolution of non-Gaussianities on large scale are also studied

for which accurate orbital periods have been measured. 92 of these systems are
new discoveries from SDSS and were followed-up in more detail over the past few
years. 45 systems were previously identified as CVs because of the detection of
optical outbursts and/or X-ray emission, and subsequently re-identified from
the SDSS spectroscopy. The period distribution of the SDSS CVs differs
dramatically from that of all the previously known CVs, in particular it
contains a significant accumulation of systems in the orbital period range
80--86 min. We identify this feature as the elusive ""period minimum spike""
predicted by CV population models, which resolves a long-standing discrepancy
between compact binary evolution theory and observations. We show that this
spike is almost entirely due to the large number of CVs with very low accretion
activity identified by SDSS. The optical spectra of these systems are dominated
by emission from the white dwarf photosphere, and display little or no
spectroscopic signature from the donor stars, suggesting very low-mass
companion stars. We determine the average absolute magnitude of these
low-luminosity CVs at the period minimum to be <M_g>=11.6+-0.7. Comparison of
the SDSS CV sample to the CVs found in the Hamburg Quasar Survey and the
Palomar Green Survey suggests that the depth of SDSS is the key ingredient

0024+17. The basic aim is to find the scales where galaxies present a
significant deviation from an inhomogeneous Poisson statistical process. Using
the generalization of the Ripley, Besag, and the pair correlation functions for
non-stationary point patterns, I estimate these transition scales for a set of
1,000 Monte Carlo realizations of the Cl 0024+17 field, corrected for
completeness up to the outskirts. The results point out the presence of at
least two physical scales in this field at 31.4 and 112.9 arcseconds. The
second one is statistically consistent with the dark matter ring radius (about
75 arcseconds) previously identified by Jee et al. (2007). However, morphology
and anisotropy tests point out that a clump at about 120 arcseconds NW from the
cluster center could be the responsible for the second transition scale. These
results do not indicate the existence of a galaxy counterpart of the dark
matter ring, but the methodology developed to study the galaxy field as a
spatial point pattern provides a good statistical evaluation of the physical
scales around the cluster. I briefly discuss the usefulness of this approach to
probe features in galaxy distribution and N-body dark matter simulation data.

a procedure designed to produce a cell complex from a graph and show that, for

protein interactions network. Two distinct sources contribute to the noise in
such a system: intrinsic noise, inherent in the studied reactions, and
extrinsic noise generated in other parts of the network or in the environment.
We study the effect of extrinsic noise entering the system through a nonlinear
uptake reaction which acts as a nonlinear filter. Varying input noise intensity
varies the mean of the noise after the passage through the filter, which
changes the stability properties of the system. The steady-state displacement
due to small noise is independent on the kinetics of the system but it only
depends on the nonlinearity of the input function.
  For monotonically increasing and concave input functions such as the
Michaelis-Menten uptake rate, we give a simple argument based on the
small-noise expansion, which enables qualitative predictions of the
steady-state displacement only by inspection of experimental data: when weak
and rapid noise enters the system through a Michaelis-Menten reaction, then the
graph of the system's steady states vs. the mean of the input signal always
shifts to the right as noise intensity increases.
  We test the predictions on two models of lac operon, where TMG/lactose uptake
is driven by a Michaelis-Menten enzymatic process. We show that as a
consequence of the steady state displacement due to fluctuations in
extracellular TMG/lactose concentration the lac switch responds in an
asymmetric manner: as noise intensity increases, switching off lactose
metabolism becomes easier and switching it on becomes more difficult.

ordered sets, that is sets endowed with two partial orders. On $\BZ\mathbf D$
we define a product and a coproduct, together with an internal product, that
is, degree-preserving. With these operations $\BZ\mathbf D$ is a Hopf algebra,
self-dual with respect to a scalar product which counts the number of pictures
(in the sense of Zelevinsky) between two double posets. The product and
coproduct correspond respectively to disjoint union of posets and to a natural
decomposition of a poset into order ideals. Restricting to special double
posets (meaning that the second order is total), we obtain a notion equivalent
to Stanley's labelled posets, and obtain a sub-Hopf-algebra already considered
by Blessenohl and Schocker. The mapping which maps each double poset onto the
sum of the linear extensions of its first order, identified via its second
(total) order with permutations, is a Hopf algebra homomorphism, which is
isometric and preserves the internal product, onto the Hopf algebra of
permutations, previously considered by the two authors. Finally, the scalar
product between any special double poset and double posets naturally associated
to integer partitions is described by an extension of the Littlewood-Richardson
rule.

undergo dramatic changes induced by large biases. In magnetite, Fe$_3$O$_4$,
below the Verwey temperature, an electric field driven transition to a state of
lower resistance was recently found, with hysteretic current-voltage response.
We report the results of pulsed electrical conduction measurements in epitaxial
magnetite thin films. We show that while the high- to low-resistance transition
is driven by electric field, the hysteresis observed in $I-V$ curves results
from Joule heating in the low resistance state. The shape of the hysteresis
loop depends on pulse parameters, and reduces to a hysteresis-free ""jump"" of

results with those of previous surveys, we have found a significant variation
of the NH$_{3}$/CCS ratio among dark cloud cores and among molecular cloud

carbon-chain molecules. For instance, the NH$_{3}$/CCS ratios are higher and
the detection rates of carbon-chain molecules are lower in the Ophiuchus cores
