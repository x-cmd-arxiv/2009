the presence of shear there is also an additional magnetic helicity flux
associated with the mean field, but this flux does not alleviate catastrophic

shown that unphysical behavior emerges if the small-scale magnetic helicity

profoundly advanced our understanding of nature. Traditionally, the most widely
used schemes for 3D structure determination of an object are implemented by
acquiring multiple measurements over various sample orientations, as in the
case of crystallography and tomography (1,2), or by scanning a series of thin
sections through the sample, as in confocal microscopy (3). Here we present a
3D imaging modality, termed ankylography (derived from the Greek words ankylos
meaning 'curved' and graphein meaning 'writing'), which enables complete 3D
structure determination from a single exposure using a monochromatic incident
beam. We demonstrate that when the diffraction pattern of a finite object is
sampled at a sufficiently fine scale on the Ewald sphere, the 3D structure of
the object is determined by the 2D spherical pattern. We confirm the
theoretical analysis by performing 3D numerical reconstructions of a sodium
silicate glass structure at 2 Angstrom resolution and a single poliovirus at 2
- 3 nm resolution from 2D spherical diffraction patterns alone. Using
diffraction data from a soft X-ray laser, we demonstrate that ankylography is
experimentally feasible by obtaining a 3D image of a test object from a single
2D diffraction pattern. This approach of obtaining complete 3D structure
information from a single view is anticipated to find broad applications in the
physical and life sciences. As X-ray free electron lasers (X-FEL) and other
coherent X-ray sources are under rapid development worldwide, ankylography
potentially opens a door to determining the 3D structure of a biological
specimen in a single pulse and allowing for time-resolved 3D structure
determination of disordered materials.

very detailed chemical evolution model for the Milky Way which follows the
evolution of several chemical species. We test the single degenerate and the
double degenerate models for supernova Ia progenitors, as well as other more
empirical models based on differences in the time delay distributions. We find
that assuming the single degenerate or the double degenerate scenario produces
negligible differences in the predicted [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation. On the
other hand, assuming a percentage of prompt (exploding in the first 100 Myr)
Type Ia supernovae of 50%, or that the maximum Type Ia rate is reached after
3-4 Gyr from the beginning of star formation, as suggested by several authors,
produces more noticeable effects on the [O/Fe] trend. However, given the spread
still existing in the observational data no model can be firmly excluded on the
basis of only the [O/Fe] ratios. On the other hand, when the predictions of the
different models are compared with the G-dwarf metallicity distribution, the
scenarios with very few prompt Type Ia supernovae can be excluded. Models
including the single degenerate or double degenerate scenario with a percentage
of 10-13% of prompt Type Ia supernovae produce results in very good agreement
with the observations. A fraction of prompt Type Ia supernovae larger than 30%
worsens the agreement with observations and the same occurs if no prompt Type
Ia supernovae are allowed. In particular, two empirical models for the Type Ia
SN progenitors can be excluded: the one without prompt Type Ia supernovae and
the one assuming delay time distribution going like t^{-0.5}.

temperature. The one-dimensional simulation direction is orthogonal to the beam
velocity vector. The magnetic field grows spontaneously and rearranges the
particles in space, such that the distributions of the electrons of one beam
and the positrons of the second beam match. The simulation demonstrates that as
a result no electrostatic field is generated by the magnetic field through its
magnetic pressure gradient prior to its saturation. This electrostatic field
would be repulsive at the centres of the filaments and limit the maximum charge
and current density. The filaments of electrons and positrons in this
simulation reach higher charge and current densities than in one with no
positrons. The oscillations of the magnetic field strength induced by the
magnetically trapped particles result in an oscillatory magnetic pressure
gradient force. The latter interplays with the statistical fluctuations in the
particle density and it probably enforces a charge separation, by which
electrostatic waves grow after the filamentation instability has saturated.

top quark decays, we calculate the top quark mass for each event with two

quarks decaying to $Zc$. For additional background discrimination we require at
least one jet to be identified as originating from a $b$-quark. No significant
signal is found and we set an upper limit on the FCNC branching ratio
$Br({t\goes Zc})$ using a likelihood constructed from the ${\ell\ell cjjb}$ top
quark mass distribution and the number of ${\ell\nu bjjb}$ events. Limits are
set as a function of the helicity of the $Z$ boson produced in the FCNC decay.
For 100% longitudinally polarized $Z$ bosons we find limits of 8.3% and 9.3%

Brownian motion. We introduce a new stochastic process called Riemann-Liouville
step fractional Brownian motion which can be regarded as a special case of
multifractional Brownian motion with step function type of Hurst exponent
tailored for single-file diffusion. Such a step fractional Brownian motion can
be obtained as solution of fractional Langevin equation with zero damping.
Various types of fractional Langevin equations and their generalizations are
then considered to decide whether their solutions provide the correct
description of the long and short time behaviors of single-file diffusion. The
cases where dissipative memory kernel is a Dirac delta function, a power-law

In addition to the case where the short time behavior of single-file diffusion
behaves as normal diffusion, we also consider the possibility of the process

suggest coexistence of majority tetragonally distorted weak antiferromagnetic
phase and minority nonmagnetic cubic phase. Within the local (spin) density
approximation (L(S)DA) our calculations confirm that a slightly tetragonally
distorted phase indeed is energetically favored. Using the correlated band
theory method (LDA+ Hubbard U) as seems to be justified by the unusual behavior
observed in SrCrO$_3$, above the critical value $U_c$=4 eV only the distorted
phase undergoes an orbital-ordering transition, resulting in $t_{2g}^2 -->
d_{xy}^1$($d_{xz}d_{yz}$)$^1$ corresponding to the filling of the $d_{xy}$
orbital but leaving the other two degenerate. The Fermi surfaces of the cubic
phase are simple with nesting features, although the nesting wavevectors do not
correlate with known data. This is not uncommon in perovskites; the strongly
directional d-d bonding often leads to boxlike Fermi surfaces, and either the
nesting is not strong enough, or the matrix elements are not large enough, to
promote instabilities. Fixed spin moment calculations indicate the cubic
structure is just beyond a ferromagnetic Stoner instability (IN(0)~1.1) in
L(S)DA, and that the energy is unusually weakly dependent on the moment out to
1.5$\mu_B$/Cr (varying only by 11 meV/Cr), reflecting low energy
long-wavelength magnetic fluctuations. We observe that this system shows strong
magneto-phonon coupling (change in Cr local moment is ~7.3 $\mu_B$/\AA) for
breathing phonon modes.

collide with the radiation pressure driven shell. The collision imparts renewed

Rayleigh-Taylor unstable, fragmenting the shell. We show that the speed of

expansion in the non-compact directions. It is shown that the {\ae}ther field
can reduce the influence of the Casimir force and slow down the oscillation of
the radion field. This property proves crucial to the stability of the extra
dimension in the universe where non-relativistic matter is present. We
speculate that this scenario might reveal a hidden connection between the
dimensionality of spacetime and the spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry.

provided spectra of several candidate DB-gap stars. First analyses based on
model spectra calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamic

performed an unbiased search for flux ratios which correlate with SN Ia
luminosity. After developing the method and selecting the best ratios from a
training sample, we verified the results on a separate validation sample and
with data from the literature. We identified multiple flux ratios whose
correlations with luminosity are stronger than those of light curve shape and
color, previously identified spectral feature ratios, or equivalent width
measurements. In particular, the flux ratio R(642/443) = F(642 nm) / F(443 nm)
has a correlation of 0.95 with SN Ia absolute magnitudes. Using this single
ratio as a correction factor produces a Hubble diagram with a residual scatter
standard deviation of 0.125 +- 0.011 mag, compared with 0.161 +- 0.015 mag when
fit with the SALT2 light curve shape and color parameters x1 and c. The ratio
R(642/443) is an effective correction factor for both extrinsic dust reddening
and instrinsic variations such as those of SN 1991T-like and SN 1999aa-like
SNe. When combined with broad-band color measurements, spectral flux ratios can
standardize SN Ia magnitudes to ~0.12 mag. These are the first spectral metrics
that improve over the standard normalization methods based upon light curve
shape and color and they provide among the lowest scatter Hubble diagrams ever
published.

to the energy density) allows us to express this solution in analytical terms.
The result can be used both to construct and test numerical schemes for
relativistic Euler equations in (3 + 1) dimensions.

the ideal induction equation in the SPH part of the Vine code. Results from a

by Euler potentials, which pose a div(B)-free description, an constraint not
fulfilled for the direct implementation. All simulations are compared to an

cleaning methods for div(B).
  Starting with a homogeneous seed field we find that by differential rotation
and spiral structure formation of the disc the field is amplified by one order
of magnitude within five rotation periods of the disc. The amplification is
stronger for higher numerical resolution. Moreover, we find a tight connection
of the magnetic field structure to the density pattern of the galaxy in our
simulations, with the magnetic field lines being aligned with the developing
spiral pattern of the gas. Our simulations clearly show the importance of
non-axisymmetry for the evolution of the magnetic field.

any term (whether open or closed, $\beta$-normalising or not) has type
$\omega$. We provide this type system with a realisability semantics where an
atomic type is interpreted as the set of $\lambda$-terms saturated by a certain
relation. The variation of the saturation relation gives a number of
interpretations to each type. We show the soundness and completeness of our
semantics and that for different notions of saturation (based on weak head
reduction and normal $\beta$-reduction) we obtain the same interpretation for
types. Since the presence of $\omega$ prevents typability and realisability
from coinciding and creates extra difficulties in characterizing the
interpretation of a type, we define a class ${\mathbb U}^+$ of the so-called
positive types (where $\omega$ can only occur at specific positions). We show
that if a term inhabits a positive type, then this term is $\beta$-normalisable
and reduces to a closed term. In other words, positive types can be used to
represent abstract data types. The completeness theorem for ${\mathbb U}^+$
becomes interesting indeed since it establishes a perfect equivalence between
typable terms and terms that inhabit a type. In other words, typability and
realisability coincide on ${\mathbb U}^+$. We give a number of examples to
explain the intuition behind the definition of ${\mathbb U}^+$ and to show that
this class cannot be extended while keeping its desired properties.

nucleus size or the elongation time (the time required for a nucleated partial

properties of dark matter and dark energy. To fully utilize its potential, one
has to be able to control systematic effects down to below the level of the
statistical parameter errors. Particularly worrisome in this respect is
intrinsic alignment, causing considerable parameter biases via correlations
between the intrinsic ellipticities of galaxies and the gravitational shear,
which mimic lensing. In an earlier work we have proposed a nulling technique
that downweights this systematic, only making use of its well-known redshift
dependence. We assess the practicability of nulling, given realistic conditions
on photometric redshift information. For several simplified intrinsic alignment
models and a wide range of photometric redshift characteristics we calculate an
average bias before and after nulling. Modifications of the technique are
introduced to optimize the bias removal and minimize the information loss by
nulling. We demonstrate that one of the presented versions is close to optimal
in terms of bias removal, given high quality of photometric redshifts. For
excellent photometric redshift information, i.e. at least 10 bins with a small
dispersion, a negligible fraction of catastrophic outliers, and precise
knowledge about the redshift distributions, one version of nulling is capable
of reducing the shear-intrinsic ellipticity contamination by at least a factor
of 100. Alternatively, we describe a robust nulling variant which suppresses
the systematic signal by about 10 for a very broad range of photometric
redshift configurations. Irrespective of the photometric redshift quality, a
loss of statistical power is inherent to nulling, which amounts to a decrease
of the order 50% in terms of our figure of merit.

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shannon in his 1949 paper suggested the use of derivatives to increase the
W*T product of the sampled signal. Use of derivatives enables improved
reconstruction particularly in the case of non-uniformly sampled signals. An
FM-AM representation for Lagrange/Hermite type interpolation and a
reconstruction technique are discussed. The representation using a product of a
polynomial and exponential of a polynomial is extensible to two dimensions.
  When the directly available information is inadequate, estimation of the
signal and its derivative based on the correlation characteristics of Gaussian
filtered noise has been studied. This requires computation of incomplete normal
integrals. Reduction methods for reducing multivariate normal variables include
multistage partitioning, dynamic path integral and Hermite expansion for
computing the probability integrals necessary for estimating the mean of the
signal and its derivative at points intermediate between zero or threshold
crossings. The signals and their derivatives as measured or estimated are
utilized to reconstruct the signal at a desired sampling rate.

giant molecular cloud have revealed that, within a star forming region, stars
do not form evenly distributed throughout this region, but rather in small
sub-clumps. It is generally believed that these sub-clumps merge and form a
young star cluster. The time-scale of this merging process is crucial for the
evolution and the possible survival of the final star cluster. The key issue is
whether this merging process happens faster than the time needed to remove the
residual gas of the cloud. A merging time-scale shorter than the gas-removal
time would enhance the survival chances of the resulting star cluster. In this
paper we show by means of numerical simulations that the time-scale of the
merging is indeed very fast. Depending on the details of the initial sub-clump
distribution, the merging may occur before the gas is expelled from the
newly-formed cluster either via supernovae or the winds from massive stars. Our
simulations further show that the resulting merger-objects have a higher
effective star formation efficiency than the overall star forming region and
confirm the results that mass-segregated sub-clumps form mass-segregated
merger-objects.

elastic deformation of porous solids on the adsorption process. With p+-type
porous silicon formed on highly boron doped (100) Si single crystal, we can
make identical porous layers, either supported by or detached from the
substrate. The pores are perpendicular to the substrate. The adsorption
isotherms corresponding to these two layers are distinct. In the region
preceding capillary condensation, the adsorbed amount is lower for the membrane
than for the supported layer and the hysteresis loop is observed at higher
pressure. We attribute this phenomenon to different elastic strains undergone
by the two layers during the adsorption process. For the supported layer, the
planes perpendicular to the substrate are constrained to have the same
interatomic spacing as that of the substrate so that the elastic deformation is
unilateral, at an atomic scale, and along the pore axis. When the substrate is
removed, tridimensional deformations occur and the porous system can find a new
configuration for the solid atoms which decreases the free energy of the system
adsorbate-solid. This results in a decrease of the adsorbed amount and in an
increase of the condensation pressure. The isotherms for the supported porous
layers shift toward that of the membrane when the layer thickness is increased
from 30 to 100 microns. This is due to the relaxation of the stress exerted by
the substrate as a result of the breaking of Si-Si bonds at the interface
between the substrate and the porous layer. The membrane is the relaxed state
of the supported layer.

philosophical point of view. It is justified the opinion that the philosophical
attitude the Copenhagen interpretation is based on is in principle inevitable
for a real comprehension of quantum theory. This attitude is mainly related to
epistemological arguments. However, the measurement problem often seems not to
be treated clearly enough within the interpretation. By referring to the
property of the necessity to use macroscopic measurement instruments obeying
classical concepts it is made the attempt to solve the measurement problem.
According to this consideration the indeterministic character of quantum theory
seems to have its origin in a lack of knowledge and thus it appears in a
similar but more principle way than in statistical mechanics. It is emphasized
the ontological character of the uncertainty relation and the related non
locality of quantum theory suggesting that the existence of a position space is
not as fundamental as the assumptions of general quantum theory.

predicted colors for galaxies with young ages (less than 8 Gyr) with the known

internal accuracies to the spectroscopic indices. In contrast, using only the
$<$Fe$>$ index to determine [Fe/H], and assuming a mean age of 12 Gyr for a
galaxy's stellar population, we derive colors that exactly match not only the
color zeropoint of the CMR but also its slope. We consider the source of young
age estimates, the H$\beta$ index, and examine the conflict between red
continuum colors and large H$\beta$ values in galaxy spectra. We conclude that
our current understanding of stellar populations is insufficient to correctly
interpret H$\beta$ values and that the sum of our galaxy observations supports
an old and monolithic scenario of galaxy formation. This result has a
devastating impact on every study that has used the H$\beta$ index to calculate
galaxy age, as the use of the H$\beta$ versus MgFe diagram will result in
incorrectly deduced young ages.
