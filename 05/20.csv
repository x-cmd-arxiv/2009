in string theory by taking non-supersymmetric orbifolds of supersymmetric
backgrounds. The scale of SUSY breaking is the AdS radius, and the dual field
theory has explicitly broken supersymmetry. The large hierarchy of energy
scales in these geometries is stable. We establish this by showing that the
dual gauge theories do not have any relevant operators which are singlets under
the global symmetries. When the geometries are embedded in a compact internal
space, a large enough discrete subgroup of the global symmetries can still
survive to prevent any singlet relevant operators from arising. We illustrate
this by embedding one case in a non-supersymmetric orbifold of a Calabi-Yau
manifold. These examples can serve as a starting point for obtaining
Randall-Sundrum models in string theory, and more generally for constructing
composite Higgs or technicolor-like models where strongly coupled dynamics
leads to the breaking of electro-weak symmetry. Towards the end of the paper,
we briefly discuss how bulk gauge fields can be incorporated by introducing
D7-branes in the bulk, and also show how the strongly coupled dynamics can lead
to an emergent weakly coupled gauge theory in the IR with matter fields
including scalars.

in the standard model? We examine the possibility that dark matter is hidden,
that is, neutral under all standard model gauge interactions, but charged under
an exact U(1) gauge symmetry of the hidden sector. Such candidates are
predicted in WIMPless models, supersymmetric models in which hidden dark matter
has the desired thermal relic density for a wide range of masses. Hidden
charged dark matter has many novel properties not shared by neutral dark
matter: (1) bound state formation and Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation after
chemical freeze out may reduce its relic density, (2) similar effects greatly
enhance dark matter annihilation in protohalos at redshifts of z ~ 30, (3)
Compton scattering off hidden photons delays kinetic decoupling, suppressing
small scale structure, and (4) Rutherford scattering makes such dark matter
self-interacting and collisional, potentially impacting properties of the
Bullet Cluster and the observed morphology of galactic halos. We analyze all of
these effects in a WIMPless model in which the hidden sector is a simplified
version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and the dark matter is a
hidden sector stau. We find that charged hidden dark matter is viable and
consistent with the correct relic density for reasonable model parameters and
dark matter masses in the range 1 GeV < m_X < 10 TeV. At the same time, in the
preferred range of parameters, this model predicts cores in the dark matter
halos of small galaxies and other halo properties that may be within the reach
of future observations. These models therefore provide a viable and
well-motivated framework for collisional dark matter with Sommerfeld
enhancement, with novel implications for astrophysics and dark matter searches.

was observed by VERITAS for 31 hours in 2006, 2008 and 2009. During these

with Swift XRT reveal a factor of 1.8+-0.4 higher flux in the 1-10 keV range

clearly resolve the transition from the tracer like behavior of small particles

decreases with diameter as d^{-2/3} in agreement with inertial range scaling
arguments. A model relating <a^2> to the pressure structure functions matches
the transition from small to large particle behavior if the particles respond
to pressure differences over (1.7 +- 0.3) d. A model relating <a^2> to the
fluid acceleration averaged over the particle diameter predicts the transition
with no free parameters, but does not show clean inertial range scaling in the

the solar-type star HD49933, which is a primary target for the CoRoT satellite.
We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra to carry out a
consistent parameter estimation and abundance analysis of HD49933. The LLmodels
code was employed for model atmosphere calculations, while Synth3 and Width9
codes were used for line profile calculation and LTE abundance analysis. In
this paper we provide a detailed description of the methodology adopted to
derive the fundamental parameters and the abundances. Although the obtained
parameters differ from the ones previously derived by other authors, we show
that only the set obtained in this work is able to fit the observed spectrum
accurately. In particular, the surface gravity was adjusted to fit
pressure-sensitive spectral features. We confirm the importance of a consistent
analysis of relevant spectroscopic features, application of advanced model
atmospheres, and the use of up-to-date atomic line data for the determination
of stellar parameters. These results are crucial for further studies, e.g.
detailed theoretical modelling of the observed pulsation frequencies.

$\GL$, in the squid giant axon appears to be optimal for the action potential
firing frequency. More precisely, the standard assumption that the leak current
is composed of chloride ions leads to the result that the experimental value
for $\GL$ is very close to the optimal value in the Hodgkin-Huxley model which
minimizes the absolute refractory period of the action potential, thereby
maximizing the maximum firing frequency under stimulation by sharp, brief input
current spikes to one end of the axon. The measured value of $\GL$ also appears
to be close to optimal for the frequency of repetitive firing caused by a
constant current input to one end of the axon, especially when temperature
variations are taken into account. If, by contrast, the leak current is assumed
to be composed of separate voltage-independent sodium and potassium currents,
then these optimizations are not observed.

astrometry and those seen in the Spitzer images cannot be readily established,
due either to strong non-gravitational terms, astrometric uncertainties, or
transience of the fragments outgassing. The Spitzer data resolve the structure
of the dust comae at a resolution of 1000 km, and they reveal the infrared

Couette linear shear flow is linearly stable for all values of the Reynolds
number, but experimentally transition from the linear shear to turbulence
occurs under perturbations of any size when the Reynolds number is large
enough. In [Li, Lin 2011], we offered a resolution of this paradox. The aim of
this paper is to provide a numerical implementation of the resolution. The main
idea of the resolution is that even though the linear shear is linearly stable,
slow orbits (also called quasi-steady states) in arbitrarily small
neighborhoods of the linear shear can be linearly unstable. The key is that in
infinite dimensions, smallness in one norm does not mean smallness in all
norms. Our study here focuses upon a sequence of 2D oscillatory shears which
are the Couette linear shear plus small amplitude and high frequency sinusoidal
shear perturbations. In the fluid velocity variable, the sequence approaches
the Couette linear shear (e.g. in $L^2$ norm of velocity), thus it can be
viewed as Couette linear shear plus small noises; while in the fluid vorticity
variable, the sequence does not approaches the Couette linear shear (e.g. in
$H^1$ norm of velocity). Unlike the Couette linear shear, the sequence of
oscillatory shears has inviscid linear instability; furthermore, with the
sequence of oscillatory shears as potentials, the Orr-Sommerfeld operator has
unstable eigenvalues when the Reynolds number is large enough, this should lead
to transient nonlinear growth which manifests as transient turbulence as
observed in experiments. The main result of this paper verifies this transient
growth.

this paper we focus on the identification and reduction of a source of excess
noise detected when measuring time-varying temperature signals. This is shown
to be due to non-idealities in the ADC transfer curve, and degrades the
measurement by about one order of magnitude in the measurement bandwidth when
the measured temperature exhibits drifts of uK/s. In a suitable measuring
system for the LISA mission, this noise needs to be reduced. Two different
methods based on the same technique have been implemented, both consisting in
the addition of dither signals out of band to mitigate the ADC non-ideality
errors. Excess noise of this nature has been satisfactorily reduced by using
these methods when measuring temperature ramps up to 10 uK/s .

different elements sampled over 243 sight lines in the local part of our Galaxy
reveals that the depletions into solid form (dust grains) are extremely well
characterized by trends that employ only three kinds of parameters. One is an
index that describes the overall level of depletion applicable to the gas in
any particular sight line, and the other two represent linear coefficients that
describe how to derive each element's depletion from this sight-line parameter.
The information from this study reveals the relative proportions of different
elements that are incorporated into dust at different stages of grain growth.
An extremely simple scheme is proposed for deriving the dust contents and
metallicities of absorption-line systems that are seen in the spectra of
distant quasars or the optical afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Contrary to
presently accepted thinking, the elements sulfur and krypton appear to show
measurable changes in their depletions as the general levels of depletions of
other elements increase, although more data are needed to ascertain whether or
not these findings truly compelling. Nitrogen appears to show no such increase.
The incorporation of oxygen into solid form in the densest gas regions far

to a constant additive phase) for a set of unknown angles
$\theta_1,...,\theta_n$ from $m$ noisy measurements of their offsets
$\theta_i-\theta_j \mod 2\pi$. Of particular interest is angle recovery in the
presence of many outlier measurements that are uniformly distributed in
$[0,2\pi)$ and carry no information on the true offsets. We introduce an
efficient recovery algorithm for the unknown angles from the top eigenvector of
a specially designed Hermitian matrix. The eigenvector method is extremely
stable and succeeds even when the number of outliers is exceedingly large. For
example, we successfully estimate $n=400$ angles from a full set of $m={400

on a commercial laptop. The performance of the method is analyzed using random
matrix theory and information theory. We discuss the relation of the
synchronization problem to the combinatorial optimization problem
\textsc{Max-2-Lin mod} $L$ and present a semidefinite relaxation for angle
recovery, drawing similarities with the Goemans-Williamson algorithm for
finding the maximum cut in a weighted graph. We present extensions of the

group structures and their applications, such as the time synchronization
problem in distributed networks and the surface reconstruction problems in

prediction of the electroweak theory is the existence of the Higgs boson, a
weakly interacting spin-zero particle that is the agent of electroweak symmetry
breaking, the giver of mass to the weak gauge bosons, the quarks, and the
leptons. General arguments imply that the Higgs boson or other new physics is
required on the TeV energy scale. Indirect constraints from global analyses of
electroweak measurements suggest that the mass of the standard-model Higgs
boson is less than 200 GeV. Once its mass is assumed, the properties of the
Higgs boson follow from the electroweak theory, and these inform the search for
the Higgs boson. Alternative mechanisms for electroweak symmetry breaking are
reviewed, and the importance of electroweak symmetry breaking is illuminated by
considering a world without a specific mechanism to hide the electroweak
symmetry.

emission-line and continuum spectra that are suitable for direct fitting to
X-ray data is challenging because the reprocessed emission depends on the
spectral shape of the incident continuum, which may not be directly observable.
We present new Monte-Carlo calculations of Green's functions for a toroidal
reprocessor that provide significant improvements over currently available
models. The Green's function approach enables the construction of X-ray
spectral fitting models that allow arbitrary incident spectra as part of the
fitting process. The calculations are fully relativistic and have been
performed for column densities that cover the Compton-thin to Compton-thick
regime, for incident photon energies up to 500 keV. The reprocessed continuum
and fluorescent line emission due to Fe Ka, Fe Kb, and Ni Ka are treated
self-consistently, eliminating the need for ad hoc modeling that is currently
common practice. We find that the spectral shape of the Compton-thick
reflection spectrum in both the soft and hard X-ray bands in our toroidal
geometry is different compared to that obtained from disk models. A key result
of our study is that a Compton-thick toroidal structure that subtends the same
solid angle at the X-ray source as a disk can produce a reflection spectrum
that is ~6 times weaker than that from a disk. This highlights the widespread
and erroneous interpretation of the so-called ""reflection-fraction"" as a solid
angle, obtained from fitting disk-reflection models to Compton-thick sources

extended emission associated with the CCO, nor statistically significant
pulsations (the 3-sigma upper limit on pulsed fraction is about 16%). The fits
of the CCO spectrum with the power-law model yield a large photon index,
Gamma\approx 5, and a hydrogen column density larger than that obtained from
the SNR spectra. The fits with the blackbody model are statistically
unacceptable. Better fits are provided by hydrogen or helium neutron star
atmosphere models, with the best-fit effective temperature kT_{eff}^\infty
\approx 0.2 keV, but they require a small star's radius, R = 4 - 5.5 km, and a
low mass, M < 0.8 M_sol. A neutron star cannot have so small radius and mass,
but the observed emission might emerge from an atmosphere of a strange quark
star. More likely, the CCO could be a neutron star with a nonuniform surface
temperature and a low surface magnetic field (the so-called anti-magnetar),
similar to three other CCOs for which upper limits on period derivative have

supply setting, where a single seller with $n$ items caters to $m$ buyers with
unknown subadditive valuation functions who arrive in a sequence. The seller
sets the prices on individual items. Each buyer buys a subset of yet unsold
items that maximizes her utility. Our goal is to design pricing strategies that
guarantee an expected revenue that is within a small factor $\alpha$ of the
maximum possible social welfare -- an upper bound on the maximum revenue that
can be generated. Most earlier work has focused on the unlimited supply
setting, where selling items to some buyer does not affect their availability
to the future buyers. Balcan et. al. (EC 2008) studied the limited supply
setting, giving a randomized strategy that assigns a single price to all items
(uniform strategy), and never changes it (static strategy), that gives an
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log n \log \log n})}$-approximation, and moreover, no static
uniform pricing strategy can give better than $2^{\Omega(\log^{1/4} n)}$-
approximation. We improve this lower bound to $2^{\Omega(sqrt{\log n})}$.
  We consider dynamic uniform strategies, which can change the price upon the
arrival of each buyer but the price on all unsold items is the same at all
times, and static non-uniform strategies, which can assign different prices to
different items but can never change it after setting it initially. We design
such pricing strategies that give a poly-logarithmic approximation to maximum
revenue. Thus in the limited supply setting, our results highlight a strong
separation between the power of dynamic and non-uniform pricing versus static
uniform pricing. To our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial analysis of
dynamic and non-uniform pricing schemes for revenue maximization.

the central zone of the starburst galaxy M82, all surrounded by compact and
dense HII regions. We claim that the only way that such HII regions can survive
around the selected clusters, is if they are embedded into a high pressure ISM
and if the majority of their mechanical energy is lost within the star cluster
volume via strong radiative cooling. The latter implies that these clusters
have a low heating efficiency, $\eta$, and evolve in the bimodal hydrodynamic
regime. In this regime the shock-heated plasma in the central zones of a
cluster becomes thermally unstable, loses its pressure and is accumulated
there, whereas the matter injected by supernovae and stellar winds outside of
this volume forms a high velocity outflow - the star cluster wind. We
calculated the heating efficiency for each of the selected clusters and found
that in all cases it does not exceed 10% . Such low heating efficiency values
imply a low mechanical energy output and the impact that the selected clusters
provide to the ISM of M82 is thus much smaller than what one would expect using
stellar cluster synthetic models.

in specular reflectivity geometry, switching the left/right elliptical

magnetization profiles, minimizing the number of free parameters as much as
possible. Optical constants of the samples (real and imaginary part of the
refractive index) in the interested frequency range are obtained through
absorption measurements in two magnetization states and subsequent
Kramers-Kronig transformation, allowing quantitative fits of the magnetization
profile at different temperatures. We apply this method to the study of

accelerating the overall search process. This acceleration mechanism is most

2.2 as the field changes from 200G to 1000G. Due to the surprisingly strong
field dependence of the power and the superfluid density we proceeded to fit
the temperature dependence to a two gap model, where the size of the two gaps
is field independent. From this model, we obtained gaps of
$2\Delta_1=3.7k_BT_c$ and $2\Delta_2=1.6k_BT_c$, corresponding to roughly 6 meV
and 3 meV respectively.

that for all realistic impurity strengths the Zeeman bound state survives the

These results serve to yield new estimators in the Haar transform domain,
including an unbiased risk estimate for shrinkage of Haar-Fisz
variance-stabilized data, along with accompanying low-complexity algorithms for

our Skellam shrinkage estimators both for the standard univariate wavelet test

supergiant stars that are increasingly thought to result from the merger of two
white dwarfs, called the Double degenerate scenario. This scenario is also
studied as a source, at higher mass, of type Ia Supernovae (SnIa) explosions.
Therefore a better understanding of RCBs composition would help to constrain
simulations of such events. We searched for and studied RCB stars in the EROS
Magellanic Clouds database. We also extended our research to DY Per type stars
(DYPers) that are expected to be cooler RCBs (T~3500 K) and much more numerous
than their hotter counterparts. The light curves of ~70 millions stars have
been analysed to search for the main signature of RCBs and DYPers: a large drop
in luminosity. Follow-up optical spectroscopy was used to confirm each
photometric candidate found. We have discovered and confirmed 6 new Magellanic
Cloud RCB stars and 7 new DYPers, but also listed new candidates: 3 RCBs and 14
DYPers. We estimated a range of Magellanic RCB shell temperatures between 360
and 600 K. We confirm the wide range of absolute luminosity known for RCB
stars, M_V~-5.2 to -2.6. Our study further shows that mid-infrared surveys are
ideal to search for RCB stars, since they have thinner and cooler circumstellar
shells than classical post-AGB stars. In addition, by increasing the number of
known DYPers by ~400%, we have been able to shed light on the similarities in
the spectral energy distribution between DYPers and ordinary carbon stars. We
also observed that DYPer circumstellar shells are fainter and hotter than those
of RCBs. This suggests that DYPers may simply be ordinary carbon stars with
ejection events, but more abundance analysis is necessary to give a status on a
possible evolutionnary connexion between RCBs and DYPers.

complex manifolds with trivial canonical bundle and with no compatible Kahler

smoothing is a natural S^3-bundle over H^3, its holomorphic geometry is
determined by the hyperbolic metric; the small-resolution is a natural
S^2-bundle over H^4 with symplectic geometry determined by the metric. Using
hyperbolic geometry, we find orbifold quotients with trivial canonical bundle;
smooth examples are produced via crepant resolutions. In particular, we find
the first example of a simply-connected symplectic 6-manifold with c_1=0 that
does not admit a compatible Kahler structure. We also find infinitely many
distinct complex structures on 2(S^3xS^3)#(S^2xS^4) with trivial canonical

assume that the rapid rotation of the core of a collapsing star can be

of formation of rapidly rotating neutron stars is qualitatively consistent with
estimates of the formation rate of magnetars. However, our analysis of the
binarity of newly-born compact objects with short rotational periods indicates
that the fraction of binaries among them substantially exceeds the

statistics for magnetars, the additional velocity acquired by a magnetar during
its formation must be primarily perpendicular to the orbital plane before the
supernova explosion, and be large.

aM, and cosmological constant \Lambda > - 3/(a^2). To describe fermions in

greatly improve the convergence rate, (2) the detection of partial (or all)
locations of unknown jointly sparse signals by using so-called MUSIC algorithm;
(3) the iterative NESTA-based algorithm by combing hard thresholding technique
to decrease the numbers of measurements. It has been shown that by using
proposed approach one can recover the unknown sparse matrix X with () Spark A
-sparsity from () Spark A measurements, predicted in Ref. [1], where the
measurement matrix denoted by A satisfies the so-called restricted isometry

coexistence of short-range interaction and diagonal disorder, we obtain the
ground-state phase diagram in three dimensions, which includes an
antiferromagnetic insulator, an antiferromagnetic metal, a paramagnetic
insulator (Anderson-localized insulator) and a paramagnetic metal. Although
only the short-range interaction is present in this model, we find
unconventional soft gaps in the insulating phases irrespective of electron
filling, spatial dimensions and long-range order, where the single-particle
density of states (DOS) vanishes with a power-law scaling in one dimension (1D)
or even faster in two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D) toward the
Fermi energy. We call it soft Hubbard gap. Moreover, exact-diagonalization
results in 1D support the formation of the soft Hubbard gap beyond the
mean-field level. The formation of the soft Hubbard gap cannot be attributed to
a conventional theory by Efros and Shklovskii (ES) owing the emergence of soft
gaps to the long-range Coulomb interaction. Indeed, based on a picture of
multivalley energy landscape, we propose a phenomenological scaling theory,
which predicts a scaling of the DOS in perfect agreement with the numerical
results. We further discuss a correction of the scaling of the DOS by the
long-range part of the Coulomb interaction, which modifies the scaling of Efros
and Shklovskii. Furthermore, explicit formulae for the temperature dependence
of the DC resistivity via variable-range hopping under the influence of the
soft gaps are derived. Finally, we compare the present theory with experimental
results of SrRu_{1-x}Ti_xO_3.

presence of magnetic fields. This effect may lead to a significant change in
the observed spectra of gamma-ray sources such as AGNs. Here we carry out a
detailed study that for the first time simultaneously considers in the same
framework both the photon/axion mixing that takes place in the gamma-ray source
and that one expected to occur in the intergalactic magnetic fields. An
efficient photon/axion mixing in the source always means an attenuation in the
photon flux, whereas the mixing in the intergalactic medium may result in a
decrement and/or enhancement of the photon flux, depending on the distance of
the source and the energy considered. Interestingly, we find that decreasing
the value of the intergalactic magnetic field strength, which decreases the
probability for photon/axion mixing, could result in an increase of the
expected photon flux at Earth if the source is far enough. We also find a 30%
attenuation in the intensity spectrum of distant sources, which occurs at an
energy that only depends on the properties of the ALPs and the intensity of the
intergalactic magnetic field, and thus independent of the AGN source being
observed. Moreover, we show that this mechanism can easily explain recent
puzzles in the spectra of distant gamma-ray sources... [ABRIDGED] The
consequences that come from this work are testable with the current generation

candidate associated with a M31 globular cluster, Bo 144, on the basis of X-ray
spectral and timing properties. The 2002 XMM-Newton observation of the
associated X-ray source (hereafter XBo 144) revealed behaviour that is common
to all low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the low-hard state. Studies have
shown that neutron star LMXBs exhibit this behaviour at 0.01-1000 keV
luminosities <=10% of the Eddington limit (L_Edd). However, the unabsorbed
0.3-10 keV XBo 144 luminosity was ~0.30 L_Edd for a 1.4 M_sun neutron star, and

generation in helium atoms using intense visible light (\lambda=390nm). Two
complementary approaches are used which account for correlation in an
approximate manner: time-dependent density-functional theory and a
single-active-electron model. For intensities I~10^{14} W/cm^2, the theories
are in remarkably good agreement for the dynamic polarization and harmonic
spectrum. This is attributed to a low-frequency collective mode together with a
high-frequency single-electron response due to the nuclear singularity, both of
which dominate electron correlation effects. A time-frequency analysis is used
to study the timing and emission spectrum of attosecond bursts of light. For
short pulses, we find a secondary maximum below the classical cut-off. The
imprint of the carrier-envelope-phase, for the time-integrated spectral density
appears at frequencies above the high-frequency drop-off, consistent with
previous studies in the infrared \lambda~800nm.

continuum model to describe the origin of orientational order in such confined

angle dependent collisions with pre-existing microtubules that can lead either
to co-alignment of the growth, retraction through catastrophe induction or
crossing over the encountered microtubule. We identify a single control
parameter, which is fully determined by the nucleation rate and intrinsic
dynamics of individual microtubules. We solve the model analytically in the

phase, and explicitly solve for the ordered stationary states in a simplified

the striped antiferromagnetic orders with distortion are more favorable in
total energy than the checkerboard antiferromagnetic orders with tetragonal
symmetry, which is consistent with known experimental data, and the inter-layer
magnetic interaction is very weak. We investigate the electronic structures and
magnetic property of the distorted phases. We also present our calculated spin

source within the ISGRI error circle, showing a hard spectrum, and improving
its high-energy localisation to a subarcsecond accuracy. Thus, the X-ray source
was associated to the infrared counterpart 2MASS J09023731-4813339 whose JHKs
photometry indicated a highly reddened source. The high-energy properties and
the counterpart photometry suggested a high-mass X-ray binary with a main

performed optical and near infrared observations on the counterpart 2MASS

extended, thus excluding any Galactic compact source possibility. The source
spectrum shows three main emission lines identified as the HeI lambda 1.0830
micron line, and the HI Pa_beta and Pa_alpha lines, typical in galaxies with an
active galactic nucleus. The broadness of these lines reached values as large
as 4000 km/s pointing towards a type 1 Seyfert galaxy. The redshift of the

crystalline structure fused epitaxially to the beta-Mn domain surfaces, whose
primitive cell has lattice parameters a = b = c = a_{beta-Mn}, alpha = beta =
90 degrees, and gamma = 45 degrees. This secondary phase adopts a structure
which appears to have no known counterpart in the experimental literature, but
can be simply derived from the Cr_3Si and Al_3Zr_4 structure types. We used
these observations as the basis for an atomistic structural model for octagonal
quasicrystals, in which the beta-Mn and the secondary phase structure unit
cells serve as square and rhombic tiles (in projection), respectively. Its
diffraction pattern down the octagonal axis resembles those experimentally
measured. The model is unique in being consistent with high-resolution electron
microscopy images showing square and rhombic units with edge-lengths equal to
that of the beta-Mn unit cell. Energy minimization of this configuration, using
the same pair potential as above, results in an alternative octagonal

there are effects related with the modification of the equatorial F2-region

of the charge susceptibility is quite accurate in situations where the singly

to overestimate charge fluctuations in the asymmetric model at too low

Kondo-screening of the impurity spin through the conduction band, i.e. the
formation of the local Kondo-singlet. A finite local Coulomb interaction U
leads to a drastic reduction of the charge response via processes involving the

parameters are obtained in a single step by solving a linear system. Simulation

the mean field or weak coupling level, the charge quadrupole contributes the
lowest order modification to the contact value theorem and thus to the
intersurface electrostatic interactions. The image effects are non-existent on
the mean-field level even with multipoles. On the strong coupling level the
quadrupoles and higher order multipoles contribute additional terms to the
interaction free energy only in the presence of dielectric inhomogeneities.
Without them, the monopole is the only multipole that contributes to the strong
coupling electrostatics. We explore the consequences of these statements in all

small ratio of Higgs expectation values tan beta. We find that, in the presence
of localized Fayet-Iliopoulos terms, y_t is suppressed against g because the
bulk fields acquire non-trivial profiles whose overlap is smaller than in the
case of flat profiles. This increases the prediction for tan beta to moderately
large values. Thus tan beta is related to the geometry of compact space. We
also discuss explicit realizations of such settings in orbifold

are given and convergence is proved. Numerical tests are given.
  This is done by building tools enabling geometric interpretations of the

expressing conservation of energy for Helmholtz equation, are defined on the

for proving convergence of the given algorithm for Helmholtz equation in a

  Using these tools, one can prove that the Domain Decomposition setting for

prove that if a solution exists, it is unique. And that the algorithm do

of the chromo-magnetic vacuum, falls off with the increase of temperature. At
temperatures larger than the deconfinement critical temperature by a factor of

verified while others seem clearly violated, with inconsistent values of some
MCT exponents. We show that this is due to strong pre-asymptotic effects that
disappear only in a surprisingly narrow region around the critical point. Our
study of Finite Size Scaling (FSS) show that standard theory valid for pure
systems fails because of strong sample to sample fluctuations. We propose a
modified form of FSS that accounts well for our results. {\it En passant,} we
also give new theoretical insights about FSS in disordered systems above their
upper critical dimension. Our conclusion is that the quantitative predictions
of MCT are exceedingly difficult to test even for models for which MCT is
exact. Our results highlight that some predictions are more robust than others.
