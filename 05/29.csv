timing program using the RISE instrument on the Liverpool Telescope. A
Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo analysis was used to determine the planet-star radius
ratio and inclination of the system, which were found to be
Rp/Rstar=0.1664^{+0.0011}_{-0.0018} and i = 81.73^{+0.13}_{-0.04} respectively,
consistent with previous results. The central transit times and uncertainties
were also calculated, using a residual-permutation algorithm as an independent
check on the errors. A re-analysis of eight previously published TrES-3 light
curves was conducted to determine the transit times and uncertainties using
consistent techniques. Whilst the transit times were not found to be in
agreement with a linear ephemeris, giving chi^2 = 35.07 for 15 degrees of
freedom, we interpret this to be the result of systematics in the light curves
rather than a real transit timing variation. This is because the light curves
that show the largest deviation from a constant period either have relatively
little out-of-transit coverage, or have clear systematics. A new ephemeris was
calculated using the transit times, and was found to be T_c(0) = 2454632.62610
+- 0.00006 HJD and P = 1.3061864 +- 0.0000005 days. The transit times were then
used to place upper mass limits as a function of the period ratio of a
potential perturbing planet, showing that our data are sufficiently sensitive
to have probed for sub-Earth mass planets in both interior and exterior 2:1
resonances, assuming the additional planet is in an initially circular orbit.

candidates recently imaged directly. We undertake a coherent analysis of
various portions of observational data on all known components of the system.
The goal is to elucidate the architecture and evolutionary status of the
system. We try to further constrain the age and orientation of the system,
orbits and masses of the companions, as well as the location of dust. From the
high luminosity of debris dust and dynamical constraints, we argue for a rather
young system's age of <50Myr. The system must be seen nearly, but not exactly,
pole-on. Our analysis of the stellar rotational velocity yields an inclination
of 13-30deg, whereas i>20deg is needed for the system to be dynamically stable,
which suggests a probable inclination range of 20-30deg. The spectral energy
distribution is naturally reproduced with two dust rings associated with two
planetesimal belts. The inner ""asteroid belt"" is located at ~10AU inside the
orbit of the innermost companion and a ""Kuiper belt"" at >100AU is just exterior
to the orbit of the outermost companion. The dust masses in the inner and outer
ring are estimated to be ~1E-05 and 4E-02 M_earth, respectively. We show that
all three planetary candidates may be stable in the mass range suggested in the
discovery paper by Marois et al. 2008 (between 5 and 13 Jupiter masses), but
only for some of all possible orientations. Stable orbits imply a double
(4:2:1) mean-motion resonance between all three companions. We finally show
that in the cases where the companions themselves are orbitally stable, the
dust-producing planetesimal belts are also stable against planetary
perturbations.

conventional cross-layer designs all require channel state information at the

focus on cross-layer resource optimization based on ACK/NAK feedback flows in
OFDM systems without explicit CSIT. While the problem can be modeled as Markov
Decision Process (MDP), brute force approach by policy iteration or value
iteration cannot lead to any viable solution. Thus, we derive a simple
closed-form solution for the MDP cross-layer problem, which is asymptotically
optimal for sufficiently small target packet error rate (PER). The proposed
solution also has low complexity and is suitable for realtime implementation.
It is also shown to achieve significant performance gain compared with systems
that do not utilize the ACK/NAK feedbacks for cross-layer designs or
cross-layer systems that utilize very unreliable CSIT for adaptation with
mismatch in CSIT error statistics. Asymptotic analysis is also provided to
obtain useful design insights.

non-equilibrium bound state (NEBS), which is an emergent property of the
coupled local plus itinerant spin system. For certain definite parameter values
the itinerant spin lingers near the local spins for some time, before
eventually leaking out as an outwardly diffusing state. This phenomenon results
in novel spin-flip dynamics and filtering properties for this type of system.

generalization of the Marolf-Mann quasilocal formalism to the Kaluza-Klein

Conversely the presence of such a plenitude of axions (an ""axiverse"") would be
evidence for string theory, since it arises due to the topological complexity
of the extra-dimensional manifold and is ad hoc in a theory with just the four
familiar dimensions. We investigate how upcoming astrophysical experiments will
explore the existence of such axions over a vast mass range from 10^-33eV to
10^-10eV. Axions with masses between 10^-33eV to 10^-28eV cause a rotation of
the CMB polarization that is constant throughout the sky. The predicted
rotation angle is of order \alpha~1/137. Axions in the mass range 10^-28eV to
10^-18eV give rise to multiple steps in the matter power spectrum, that will be
probed by upcoming galaxy surveys. Axions in the mass range 10^-22eV to
10^-10eV affect the dynamics and gravitational wave emission of rapidly
rotating astrophysical black holes through the Penrose superradiance process.
When the axion Compton wavelength is of order of the black hole size, the
axions develop ""superradiant"" atomic bound states around the black hole
""nucleus"". Their occupation number grows exponentially by extracting rotational
energy from the ergosphere, culminating in a rotating Bose-Einstein axion
condensate emitting gravitational waves. This mechanism creates mass gaps in
the spectrum of rapidly rotating black holes that diagnose the presence of
axions. The rapidly rotating black hole in the X-ray binary LMC X-1 implies an
upper limit on the decay constant of the QCD axion f_a<2*10^17GeV, much below

galactic nuclei (AGN), whose accretion is regulated by feedback. However, the
interaction between the hot gas ejected by the AGN and the ambient intracluster
medium is extremely difficult to simulate as it involves a wide range of
spatial scales and gas that is Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) unstable. Here we present a
series of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a self-regulating AGN
in a galaxy cluster. Our adaptive-mesh simulations include prescriptions for
radiative cooling, AGN heating and a subgrid model for RT-driven turbulence,
which is crucial to simulate this evolution. AGN heating is taken to be
proportional to the rest-mass energy that is accreted onto the central region
of the cluster. For a wide range of feedback efficiencies, the cluster
regulates itself for at least several $10^9$ years. Heating balances cooling
through a string of outbursts with typical recurrence times of around 80 Myrs,
a timescale that depends only on global cluster properties. Under certain
conditions we find central dips in the metallicity of the intracluster medium.
Provided the sub-grid model used here captures all its key properties,
turbulence plays an essential role in the AGN self-regulation in cluster cores.

canonical active neutrino via a see-saw mass matrix. We show that there is
\emph{no unitary} transformation that diagonalizes the mixed propagator and a
field redefinition is required. The propagating or ``mass'' states correspond
to an unsterile-like and active-like mode. The unsterile mode features a
complex pole or resonance for $0 \leq \eta < 1/3$ with an ``invisible width''
which is the result of the decay of the unsterile mode into the active mode and
the massless particles of the hidden conformal sector. For $\eta \geq 1/3$, the
complex pole disappears, merging with the unparticle threshold. The active mode
is described by a stable pole, but ``inherits'' a non-vanishing spectral
density above the unparticle threshold as a consequence of the mixing. We find
that the \emph{radiative} decay width of the unsterile neutrino into the active
neutrino (and a photon) via charged current loops, is \emph{suppressed} by a
factor $\sim \Big[2 \sin^2(\theta_0)

the high strength of inter-atomic interactions in the ordered three-dimensional

proposed, and associated dynamical integrators, as well as sampling Monte-Carlo
schemes, are analyzed for systems with multiple time scales. The penalization
is based on an extended Hamiltonian with artificial constraints associated with
some selected DOFs. The penalty parameters enable arbitrary tuning of
timescales for the selected DOFs. The IMMP dynamics is shown to be an
interpolation between the exact Hamiltonian dynamics and the dynamics with
rigid constraints. This property translates in the associated numerical
integrator into a tunable trade-off between stability and dynamical
modification. Moreover, a penalty that vanishes with the time-step yields order
two convergent schemes for the exact dynamics. Moreover, by construction, the
resulting dynamics preserves the canonical equilibrium distribution in position
variables, up to a computable geometric correcting potential, leading to
Metropolis-like unbiased sampling algorithms. The algorithms can be implemented
with a simple modification of standard geometric integrators with algebraic
constraints imposed on the selected DOFs, and has no additional complexity in
terms of enforcing the constraints and force evaluations. The properties of the
IMMP method are demonstrated numerically on the $N$-alkane model, showing that
the time-step stability region of integrators and the sampling efficiency can
be increased with a gain that grows with the size of the system. This feature
is mathematically analyzed for a harmonic atomic chain model. When a large
stiffness parameter is introduced, the IMMP method is shown to be
asymptotically stable and to converge towards the heuristically expected
Markovian effective dynamics on the slow manifold.

may in principle be detectable through strong-lensing image splitting of
quasars on small angular scales (0.01 arcseconds or below). Here, we estimate
the overall probabilities for lensing by substructures in a host halo closely
aligned to the line of sight to a background quasar. Under the assumption that
the quasar can be approximated as a point source, the optical depth for strong
gravitational lensing by subhalos typically turns out to be very small (tau <
0.01), contrary to previous claims. We therefore conclude that it is currently
not feasible to use this strategy to put the simulation predictions for the
dark matter subhalo population to the test. However, if one assumes the source
to be spatially extended, as is the case for a quasar observed at radio
wavelengths, there is a reasonable probability for witnessing substructure
lensing effects even at rather large projected distances from the host galaxy,
provided that the angular resolution is sufficient. While multiply-imaged,
radio-loud quasars would be the best targets for unambiguously detecting dark
matter subhalos, even singly-imaged radio quasars might be useful for setting
upper limits on the abundance and central surface mass density of subhalos.

of encoding and exchanging data. As it turns out, its main advantage as an
encoding format (namely, its requirement that all open and close markup tags
are present and properly balanced) yield also one of its main disadvantages:
verbosity. XML-conscious compression techniques seek to overcome this drawback.
Many of these techniques first separate XML structure from the document
content, and then compress each independently. Further compression gains can be
realized by identifying and compressing together document content that is
highly similar, thereby amortizing the storage costs of auxiliary information
required by the chosen compression algorithm. Additionally, the proper choice
of compression algorithm is an important factor not only for the achievable
compression gain, but also for access performance. Hence, choosing a
compression configuration that optimizes compression gain requires one to
determine (1) a partitioning strategy for document content, and (2) the best
available compression algorithm to apply to each set within this partition. In
this paper, we show that finding an optimal compression configuration with
respect to compression gain is an NP-hard optimization problem. This problem
remains intractable even if one considers a single compression algorithm for
all content. We also describe an approximation algorithm for selecting a
partitioning strategy for document content based on the branch-and-bound
paradigm.

inside-out from material accumulated via accretion events. The Sagittarius
dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr dSph) is the best example of a such accretion, and
its ongoing disruption has resulted in that its stars are being deposited in
the Milky Way halo and outer disc. It is therefore appealing to search for
possible signatures of the Sgr dSph contribution to the build-up of the
Galactic disc. Interestingly, models of the Sgr dSph stream indicate clearly
that the trailing tail passes through the outer Galactic disc, at the same
galactocentric distance as some anti-centre old open star clusters. We
investigate in this Letter the possibility that the two outermost old open
clusters, Berkeley~29 and Saurer~1, could have formed inside the Sgr dSph and
then left behind in the outer Galactic disc as a result of tidal interaction
with the Milky Way. The actual location of these two star clusters, inside the
Sgr dSph trailing tail, is compatible with this scenario, and their chemical
and kinematical properties, together with our present understanding of the
age-metallicity relationship in the Sgr dSph, lends further support to this
possible association. Hence, we find it likely that the old open star clusters
Berkeley~29 and Saurer~1 have extra-galactic origins.

region \emph{length} is made. Numerical experiments confirm that both cusp-like
and modestly more extended geometries are realizable. However, importantly, the
length of the electron dissipation region, which is taken as a parameter by
several recent studies, is found to depend explicitly on the level of
hyper-resistivity. Furthermore, although hyper-resistivity can produce more
extended electron dissipation regions, the length of the region remains smaller
than one ion skin depth for the largest values of hyper-resistivity considered
here. These electron dissipation regions are significantly shorter than those
seen in many recent kinetic studies. The length of the electron dissipation
region is found to depend on electron inertia as well, scaling like
$(m_e/m_i)^{3/8}$. However, the thickness of the region appears to scale
similarly, so that the aspect ratio is at most very weakly dependent on
$(m_e/m_i)$. The limitations of scaling theories which do not predict the

small separation. On the other hand, a string extending through the wormhole
describes two charges which live in different field theories, and they exhibit
a spring-like confining potential. A transition occurs when there is a pair of
charges present within each field theory: for small separation each pair of
charges exhibits Coulomb interaction, while for large separation the charges in
the different field theories pair up and exhibit confinement. Two
steadily-moving charges in different field theories can occupy the same
location provided that their speed is less than a critical speed, which also
plays the role of a subluminal speed limit. However, for some wormhole
backgrounds, charges moving at the critical speed cannot occupy the same

general masses, having as its origin of coordinates the center of mass. The
transformation from the inertial coordinate system involves a combination of a
rotation to the principal axis of inertia, followed by three changes of scale
leading the principal moments of inertia to yield a body with three equal
moments of inertia, and finally a second rotation that leaves unaltered the
equal moments of inertia. These three transformations yield a mass-dependent
rigid orthogonal tetrahedron of constant volume in the inertial coordinates.
Each of those three linear transformations is a function of three coordinates
that produce the nine degrees of freedom of the Four-Body problem, in a
coordinate system with the center of mass as origin. The relation between the
well known equilateral tetrahedron solution of the gravitational Four-Body
problem and the new coordinates is exhibited, and the plane case of central

followed by a sharp decrease of <A(\epsilon)> within the energy interval from

projectively equivalent groups have the same spaces of cusp forms for all even

X-ray spectrum. To study the role of these electrons in clusters and other

We approximate an arbitrary electron distribution by the sum of Maxwellian
components. The decomposition is done using either a genetic algorithm or an
analytical approximation. The X-ray spectrum is then evaluated using a linear
combination of those Maxwellian components. Our method is fast and leads to an
accurate evaluation of the spectrum. The use of Maxwellian components allows to
use the standard collisional rates that are available in plasma codes such as
SPEX. We give an example of a spectrum for the supra-thermal electron
distribution behind a shock in a cluster of galaxies. The relative intensities
of the satellite lines in such a spectrum are sensitive to the presence of the
supra-thermal electrons. These lines can only be investigated with high
spectral resolution. We show that the instruments on future missions like

effective theory based on a Planck information flux limit, and normalized by
the black hole entropy formula, is developed to predict measurable

representing Matrix theory position operators with a Schr\""odinger wave

to study a class of algorithmic methods allowing to calculate the proper

out, given a set of initial conditions, which parameters (i.e., connection
weights in this case), allow to simulate the network spike dynamics. More
precisely we make explicit the fact that the back-engineering of a spike train,
is a Linear (L) problem if the membrane potentials are observed and a LP
problem if only spike times are observed, with a gIF model. Numerical
robustness is discussed. We also explain how it is the use of a generalized IF
neuron model instead of a leaky IF model that allows us to derive this
algorithm. Furthermore, we point out how the L or LP adjustment mechanism is
local to each unit and has the same structure as an ""Hebbian"" rule. A step
further, this paradigm is easily generalizable to the design of input-output
spike train transformations. This means that we have a practical method to

of their scientific data jointly. Concerning the search for bursting sources,
coherent data analysis methods have been shown to be more efficient. In the
coherent approach, the data collected by the detectors are time-shifted and
linearly combined so that the signatures received by each detector add up
constructively (thus improving the resulting signal-to-noise ratio). This
operation has to be performed over a sky grid (which determines the sky
locations to be searched). A limitation of those pipelines is their large
computing cost. One of the available degrees of freedom to reduce the cost is
the choice of the sky grid. Ideally, the sky sampling scheme should adapt the
angular resolution associated with the considered gravitational wave detector
network. As the geometry of detector network is not regular (the detectors are
not equally spaced and oriented), the angular resolution varies largely
depending on the sky location. We propose here a procedure which designs sky
grids that permit a complete sky coverage with a minimum number of vertices and

average work tends to diverge as the initial coupling parameter is brought

flows that are common in engineering applications is increasing and has yielded
new physical insights. However, for most engineering systems the dimension of
the dynamics is expected to be very large yet the flow field data is available
only for a finite time. In this context, it is important to establish the
convergence of the POD in order to accurately estimate such quantities as the
Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve dimension. Using direct numerical simulations of
Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in a finite cylindrical geometry we explore a
regime exhibiting extensive chaos and demonstrate the consequences of
performing a POD with a finite amount of data. In particular, we show that the
convergence in time of the eigenvalue spectrum, the eigenfunctions, and the
dimension are very slow in comparison with the time scale of the convection
rolls and that the errors incurred by not using the asymptotic values can be
significant. We compute the dimension using two approaches, the method of
snapshots and a Fourier method that exploits the azimuthal symmetry. We find
that the convergence rate of the Fourier method is vastly improved over the
method of snapshots. The dimension is found to be extensive as the system size
is increased and for a dimension measurement that captures 90% of the variance
in the data the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve dimension is about 20 times larger than the
Lyapunov dimension.

The more pronounced pygmy structure at lower energy is composed of
predominantly isoscalar states with surface-peaked transition densities. At
somewhat higher energy the calculated E1 strength is primarily of isovector

We pay a special attention to the renormalization of the intermediate

behavior in the nuclear medium of the rich spectrum of dynamically-generated
baryonic resonances in the C=1 and S=0 sector, and their influence in the
self-energy and, hence, the spectral function of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The
$D$ meson quasiparticle peak mixes with $\Sigma_c(2823)N^{-1}$ and
$\Sigma_c(2868)N^{-1}$ states while the $\Lambda_c(2595)N^{-1}$ mode is present

incorporates $J=3/2$ resonances, and $\Sigma_c(2902)N^{-1}$ and
$\Lambda_c(2941)N^{-1}$ fully determine the behavior of $D^*$ meson spectral
function at the quasiparticle peak. As density increases, these resonant-hole
modes tend to smear out and the spectral functions get broad. We also obtain
the $D$ and $D^*$ scattering lengths, and optical potentials for different
density regimes. The $D$ meson potential stays attractive while the $D^*$ meson
one is repulsive with increasing densities up to twice that of the normal

LHCb will exploit the large variety of B hadrons produced by the 14 TeV pp

asymptotic formula (Tassoul 1980), provided that the underlying rotation
profile is not too differential (Lignieres & Georgeot 2008, Reese et al. 2009).
  Aims: Given the simplicity of this asymptotic formula, we investigate whether
it can provide a means by which to identify pulsation modes in rapidly rotating
stars.
  Methods: We develop a new mode identification scheme which consists in
scanning a multidimensional parameter space for the formula coefficients which
yield the best-fitting asymptotic spectra. This mode identification scheme is
then tested on artificial spectra based on the asymptotic formula, on random
frequencies and on spectra based on full numerical eigenmode calculations for
which the mode identification is known beforehand. We also investigate the
effects of adding random frequencies to mimic the effects of chaotic modes
which are also expected to show up in such stars (Lignieres & Georgeot 2008).

proteins, using lysozyme and myoglobin as examples. Extensive molecular
dynamics simulations are performed to identify underlying mechanisms of the
dynamical transition that corresponds to the onset of amplified atomic
fluctuations in proteins. The number of water molecules within a cutoff
distance of each residue scales linearly with protein depth index and is not
affected by the local dynamics of the backbone. Keeping track of the water
molecules within the cutoff sphere, we observe an effective residence time,
scaling inversely with depth index at physiological temperatures while the
diffusive escape is highly reduced below the transition. A depth independent
orientational memory loss is obtained for the average dipole vector of the
water molecules within the sphere when the protein is functional. While below
the transition temperature, the solvent is in a glassy state, acting as a solid
crust around the protein, inhibiting any large scale conformational
fluctuations. At the transition, most of the hydration shell unfreezes and
water molecules collectively make the protein more flexible.

obtained via dimensional reduction over homogeneous spaces, in the explicit
example of SU(3)-equivariant dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills-Dirac theory
on manifolds of the form M x CP(2). We pay particular attention to the role of
topology of background gauge fields on the internal coset spaces, in this case
U(1) magnetic monopoles and SU(2) instantons on CP(2). The reduction of
Yang-Mills theory induces a quiver gauge theory involving coupled
Yang-Mills-Higgs systems on M with a Higgs potential leading to dynamical
symmetry breaking. The criterion for a ground state of the Higgs potential can
be written as the vanishing of a non-abelian Yang-Mills flux on the quiver
diagram, regarded as a lattice with group elements attached to the links. The
reduction of SU(3)-symmetric fermions yields Dirac fermions on M transforming
under the low-energy gauge group with Yukawa couplings. The fermionic zero
modes on CP(2) yield exactly massless chiral fermions on M, though there is a
unique choice of spin(c) structure on CP(2) for which some of the zero modes
can acquire masses through Yukawa interactions. We work out the spontaneous
symmetry breaking patterns and determine the complete physical particle
spectrum in a number of explicit examples, some of which possess quantum number
assignments qualitatively analogous to the manner in which vector bosons,
quarks and leptons acquire masses in the standard model.

constructing a finite complex which is acyclic under some sliding depth
conditions on the cycles of the Koszul complex. This complex provides
information on an ideal which coincides with the residual intersection in the
case of geometric residual intersection; and is closely related to it in
general. A new success obtained through studying such a complex is to prove the
Cohen-Macaulayness of residual intersections of a wide class of ideals. For
example we show that, in a Cohen-Macaulay local ring, any geometric residual
intersection of an ideal that satisfies the sliding depth condition is
Cohen-Macaulay; this is an affirmative answer to one of the main open questions
in the theory of residual intersection. The complex we construct also provides
a bound for the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a residual intersection in
term of the degrees of the minimal generators.

designed to solve the long-standing ``solar neutrino problem''; a discrepancy
between the measured and predicted flux of electron-flavour solar neutrinos.
SNO measured the rate of charged-current and neutral-current reactions of
neutrinos in heavy water and was able to demonstrate that neutrinos from the
Sun, produced in the electron flavour eigenstate, undergo flavour change on
their way to the Earth, thus resolving the solar neutrino problem. The
experiment was conducted in three phases, differing by the method for measuring
the neutral current rate. This short paper summarizes results from the third
phase of the experiment, which used an array of 36 strings of proportional
counters filled with $^3$He to detect neutrons from the neutral-current
reaction. When the data from the three phases is combined with solar and the
KamLAND neutrino oscillation experiments, the resulting limits on the solar
neutrino mixing angle and mass-squared difference are $\theta_{12} =
