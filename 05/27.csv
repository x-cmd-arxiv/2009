where only photometry and spectroscopic redshifts are available. This technique
provides a powerful measure of particular extinction features such as the UV
bump at 2175\A, which has been observed in environments ranging from the Milky
Way to high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Knowledge of the typical strength
of the UV bump as a function of environment and redshift is crucial for
converting restframe UV flux into star formation rates. The UV bump will impart
a unique signature as it moves through various filters due to redshifting; its
presence can therefore be disentangled from other stellar population effects.
The utility of this technique is demonstrated with a large sample of galaxies
drawn from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. The observed B-R color of
star-forming galaxies at 0.6<z<1.4 disfavors the presence of a UV bump as
strong as observed in the Milky Way, and instead favors restframe UV
(1800A<lambda<3000A) attenuation curves similar to the Milky Way without a UV
bump or a power-law with index delta=-0.7. Stronger constraints on the strength
of the UV bump in galaxies can be achieved if independent constraints on the
V-band optical depth are available.

process based on a count of the number of events observed due to the process.
In some experiments, one makes several counts of the number of events, using
different instruments, different event detection algorithms, or observations
over multiple time intervals. We demonstrate how to generalize the classical
frequentist upper limit calculation to the case where multiple counts of events
are made over one or more time intervals using several (not necessarily
independent) procedures. We show how different choices of the rank ordering of
possible outcomes in the space of counts correspond to applying different
levels of significance to the various measurements. We propose an ordering that
is matched to the sensitivity of the different measurement procedures and show
that in typical cases it gives stronger upper limits than other choices. As an
example, we show how this method can be applied to searches for
gravitational-wave bursts, where multiple burst-detection algorithms analyse
the same data set, and demonstrate how a single combined upper limit can be set
on the gravitational-wave burst rate.

larger than the speed of light would, if they exist, play a fundamental role as

mechanics would not be ultimate fundamental properties of space-time and

are expected to couple very weakly to ""ordinary"" matter, but they can
spontaneously decay by emitting standard particles until they reach a speed
equal or close to that of light. They would then form a cosmological sea where
the relation between inertial and gravitational masses would differ from
conventional Physics. Superbradyons may be at the origin of cosmological and
astrophysical phenomena usually associated to dark matter, dark energy and
inflation. They can also be a source of conventional cosmic rays of all
energies. In such a scenario, superbradyon spontaneous decays and similar
interactions would be candidates to explain data on electron and positron
abundances (PAMELA, ATIC, Fermi LAT, HESS, PPB-BETS) considered as possible
dark matter signatures. Superbradyons emitting this radiation may even have
comparatively small inertial masses, and kinetic energies not far away from
those of the decay events. But in most cases, such ""light"" superbradyons could
not be found at accelerator experiments. We comment on several basic physics

topic with contrasting results arguing in favour or against the presence of
significant dark mass within the effective radius and the change with
luminosity and mass. In order to address this question, we investigate here the
global mass - to - light ratio $\Upsilon(r) = M(r)/L(r)$ of a sample of 21
lenses observed within the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We follow the usual
approach of modeling the galaxy as a two component systems, but we use a
phenomenological ansatz for $\Upsilon(r)$, proposed by some of us in Tortora et
al. (2007), able to smoothly interpolate between constant $M/L$ models and a
wide class of dark matter haloes. The resulting galaxy model is then fitted to
the data on the Einstein radius and velocity dispersion. Our phenomenological
model turns out to be in well agreement with the data suggesting the presence
of massive dark matter haloes in order to explain the lensing and dynamics
properties of the SLACS lenses. According to the values of the dark matter mass
fraction, we argue that the halo may play a significant role in the inner
regions probed by the data, but such a conclusion strongly depends on the
adopted initial mass function of the stellar population. Finally, we find that
the dark matter mass fraction within $R_{eff}$ scales with both the total
luminosity and stellar mass in such a way that more luminous (and hence more
massive) galaxies have a larger dark matter content.

gas-phase neutral atoms rely increasingly on laser cooling and optical,

localization with sub-micron uncertainty. Difficult to achieve in free space,
this goal is further frustrated by atom-surface interactions if the desired
atomic placement approaches within several hundred nanometers of a solid
surface, as can be the case in setups incorporating monolithic dielectric
optical resonators such as microspheres, microtoroids, microdisks or photonic
crystal defect cavities. Typically in such scenarios, the smallest atom-surface
separation at which the van der Waals interaction can be neglected is taken to
be the optimal localization point for associated trapping schemes, but this
sort of conservative strategy generally compromises the achievable cavity QED
coupling strength. Here we suggest a new approach to the design of optical
dipole traps for atom confinement near surfaces that exploits strong surface

It was therefore surprising to find that Cyg OB2 No. 8A (P = 21.9 d) does show

model for the relativistic electron generation (including cooling and
advection) and the radiative transfer of the synchrotron emission through the

Cyg OB2 No. 8A does extend far enough beyond the free-free absorption region to

F is weight two if it is de Rham with Hodge-Tate weights 0 and -1 equally

curve has this property. The purpose of this paper is to establish a variety of
results concerning odd weight two representations of totally real fields in as

existing results. Three of our main results are as follows. (1) We prove a
modularity lifting theorem for odd weight two representations, extending a
theorem of Kisin to include representations which are not potentially
crystalline. (2) We show that essentially any odd weight two representation is
potentially modular, following the ideas of Taylor. (3) We show that one can
lift essentially any odd residual representation to a minimally ramified weight
two p-adic representation, using some ideas of Khare-Wintenberger. As an
application of these results we show that if rho is a sufficiently irreducible
odd weight two p-adic representation of a totally real field F and either F has
odd degree or rho is indecomposable at some finite place away from p then rho
occurs as the Tate module of a GL_2-type abelian variety. This establishes some

consider the endogenous effect of R&D investment. We also distinguish between
the estimated long and short run results. Our results based on a sample of 23
countries over the period 1992-2004 indicate that both public and private
investments in R&D are complementary. By establishing an endogenous growth
model, the estimates indicate that public and private R&D depends on the host
country's human capital investment. Results indicate that foreign direct
investment is a more significant spillover channel than imports.

present low-resolution (64 < lambda / dlambda < 124), mid-infrared (20-38
micron) spectra of 23 high-redshift ULIRGs detected in the Bootes field of the
NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey. All of the sources were selected to have 1) fnu(24
micron) > 0.5 mJy; 2) R-[24] > 14 Vega mag; and 3) a prominent rest-frame 1.6
micron stellar photospheric feature redshifted into Spitzer's 3-8 micron IRAC
bands. Of these, 20 show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
usually interpreted as signatures of star formation. The PAH features indicate
redshifts in the range 1.5 < z < 3.0, with a mean of <z>=1.96 and a dispersion
of 0.30. Based on local templates, these sources have extremely large infrared
luminosities, comparable to that of submillimeter galaxies. Our results confirm
previous indications that the rest-frame 1.6 micron stellar bump can be
efficiently used to select highly obscured starforming galaxies at z~2, and
that the fraction of starburst-dominated ULIRGs increases to faint 24 micron
flux densities. Using local templates, we find that the observed narrow
redshift distribution is due to the fact that the 24 micron detectability of
PAH-rich sources peaks sharply at z = 1.9. We can analogously explain the
broader redshift distribution of Spitzer-detected AGN-dominated ULIRGs based on
the shapes of their SEDs. Finally, we conclude that z~2 sources with a
detectable 1.6 micron stellar opacity feature lack sufficient AGN emission to
veil the 7.7 micron PAH band.

onto galaxies to trigger star formation and feed central black holes. Here we
explore the correlations between the intrinsic properties of void galaxies and
the linearity R_L of void filaments (degree of filament's straightness). We
focus on void regions since the bridge effect of filaments should be most
conspicuous in the pristine underdense regions like voids. Analyzing the
Millennium-Run semi-analytic galaxy catalogue, we identify void filaments
consisting of more than four galaxies (three edges) and calculate the means of
central black hole mass, star formation rate, and stellar mass as a function of
R_L. It is shown that the void galaxies constituting more straight filaments
tend to have higher luminosity, more massive central black holes and higher
star formation rate. Among the three properties, the central black hole mass is
most strongly correlated with R_L. It is also shown that the dark halos
constituting straight filaments tend to have similar masses. Our results
suggest that the fuel-supply for central black holes and star formation of void
galaxies occurs most efficiently along straight void filaments whose potential
wells are generated by similar-mass dark halos.

exacerbated by the latest $HST$ proper motion measurements. We study the
effects of varying the total Local Group mass, the relative mass of the Milky
Way and M31, the proper motion of M31, and the proper motion of the LMC on this
problem. Over a large part of this parameter-space we find that tides from M31
are insignificant. For a range of LMC proper motions approximately $3\sigma$
higher than the mean and total Local Group mass $> 3.5\times 10^{12} M_\odot$,
M31 can provide a significant torque to the LMC orbit. However, if the LMC is
bound to the MW, then M31 is found to have negligible effect on its motion and
the origin of the high angular momentum of the system remains a puzzle.
Finally, we use the timing argument to calculate the total mass of the MW-LMC
system based on the assumption that they are encountering each other for the
first time, their previous perigalacticon being a Hubble time ago, obtaining
$M_{\rm MW} + M_{\rm LMC} = (8.7 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{11} M_\odot$.

Surveying the Agents of a Galaxy's Evolution (SAGE) legacy survey, we have
studied the variations of the dust composition and abundance across the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Such variations are expected, as the explosive events
which have lead to the formation of the many HI shells observed should have
affected the dust properties. Using a model and comparing with a reference
spectral energy distribution from our Galaxy, we deduce the relative abundance
variations of small dust grains across the LMC. We examined the infrared color
ratios as well as the relative abundances of very small grains (VSGs) and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) relative to the big grain (BG)
abundance. Results show that each dust component could have different origins
or evolution in the interstellar medium (ISM). The VSG abundance traces the
star formation activity and could result from shattering of larger grains,
whereas the PAH abundance increases around molecular clouds as well as in the
stellar bar, where they could have been injected into the ISM during mass loss
from old stars.

however, the properties of some can also be explained if they are dMe stars or
active galaxies. We investigate the CV number density towards the bulge and
find that the number of observed candidate CVs is consistent with or lower than
the number expected for a constant CV-to-star ratio that is fixed to the local
value. The X-ray properties of two likely CVs are similar to those of the
faint, hard X-ray sources in the Galactic-Center region that have been
explained by (mainly) magnetic CVs. If our candidates belong to the same
population, they would be the first members to be optically identified; optical
or infrared identification of their Galactic-Center analogs would be impossible
due to the higher obscuration. We speculate that all Galactic hard X-ray

emission from NGC7538 IRS1 is dominated by a collimated ionized wind. We have
re-analyzed high angular resolution VLA archive data from 6 cm to 7 mm, and
measured separately the flux density from the compact bipolar core and the
extended (1.5"" - 3"") lobes. We find that the flux density of the core is
proportional to the frequency to the power of alpha, with alpha being about
0.7. The frequency dependence of the total flux density is slightly steeper
with alpha = 0.8. A massive optically thick hypercompact core with a steep
density gradient can explain this frequency dependence, but it cannot explain
the extremely broad recombination line velocities observed in this source.
Neither can it explain why the core is bipolar rather than spherical, nor the
observed decrease of 4% in the flux density in less than 10 years. An ionized
wind modulated by accretion is expected to vary, because the accretion flow
from the surrounding cloud will vary over time. BIMA and CARMA continuum
observations at 3 mm show that the free-free emission still dominates at 3 mm.
HCO+ J = 1 - 0 observations combined with FCRAO single dish data show a clear

results, based on the symmetry inherent in the channel, are provided to
characterize this transition density. A low complexity procedure for computing
the channel capacity is obtained using these results. Numerical capacity
computations for QPSK show that 8-bin phase quantization of the received signal
recovers more than 80-85 % of the capacity attained with unquantized

its own position in some reference frame. This paper considers this problem,
which has applications to surveillance or maintaining an orbit. In many of
these applications it is difficult for B to directly sense the location of A,
e.g. when all that B can sense is the intensity of a signal emitted by A. This
intensity does, however provide a measure of the distance. We propose a
nonlinear periodic continuous time control law that achieves the objective.
Fundamentally, B must exploit its motion to estimate the location of A, and use
its best instantaneous estimate of where A resides, to move itself to achieve
the ultimate circumnavigation objective. The control law we propose marries
these dual goals and is globally exponentially convergent. We show through
simulations that it also permits B to approximately achieve this objective when
A experiences slow, persistent and potentially nontrivial drift.

of Yohkoh hard X-ray imaging, which was achieved after the intensive
investigations on this celebrated event. Through an uncertainty analysis, we
show that the hard X-ray coronal source is located much closer to the soft
X-ray loop in the re-calibrated HXT images than in the original ones.
Specifically, the centroid of the M1-band (23--33 keV) coronal source is above
the brightest pixel of the SXT loop by ~5000+/-1000 km (~9600 km in the
original data); and above the apex of the 30% brightness contour of the SXT
loop by ~2000+/-1000 km (~7000 km in the original data). We suggest that this
change may naturally account for the fact that the spectrum of the coronal
emission was reported to be extremely hard below ~20 keV in the pre-calibration
investigations, whereas it has been considerably softer in the literature since
Sato's re-calibration circa 1999. Still, the coronal spectrum is flatter at
lower energies than at higher energies, owing to the lack of a similar source
in the L-band (14--23 keV), which remains a puzzle.

achievable by combining future galaxy redshift surveys based on the radio HI
emission line with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the {\sl Planck}

baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) length scale. In the second method we utilize
additional information encoded in the galaxy power spectrum including galaxy
bias from velocity-space distortions and the growth of cosmic structure. We
find that a radio synthesis array with about 10 per cent of the collecting area
of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), equipped with a wide ($10-100 ~ {\rm
deg}^2$) field-of-view, would have the capacity to perform a $20{,}000 ~ {\rm
deg}^2$ redshift survey to a maximum redshift $z_{\rm max} \sim 0.8$ and
thereby produce dark energy measurements that are competitive with surveys
likely to be undertaken by optical telescopes around 2015. There would then be
powerful arguments for adding collecting area to such a `Phase-1' SKA because
of the square-law scaling of survey speed with telescope sensitivity for HI
surveys, compared to the linear scaling for optical redshift surveys. The full
SKA telescope should, by performing a $20{,}000 ~ {\rm deg}^2$ HI redshift
survey to $z_{\rm max} \sim 2$ around 2020, yield an accurate measurement of
cosmological parameters independent of CMB datasets. Combining CMB ({\sl
Planck}) and galaxy power spectrum (SKA) measurements will drive errors in the
dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$ well below the 1 per cent level.
The major systematic uncertainty in these forecasts is the lack of direct
information about the mass function of high-redshift HI-emitting galaxies.

energy and incompressibility at the saturation density of asymmetric nuclear
matter are given exactly up to 4th-order in the isospin asymmetry delta =(rho_n
- rho_p)/rho using 11 characteristic parameters defined at the normal nuclear
density rho_0. Using an isospin- and momentum-dependent modified Gogny (MDI)
interaction and the SHF approach with 63 popular Skyrme interactions, we have
systematically studied the isospin dependence of the saturation properties of
asymmetric nuclear matter, particularly the incompressibility $K_{sat}(\delta
)=K_{0}+K_{sat,2}\delta ^{2}+K_{sat,4}\delta ^{4}+O(\delta ^{6})$ at the
saturation density. Our results show that the magnitude of the high-order
$K_{sat,4}$ parameter is generally small compared to that of the $K_{\sat,2}$
parameter. The latter essentially characterizes the isospin dependence of the
incompressibility at the saturation density and can be expressed as
$K_{sat,2}=K_{sym}-6L-\frac{J_{0}}{K_{0}}L$, Furthermore, we have constructed a
phenomenological modified Skyrme-like (MSL) model which can reasonably describe
the general properties of symmetric nuclear matter and the symmetry energy
predicted by both the MDI model and the SHF approach. The results indicate that
the high-order $J_{0}$ contribution to $K_{sat,2}$ generally cannot be
neglected. In addition, it is found that there exists a nicely linear
correlation between $K_{sym}$ and $L$ as well as between $J_{0}/K_{0}$ and
$K_{0}$. These correlations together with the empirical constraints on $K_{0}$,
$L$, $E_{sym}(\rho_{0})$ and the nucleon effective mass lead to an estimate of
$K_{sat,2}=-370\pm 120$ MeV.

low energy of the outgoing real photon. This regime allows one to directly
access the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon in a VCS experiment. In
the derivation of the low energy theorem for VCS that exists in the literature,
the low energy limit taken for virtual initial photons does not match on that
for real photons, when one approaches the initial photon's mass shell. While
this problem has for a long time been attributed to the non-analyticity of the
Compton amplitude with respect to the photon virtuality, I demonstrate that it
is merely due to an ill-defined low energy limit for VCS, on one hand, and to a
particular way of constructing the VCS amplitude, use in the literature, on the
other. I provide a uniform description of low energy Compton scattering with
real and virtual photons by defining a Lorentz-covariant operator sub-basis for
Compton scattering in that regime, that has six independent structures.
Correspondingly, six new generalized polarizabilities are introduced in the
Breit frame. These polarizabilities are defined as continuous functions of the
photon virtuality and at the real photon point match onto the nucleon
polarizabilities known from real Compton scattering.

advected by a two-dimensional large-scale flow, is examined for the case for
which the reaction equations contain delay terms. Previous theoretical
investigations have shown that, in the absence of delay terms and in a regime
where diffusion can be neglected (large P\'eclet number), the emergent spatial
structures are filamental and characterized by a single scaling regime with a
H\""older exponent that depends on the rate of convergence of the reactive
processes and the strength of the stirring measured by the average stretching
rate. In the presence of delay terms, we show that for sufficiently small
scales all interacting fields should share the same spatial structure, as found
in the absence of delay terms. Depending on the strength of the stirring and
the magnitude of the delay time, two further scaling regimes that are unique to
the delay system may appear at intermediate length scales. An expression for
the transition length scale dividing small-scale and intermediate-scale regimes
is obtained and the scaling behavior of the scalar field is explained. The
theoretical results are illustrated by numerical calculations for two types of
reaction models, both based on delay differential equations, coupled to a
two-dimensional chaotic advection flow. The first corresponds to a single
reactive scalar and the second to a nonlinear biological model that includes
nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. As in the no-delay case, the presence
of asymmetrical couplings among the biological species results in a non-generic
scaling behavior.

A global O-Na abundance anti-correlation is observed in globular

disk.
  Methods. We combine open cluster abundance ratios of O and Na from
high-resolution spectroscopic studies in the literature and normalize them to a
common solar scale. We compare the open cluster abundances against the globular
clusters and disk field.
  Results. We find that the different environments show different abundance
patterns. The open clusters do not show the O-Na anti-correlation at the
extreme O-depletion / Na-enhancement as observed in globular clusters.
Furthermore, the high Na abundances in open clusters do not match the disk
field stars. If real, it may be suggesting that the dissolution of present-day
open clusters is not a significant contribution to building the Galactic disk.
Large-scale homogeneous studies of clusters and field will further confirm the
reality of the Na enhancement.

the buoyant rise of magnetic loops due to the Parker instability. At the
initial state, we assumed a gravitationally stratified disk consisting of the
cool layer ($T \sim 10^3$ K), warm layer ($T \sim 10^4$ K), and hot layer ($T
\sim 10^5$ K). Simulation box is a local part of the disk containing the
equatorial plane. The gravitational field is approximated by that of a point
mass at the galactic center. The self-gravity, and the effects of the galactic
rotation are ignored. Numerical results indicate that the length of the
magnetic loops emerging from the disk is determined by the scale height of the
hot layer ($\sim$ 100 pc at 1 kpc from the Galactic center). The loop length,
velocity gradient along the loops and large velocity dispersions at their foot
points are consistent with the NANTEN observations. We also show that the loops
become top-heavy when the curvature of the loop is sufficiently small, so that
the rising loop accumulates the overlying gas faster than sliding it down along
the loop. This mechanism is similar to that of the formation of solar
chromospheric arch filaments. The molecular loops emerge from the low
temperature layer just like the dark filaments observed in the H$\alpha$ image
of the emerging flux region of the sun.

excellent spectral sensitivity enables us to measure the metal abundances of O,
Ne, Mg, Si and Fe of the ISM for the first time. The resultant abundance
pattern of O, Mg, Si, and Fe is consistent with that of the new solar abundance

cast into a form of a friction force. Here, for the first time a link between

This allows the theories developed for the stopping power calculation, such as
the quantum T-matrix approach, to be applied to the problem of collisional

the problem of estimating an unknown parameter having a sparse representation.
Specifically, we consider the setting in which a sparsely representable
deterministic parameter vector is to be estimated from measurements corrupted
by Gaussian noise, and derive a lower bound on the mean-squared error (MSE)
achievable in this setting. To this end, an appropriate definition of bias in
the sparse setting is developed, and the constrained Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is
obtained. This bound is shown to equal the CRB of an estimator with knowledge
of the support set, for almost all feasible parameter values. Consequently, in
the unbiased case, our bound is identical to the MSE of the oracle estimator.
Combined with the fact that the CRB is achieved at high signal-to-noise ratios
by the maximum likelihood technique, our result provides a new interpretation
for the common practice of using the oracle estimator as a gold standard
against which practical approaches are compared.

Galaxy MCG--6-30-15, broad iron-K lines have been found in several other
Seyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar mass black holes and even from
accreting neutron stars. The iron-K line is prominent in the reflection
spectrum created by the hard X-ray continuum irradiating dense accreting
matter. Relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the strong
gravity and spin of the black hole. The accompanying iron-L line emission
should be detectable when the iron abundance is high. Here we report the first
discovery of both iron-K and L emission, using XMM-Newton observations of the
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxy 1H0707-495. The bright Fe-L emission has enabled
us, for the first time, to detect a reverberation lag of 30 s between the
direct X-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the hole.
The observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing time
of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. The combination of
spectral and timing data on 1H0707-495 provides strong evidence that we are
witnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction of
a light-minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly-spinning, massive black
hole.

tori which are undetected in X-rays are likely to be Compton thick. Our

such walkers take? We analyze an iterative numerical solution to this
reconstruction problem, in particular, given the empirical mean occupation
times of the walkers. In the process, a result concerning the differentiation
of a matrix pseudoinverse is given, which may be of independent interest. We
then consider the existence of a choice of weights for the given occupation
times, formulating a natural conjecture to the effect that -- barring obvious
obstructions -- a solution always exists. It is shown that the conjecture holds
for a class of graphs that includes all trees and complete graphs. Several open
problems are discussed.

is known that the streaming instability develops and dust density concentration
occurs in a situation where the initial dust density is uniform. This work
considers the effect of initial dust density gradient vertical to the midplane.
Dust and gas are treated as different fluids. Pressure of dust fluid is assumed
to be zero. The gas friction time is assumed to be constant. Axisymmetric
two-dimensional numerical simulation was performed using the spectral method.
We found that an instability develops with a growth rate on the order of the
Keplerian angular velocity even if the gas friction time multiplied by the
Keplerian angular velocity is as small as 0.001.
  This instability is powered by two sources: (1) the vertical shear of the
azimuthal velocity, and (2) the relative motion of dust and gas coupled with
the dust density fluctuation due to advection. This instability diffuses dust
by turbulent advection and the maximum dust density decreases. This means that
the dust concentration by the streaming instability which is seen in the case
of a uniform initial dust density becomes ineffective as dust density gradient
increases by the dust settling toward the midplane.

that for fixed rank their Ehrhart polynomials are computable in polynomial
time. The proof relies on the geometry of these polytopes as well as a new
refined analysis of the evaluation of Todd polynomials.
  Second, we discuss theoretical results regarding the algebraic combinatorics
of matroid polytopes. We discuss two conjectures about the h^*-vector and
coefficients of Ehrhart polynomials of matroid polytopes and provide
theoretical and computational evidence for their validity. We also explore a
variant of White's conjecture which states that every matroid polytope has a
regular unimodular triangulation. We provide extensive computational evidence
supporting this new conjecture and propose a combinatorial condition on
simplices sufficient for unimodularity.
  Finally, motivated by recent work on algorithmic theory for non-linear and
multicriteria matroid optimization, we have developed algorithms and heuristics
aimed at practical solutions of large instances of these difficult problems.
Our methods primarily use the local adjacency structure inherent in matroid
polytopes to pivot to feasible solutions which may or may not be optimal. We
also present a modified breadth-first-search heuristic that uses adjacency to
enumerate a subset of feasible solutions. We present other heuristics, and
provide computational evidence supporting these new techniques. We implemented

results are collected in a database, which can be used in conjunction with
stellar evolution and population synthesis calculations involving the AGB. We
have computed a grid of 746 spherically symmetric COMARCS atmospheres covering
effective temperatures between 2400 and 4000K, surface gravities from log(g) =
0.0 to -1.0, metallicities ranging from the solar value down to one tenth of it
and C/O ratios in the interval between 1.05 and 5.0. Subsequently, we used
these models to create synthetic low resolution spectra and photometric data
for a large number of filter systems. The tables including the results are
electronically available. We have selected some of the most commonly used
colours in order to discuss their behaviour as a function of the stellar
parameters. A comparison with measured data shows that down to 2800K the
agreement between predictions and observations of carbon stars is good. Below
this limit the synthetic colours are much too blue. The obvious reason for
these problems is the neglect of circumstellar reddening and structural changes
due to pulsation and mass loss.

an expression for the direct correlation function and use it to perform a
bifurcation analysis. We compare the results with those obtained with a second
and a third virial approximation of this function. All three approximations
lead to the same conclusion: there is a terminal polydispersity beyond which
the smectic phase is less stable than the columnar phase. This result is in
agreement with previous Monte Carlo simulations conducted on a freely rotating
length-polydisperse hard spherocylinder fluid, although the theories always
overestimate the terminal polydispersity because the nematic-columnar phase
transition is first order and exhibits a wide coexistence gap. Both, the
fundamental-measure functional and the third virial approximation, predict a
metastable nematic-nematic demixing. Conversely, according to second virial
approximation this demixing might be stable at high values of the
polydispersity, something that is observed neither in simulations nor in
experiments. The results of the fundamental-measure functional are
quantitatively superior to those obtained from the other two approximations.
Thus this functional provides a promising route to map out the full phase

decreasing \emph{and} increasing with radius. These results are of particular
importance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematic
structure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast-

of the survival probability from the Lifshitz tail effect for the associated
operator. In particular, the upper bound is proved in fairly general settings
and is shown to be sharp in the case of the Brownian motion in the Poissonian
obstacles. As an application, we derive the quenched asymptotics for the
Brownian motion in traps distributed according to a random perturbation of the

Differently from other works, the current density distribution throughout the

modeling the ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet trilayer as a series of parallel
resistances. The validity of the main postulated hypothesis, which states that
the current density vector is perpendicular to the sample plane, has been
verified by numerically solving the Poisson equation. Our results show that the
nonuniform current density distribution is a source of asymmetry for the

characterized by well defined localized pre-switching oscillation modes.

power-law degrees with exponent $\tau\in [1,2)$. To this end we equip the edges
with exponential weights. We derive the distributional limit of the minimal
weight of a path between typical vertices in the network and the number of
edges on the minimal weight path, which can be computed in terms of the
Poisson-Dirichlet distribution. We explicitly describe these limits via the
construction of an infinite limiting object describing the FPP problem in the
densely connected core of the network. We consider two separate cases, namely,
the {\it original CM}, in which each edge, regardless of its multiplicity,
receives an independent exponential weight, as well as the {\it erased CM}, for
which there is an independent exponential weight between any pair of direct
neighbors. While the results are qualitatively similar, surprisingly the
limiting random variables are quite different.
  Our results imply that the flow carrying properties of the network are
markedly different from either the mean-field setting or the locally tree-like
setting, which occurs as $\tau>2$, and for which the hopcount between typical
vertices scales as $\log{n}$. In our setting the hopcount is tight and has an
explicit limiting distribution, showing that one can transfer information
remarkably quickly between different vertices in the network. This efficiency
has a down side in that such networks are remarkably fragile to directed
attacks. These results continue a general program by the authors to obtain a
complete picture of how random disorder changes the inherent geometry of

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/200912023",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There have been recent claims that a significant fraction of type 2 AGN
accrete close or even above the Eddington limit. In type 2 AGN the bolometric
luminosity (L_b) is generally inferred from the [OIII] emission line luminosity
(L_OIII). The key issue, in order to estimate the bolometric luminosity in
these AGN, is therefore to know the bolometric correction to be applied to
L_OIII. A complication arises from the fact that the observed L_OIII is
affected by extinction, likely due to dust within the narrow line region. The
extinction-corrected [OIII] luminosity (L^c_OIII) is a better estimator of the
nuclear luminosity than L_OIII. However, so far only the bolometric correction
to be applied to the uncorrected L_OIII has been evaluated. This paper is
devoted to estimate the bolometric correction C_OIII=L_b/L^c_OIII in order to
derive the Eddington ratios for the type 2 AGN in a sample of SDSS objects. We
have collected from the literature 61 sources with reliable estimate of both
L^c_OIII and X-ray luminosities (L_X). To estimate C_OIII, we combined the
observed correlation between L^c_OIII and L_X with the X-ray bolometric
correction. We found, contrary to previous studies, a linear correlation
between L^c_OIII and L_X. We estimated C_OIII using the luminosity-dependent
X-ray bolometric correction of Marconi et al. (2004), and we found a mean value
of C_OIII in the luminosity ranges log L_OIII=38-40, 40-42, and 42-44 of 87,
142 and 454 respectively. We used it to calculate the Eddington ratio
distribution of type 2 SDSS AGN at 0.3<z<0.4 and we found that these sources
are not accreting near their Eddington limit, contrary to previous claims.

macroscopic and molecular scales, and we attempt to unify them into a
comprehensive model for venation formation. We begin with a set of principles
to guide an abstract model of venation formation, from which we show how
patterns in plant development are related to the representation of global
distance information locally as cellular-level signals. Venation formation, in
particular, is a function of distances between cells and their locations. The
first principle, that auxin is produced at a constant rate in all cells, leads
to a (Poisson) reaction-diffusion equation. Equilibrium solutions uniquely
codify information about distances, thereby providing cells with the signal to
begin differentiation from ground to vascular. A uniform destruction hypothesis
and scaling by cell size leads to a more biologically-relevant (Helmholtz)
model, and simulations demonstrate its capability to predict leaf and root
auxin distributions and venation patterns. The mathematical development is
centered on properties of the distance map, and provides a mechanism by which
global information about shape can be presented locally to individual cells.
The principles provide the foundation for an elaboration of these models in a
companion paper \cite{plos-paper2}, and together they provide a framework for
understanding organ- and plant-scale organization.

destroyed. 3He is consumed, at variable rates. The process continues on the
AGB, where however moderate mass circulation rates have little effect on Li due
to the short time available. O-rich and C-rich stars show different histories

variability in apparently single Wolf-Rayet stars brighter than ~12.5. In this
first paper we characterize the various forms of variability detected and
distinguish several separate groups. For each star in our sample, we obtained
4-5 high-resolution spectra with a signal-to-noise ratio ~100. Our ultimate
goal is to identify new candidates presenting variability that potentially
comes from Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIR).
  Out of a sample of 25 stars, 10 were found to display large-scale changes of
which 4 are of CIR-type (WR1, WR115, WR120 and WR134). The star WR134 was
already known to show such changes from previous studies. Three WN8 stars
present a different type of large-scale variability and we believe deserve a
group of their own. Also, all three WC9d stars in our sample present
large-scale variability, but it remains to be checked if these are binaries, as
many dust-making WR stars are double. Finally, of the remaining stars, 10 were
found to show small-amplitude spectral changes which we attribute to normal
line-profile variability due to inhomogeneities in the wind, and 5 were found
to show no spectral variability, as far as can be concluded from the data in
hand.
  Follow-up studies are required to identify potential periods for our
candidates showing CIR-type changes and eventually estimate a rotation rate for
these WR stars.

  characteristic classes","26 pages",,,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For any (n-1)-dimensional simplicial complex, we construct a particular
n-dimensional complex vector bundle over the associated Davis-Januszkiewicz
space whose Chern classes are given by the elementary symmetric polynomials in
the generators of the Stanley Reisner algebra. We show that the isomorphism
type of this complex vector bundle as well as of its realification are
completely determined by its characteristic classes. This allows us to show
that coloring properties of the simplicial complex are reflected by splitting
properties of this bundle and vice versa. Similar question are also discussed
for 2n-dimensional real vector bundles with particular prescribed
characteristic Pontrjagin and Euler classes. We also analyze which of these
bundles admit a complex structure. It turns out that all these bundles are
closely related to the tangent bundles of quasitoric manifolds and moment angle
complexes.
