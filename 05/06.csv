FERMI and HESS in the electron + positron flux can be interpreted in terms of
DM annihilations or decays into leptonic final states. Final states into tau's
or 4mu give the best fit to the excess. However, in the annihilation scenario,
they are incompatible with photon and neutrino constraints, unless DM has a
quasi-constant density profile. Final states involving electrons are less
constrained but poorly fit the excess, unless hidden sector radiation makes
their energy spectrum smoother, allowing a fit to all the data with a
combination of leptonic modes. In general, DM lighter than about a TeV cannot
fit the excesses, so PAMELA should find a greater positron fraction at higher
energies. The DM interpretation can be tested by FERMI gamma observations above
10 GeV: if the electronic excess is everywhere in the DM halo, inverse Compton
scattering on ambient light produces a well-predicted gamma excess that FERMI
should soon detect.

same saturation issues as the z ~ 6 HI Ly-alpha forest and, therefore, will not
be a sensitive probe of HeII reionization. However, there are several factors
that make HeII Ly-alpha absorption more sensitive than HI Ly-alpha. We show
that observations of HeII Ly-alpha and Ly-beta Gunn-Peterson troughs can
provide a relatively model-independent constraint on the volume-averaged HeII
fraction of x_HeII >~ 0.1. This bound derives from first using the most
underdense regions in the HeII forest to constrain the local HeII fraction and,
then, assuming photoionization equilibrium with the maximum allowed
photoionization rate to calculate the ionization state of nearby gas. It is
possible to evade this constraint by a factor of ~2, but only if the HeII were
reionized recently. We argue that HeII Ly-alpha Gunn-Peterson troughs observed
in the spectra of Q0302-003 and HE2347-4342 signify the presence of >~ 10
comoving Mpc patches in which x_HeII > 0.03. This is a factor of 20 improvement
over previous constraints from these spectra and 100 times stronger than the
tightest constraint on the HI volume-filling fraction from the z>6 HI Lyman
forest.

results, specifically the CRE spectrum measured by H.E.S.S. and especially the
positron fraction reported by PAMELA between 1 and 100 GeV, that class of
models fails to provide a consistent interpretation. Rather, we find that
several combinations of parameters, involving both the pulsar and dark matter

thermonuclear events, any such disc must be expelled from the white dwarf
vicinity, as the nuclear energy yield greatly exceeds its binding energy. We
suggest instead that the outbursts of RS Oph are thermal--viscous instabilities
in a disc irradiated by the central accreting white dwarf. The distinctive
feature of RS Oph is the very large size of its accretion disc. Given this, it
fits naturally into a consistent picture of systems with unstable accretion
discs. This picture explains the presence and speed of the jets, the brightness
and duration of the outburst, and its rise time and linear decay, as well as
the faintness of the quiescence. By contrast, the hitherto standard picture of
recurrent thermonuclear explosions has a number of severe difficulties. These
include the presence of jets, the faintness of quiescence, and the fact the the
accretion disc must be unstable unless it is far smaller than any reasonable
estimate.

The RMS proper motion profile is also consistent with being flat near the

$\ell_1 / \ell_{\infty}$-regularization yields improved statistical efficiency
if the overlap parameter is large enough ($\alpha > 2/3$), but has \emph{worse}
statistical efficiency than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small
overlap ($\alpha < 2/3$). These results indicate that some caution needs to be
exercised in the application of $\ell_1/\ell_\infty$ block regularization: if
the data does not match its structure closely enough, it can impair statistical
performance relative to computationally less expensive schemes.

that the X-ray emitting gas has been strongly perturbed by recent outbursts
from the central AGN and also by motion of the central dominant galaxy relative
to the group gas. The NGC 5044 group hosts many small radio quiet cavities with
a nearly isotropic distribution, cool filaments, a semi-circular cold front and
a two-armed spiral shaped feature of cool gas. A GMRT observation of NGC 5044
at 610 MHz shows the presence of extended radio emission with a ""torus-shaped""
morphology. The largest X-ray filament appears to thread the radio torus,
suggesting that the lower entropy gas within the filament is material being
uplifted from the center of the group. The radio emission at 235 MHz is much
more extended than the emission at 610 MHz, with little overlap between the two
frequencies. One component of the 235 MHz emission passes through the largest
X-ray cavity and is then deflected just behind the cold front. A second
detached radio lobe is also detected at 235 MHz beyond the cold front. All of
the smaller X-ray cavities in the center of NGC 5044 are undetected in the GMRT
observations. Since the smaller bubbles are probably no longer momentum driven
by the central AGN, their motion will be affected by the group ""weather"" as
they buoyantly rise outward. Hence, most of the enthalpy within the smaller
bubbles will likely be deposited near the group center and isotropized by the
group weather. The total mechanical power of the smaller radio quiet cavities
is $P_c = 9.2 \times 10^{41}$erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to suppress about
one-half of the total radiative cooling within the central 10 kpc. This is
consistent with the presence of H$\alpha$ emission within this region which
shows that at least some of the gas is able to cool.

our combined near-infrared and Spitzer photometry, we classify each source in
the cores as, among other things, background stars, galaxies, or embedded young
stellar objects (YSOs). L1152 contains three YSOs and L1228 has seven, but
neither L204C-2 nor L1155C-2 appear to contain any YSOs. We estimate an upper
limit of 7x10^-5 to 5x10^-4 solar luminosities for any undiscovered YSOs in our
cores. We also compute the line-of-sight extinction law towards each background
star. These measurements are averaged spatially, to create chi-squared maps of
the changes in the mid-infrared extinction law throughout our cores, and also
in different ranges of extinction. From the chi-squared maps we identify two
small regions in L1152 and L1228 where the outflows in those cores appear to be
destroying the larger dust grains, thus altering the extinction law in those
regions. On average, however, our extinction law is relatively flat from 3.6 to
24 microns for all ranges of extinction and in all four cores. From 3.6 to 8
microns this law is consistent with a dust model that includes larger dust
grains than the diffuse interstellar medium, which suggests grain growth has
occurred in our cores. At 24 microns, our extinction law is 2-4 times higher
than predicted by dust models. However, it is similar to other empirical
measurements.

that a pseudoscalar mass term \frac{\mu^2}{2} \tr (\phi\wedge \phi) for the
tensor field eliminates degrees of freedom associated with this field. Explicit
one loop calculations show that an additional coupling m\tr(\phi\wedge F)
(which can be eliminated classically by a tensor field shift) reintroduces
tensor field degrees of freedom. We attribute this to the lack of the
renormalizability in our vector-tensor model. We also explore a vector-tensor
model with a tensor field scalar mass term \frac {\mu^2}{2} \tr
(\phi\wedge\star \phi) and coupling m\tr(\phi\wedge \star F). We comment on the
Stueckelberg mechanism for mass generation in the Abelian version of the latter

in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory and their string theory duals. The operators are
defined for arbitrary contours on a two-sphere in space-time, and they were
conjectured to be captured perturbatively by 2d bosonic Yang-Mills theory. In
the AdS dual, they are described by pseudo-holomorphic string surfaces living
on a certain submanifold of AdS_5 x S^5. We show that the regularized area of
these string surfaces is invariant under area preserving diffeomorphisms of the

between the pseudo-holomorphicity equations and an auxiliary sigma-model on
S^3, which may help to construct new 1/8-BPS string solutions. We also show
that the conjectured relation to 2d Yang-Mills implies that a connected
correlator of two Wilson loops is computed by a Hermitian Gaussian two-matrix
model. On the AdS dual side, we argue that the connected correlator is
described by two disconnected disks interacting through the exchange of
supergravity modes, and we show that this agrees with the strong coupling

We compared two different estimators of the Star Formation Rate: the total

empirical IR templates, and the multiwavelength fit to the full galaxy SED. For
both estimates, we computed the SFR Density and the Specific SFR. The two SFR
tracers are roughly consistent, given the uncertainties involved. However, they
show a systematic trend, IR-based estimates exceeding the fit-based ones as the
SFR increases. We show that: a) at z>0.3, the SFR is well correlated with
stellar mass, and this relationship seems to steepen with redshift (using
IR-based SFRs); b) the contribution to the global SFRD by massive galaxies
increases with redshift up to ~2.5, more rapidly than for galaxies of lower
mass, but appears to flatten at higher z; c) despite this increase, the most
important contributors to the SFRD at any z are galaxies of about, or
immediately lower than, the characteristic stellar mass; d) at z~2, massive
galaxies are actively star-forming, with a median SFR 300 Msun/yr. During this
epoch, they assemble a substantial part of their final stellar mass; e) the
SSFR shows a clear bimodal distribution. The analysis of the SFRD and the SSFR
seems to support the downsizing scenario, according to which high mass galaxies
have formed their stars earlier and faster than their low mass counterparts. A
comparison with theoretical models indicates that they follow the global
increase in the SSFR with redshift and predict the existence of quiescent
galaxies even at z>1.5, but they systematically underpredict the average SSFR.

include the use of the same instrument for all Cepheid measurements across the

necessitating only a differential measurement of Cepheid fluxes and reducing
the largest systematic uncertainties in the determination of the fiducial SN Ia
luminosity. The NICMOS measurements reduce differential extinction in the host
galaxies by a factor of 5 over past optical data. Combined with an expanded of
240 SNe Ia at z<0.1 which define their magnitude-redshift relation, we find
H_0=74.2 +/-3.6, a 4.8% uncertainty including both statistical and systematic
errors. We show that the factor of 2.2 improvement in the precision of H_0 is a
significant aid to the determination of the equation-of-state of dark energy, w
= P/(rho c^2). Combined with the WMAP 5-year measurement of Omega_M h^2, we
find w= -1.12 +/- 0.12 independent of high-redshift SNe Ia or baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO). This result is also consistent with analyses based on the
combination of high-z SNe Ia and BAO. The constraints on w(z) now with high-z
SNe Ia and BAO are consistent with a cosmological constant and improved by a
factor of 3 from the refinement in H_0 alone. We show future improvements in

deformation corresponds to adding a potential which is unbounded below. In a 't
Hooft large N limit, the beta function for the triple trace deformation
vanishes, which is consistent with the near-boundary behavior of the bulk
fields. At the next order in the 1/N expansion, the triple trace couplings
exhibit non-trivial running, which we analyze explicitly in the limit of zero
't Hooft coupling, in which the model reduces to an $O(N)\times O(N)$ vector
model with large N. In this limit, we establish the existence of a perturbative
UV fixed point, and we comment on possible non-perturbative effects. We also
show that the bulk analysis leading to big crunch singularities extends to the
$\Zbar_k$ orbifold models dual to ABJM theory.

interaction of three coupled quantum fields for the atoms, molecules, and the

field to become a dynamical quantity whose behavior is linked in a nonlinear
manner to the atoms inside and where vacuum fluctuations have a more important
role than in free space. We develop and compare several methods for calculating
the dynamics of the atom-molecule conversion process with a coherently driven
cavity field. We first introduce an alternate operator representation for the
Hamiltonian from which we derive an improved form of mean field theory and an
approximate solution of the Heisenberg-Langevin (HL) equations that properly
accounts for quantum noise in the cavity field. It is shown that our improved
mean field theory corrects several deficiencies in traditional mean field
theory based on expectation values of annihilation/creation operators. Also, we
show by direct comparison to numerical solutions of the density matrix
equations that our approximate quantum solution of HL equations gives an
accurate description of weakly or undriven cavities where mean field theories
break down.

  RNA exhibits a variety of structural configurations. Here we consider a
structure to be tantamount to the noncrossing Watson-Crick and \pairGU-base
pairings (secondary structure) and additional cross-serial base pairs. These
interactions are called pseudoknots and are observed across the whole spectrum
of RNA functionalities. In the context of studying natural RNA structures,
searching for new ribozymes and designing artificial RNA, it is of interest to
find RNA sequences folding into a specific structure and to analyze their
induced neutral networks. Since the established inverse folding algorithms,
{\tt RNAinverse}, {\tt RNA-SSD} as well as {\tt INFO-RNA} are limited to RNA
secondary structures, we present in this paper the inverse folding algorithm
{\tt Inv} which can deal with 3-noncrossing, canonical pseudoknot structures.
  Results:
  In this paper we present the inverse folding algorithm {\tt Inv}. We give a
detailed analysis of {\tt Inv}, including pseudocodes. We show that {\tt Inv}
allows to design in particular 3-noncrossing nonplanar RNA pseudoknot
3-noncrossing RNA structures-a class which is difficult to construct via
dynamic programming routines. {\tt Inv} is freely available at
\url{http://www.combinatorics.cn/cbpc/inv.html}.
  Conclusions:
  The algorithm {\tt Inv} extends inverse folding capabilities to RNA
pseudoknot structures. In comparison with {\tt RNAinverse} it uses new ideas,
for instance by considering sets of competing structures. As a result, {\tt
Inv} is not only able to find novel sequences even for RNA secondary
structures, it does so in the context of competing structures that potentially
exhibit cross-serial interactions.

non-self-consistent T-matrix approach, we perform a comprehensive investigation
of the in-gap bound states induced by a localized single impurity in iron-based
superconductors. We focus on studying signatures associated with the
unconventional sign-changed s-wave pairing symmetry. For a non-magnetic
impurity, we find that there are two in-gap bounds, symmetric with respect to
zero energy, only in the sign changed s-wave pairing state, not in the
sign-unchanged s-wave state, due to the existence of non-trivial Andreev bound
states caused by the sign change. For a magnetic impurity, we find that due to
the breakdown of the local time-reversal symmetry, there exist only bound state
solutions (with orbital degeneracy) carrying one of the electron-spin
polarizations around the impurity. As increasing the scattering strength, the
system undergoes a quantum phase transition (level crossing) from a
spin-unpolarized ground state to a spin-polarized one. While the results for
the magnetic impurity are qualitatively similar in both the sign-changed and
sign-unchanged s-wave superconducting states, the bound states in the first
case are more robust and there is no $\pi$ phase shift of the SC gap near the
impurity in the strong scattering regime.

thin films of aging laponite suspension under tensile deformation field.
Aqueous suspension of laponite is known to undergo waiting time dependent
evolution of its micro-structure, also known as aging, which is accompanied by
an increase in the elastic modulus and relaxation time. In the velocity
controlled tensile deformation experiments, we observed that the dependence of
force and dissipated energy on velocity and initial thickness of the film is
intermediate to a Newtonian fluid and a yield stress fluid. For a fixed waiting
time, strain at break and dissipated energy increased with velocity, but
decreased with initial thickness. With increase in age, strain at break and
dissipated energy showed a decrease suggesting enhanced brittle behavior with
increase in waiting time, which may be caused by restricted relaxation modes
due to aging. In a force controlled mode, decrease in strain at failure at
higher age also suggested enhanced brittleness with increase in waiting time.
Remarkably, the constant force tensile deformation data up to the point of
failure showed experimental time- aging time superposition that gave an
independent estimation of relaxation time and elastic modulus dependence on
age.

studied extensively. It is known that any $n$-node static tree can be
represented in $2n + o(n)$ bits and a number of operations on the tree can be
supported in constant time under the word-RAM model. However the data
structures are complicated and difficult to dynamize. We propose a simple and
flexible data structure, called the range min-max tree, that reduces the large
number of relevant tree operations considered in the literature to a few
primitives that are carried out in constant time on sufficiently small trees.
The result is extended to trees of arbitrary size, achieving $2n + O(n
/\polylog(n))$ bits of space. The redundancy is significantly lower than any
previous proposal. Our data structure builds on the range min-max tree to
achieve $2n+O(n/\log n)$ bits of space and $O(\log n)$ time for all the
operations. We also propose an improved data structure using $2n+O(n\log\log
n/\log n)$ bits and improving the time to the optimal $O(\log n/\log \log n)$
for most operations. Furthermore, we support sophisticated operations that
allow attaching and detaching whole subtrees, in time $\Order(\log^{1+\epsilon}
n / \log\log n)$. Our techniques are of independent interest. One allows
representing dynamic bitmaps and sequences supporting rank/select and indels,
within zero-order entropy bounds and optimal time $O(\log n / \log\log n)$ for
all operations on bitmaps and polylog-sized alphabets, and $O(\log n \log
\sigma / (\log\log n)^2)$ on larger alphabet sizes $\sigma$. This improves upon
the best existing bounds for entropy-bounded storage of dynamic sequences,
compressed full-text self-indexes, and compressed-space construction of the
Burrows-Wheeler transform.

Comparing the experimental findings to the numeric analysis of the full
thermo-mechanical problem, these materials emerge as model systems to
investigate both the mechanical and thermal energy transfer at the nanoscale.

significantly deviate from the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, where the
equation of state (EOS) $w$ and the energy density $\rho_{\Lambda}$ of DE will
rapidly decrease along with the increase of redshift $z$. Inspired by this
clue, we separate the redshifts into different bins, and discuss the models of
a constant $w$ or a constant $\rho_{\Lambda}$ in each bin, respectively. It is
found that for fitting the Constitution set alone, $w$ and $\rho_{\Lambda}$
will also rapidly decrease along with the increase of $z$, which is consistent
with the result of CPL model. Moreover, a step function model in which
$\rho_{\Lambda}$ rapidly decreases at redshift $z\sim0.331$ presents a
significant improvement ($\Delta \chi^{2}=-4.361$) over the CPL
parameterization, and performs better than other DE models. We also plot the
error bars of DE density of this model, and find that this model deviates from
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ at 68.3% confidence level (CL); this may
arise from some biasing systematic errors in the handling of SNIa data, or more
interestingly from the nature of DE itself. In addition, for models with same
number of redshift bins, a piecewise constant $\rho_{\Lambda}$ model always
performs better than a piecewise constant $w$ model; this shows the advantage
of using $\rho_{\Lambda}$, instead of $w$, to probe the variation of DE.

control, the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system,
has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum
systems, called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems, from basic
quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way. The synthesis
theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of
linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for
applications beyond the realization of coherent feedback controllers. In
earlier work, Nurdin, James and Doherty have established that an arbitrary
linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of
simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators, together with a
direct interaction Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of
the oscillators. However, from an experimental perspective and based on current
methods and technologies, direct interaction Hamiltonians are challenging to
implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom. In order to
facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems, this paper
develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that
relies solely on field-mediated interactions, including in implementation of
the direct interaction Hamiltonian. Explicit synthesis examples are provided to
illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic
systems using the new algorithm.

E.Korobkina et al., PRB 70,035409) results of measurement of temperature
dependence of losses of ultracold neutrons (UCN) in a range from 4 K to 300 K
at UCN storage in a copper trap are presented. At interpretation of
experimental data it was artificially considered only the difference of losses
rate 1/tau(T)= 1/tau_exp(T)- 1/tau_exp(10K), (tau - UCN storage time in the
trap). It has been accepted for temperature dependence of losses which changes
from 0 to 3.3*10-4 per one collision of UCN with a trap surface. However, the
analysis of raw experimental data shows that in a trap at temperature 10 K
there is losses 1.0*10-3 per collision. They are considerably (in 3 times) more
than discussed temperature dependence and almost 10 times more than losses due
to capture cross section on copper. It is the most probable that these losses
are connected with leakage of UCN through a slit of trap shutter. Change of the
size of a slits on 25% at change of temperature from 300K to 10K can quite
explain discussed temperature dependence. Certainly, hydrogen is present on a
surface, but as it was shown at work [2] (V.P.Alfimenkov et al., JETP., Vol.
55, No. 2 25 Jan.1992) temperature dependence in 3 times lower, even on the
undegased surfaces than on the degassed and deuterated surface in work [1]. At
last, deuteration of a trap surface allows almost completely to suppress
temperature dependence connected with presence of hydrogen [2]. The conclusion
of work [1] is that hydrogen is localized on a surface in the form of a film,
instead of distribution in the surface substance. This conclusion contradicts
results of measurement of energy dependence of UCN losses in work [2]. More
detailed analysis of work [1] and works [2] is presented below.

flooding the soil specimen in an oedometer under its in-situ overburden stress.
On the other hand, in order to assess the swell induced by the excavation
undertaken during the construction of the railway, a second method was applied.
The soil was first loaded to its in situ overburden stress existing before the
excavation. It was then flooded and unloaded to its current overburden stress
(after the excavation). The swell induced by this unloading was considered.
Finally, the experimental results obtained were analyzed, together with the
results from other laboratory tests performed previously and the data collected

estimated which corresponds to the difference between the monitored heave and

potential wells. The transition kinetics is asymptotically
stretched-exponential when the potential barrier $V_0$ several times exceeds
thermal energy $k_BT$ ($V_0\sim 2 - 10 k_BT$) and it cannot be described by the
non-Markovian rate theory (NMRT). The well-known NMRT result approximates,
however, ever better with the increasing barrier height, the most probable
logarithm of the residence times. Moreover, the rate description is gradually
restored when the barrier height exceeds a fuzzy borderline which depends on
the power law exponent of free subdiffusion $\alpha$. Such a potential-free
subdiffusion is ergodic. Surprisingly, in periodic potentials it is not
sensitive to the barrier height in the long time asymptotic limit. However, the
transient to this asymptotic regime is extremally slow and it does profoundly
depend on the barrier height. The time-scale of such subdiffusion can exceed
the mean residence time in a potential well, or in a finite spatial domain by
many orders of magnitude. All these features are in sharp contrast with an
alternative subdiffusion mechanism involving jumps among traps with the

electronic transport through single molecules or molecular wires. To assess its
influence on the conductance is computationally demanding, because a large
number of conformations must be considered. Here we analyze an approximate
recursive layer Green function approach for the ballistic transport through
quasi one-dimensional nano-junctions. We find a rapid convergence of the method
with its control parameter, the layer thickness, and good agreement with
existing experimental and theoretical data. Because the computational effort
rises only linearly with system size, this method permits treatment of very
large systems. We investigate the conductance of gold- and silver wires of
different sizes and conformations. For weak electrode disorder and imperfect
coupling between electrode and wire we find conductance variations of
approximately 20%. Overall we find the conductance of silver junctions well
described by the immediate vicinity of narrowest point in the junction, a
result that may explain the observation of well-conserved conductance plateaus
in recent experiments on silver junctions. In an application to flexible
oligophene wires, we find that strongly distorted conformations that are
sterically forbidden at zero temperature, contribute significantly to the
observed average zero-bias conductance of the molecular wire.

Recently, Fauve & P\'etr\'elis [""Peyresq lectures on nonlinear phenomena"", ed.

reach the dynamo threshold in a dynamo experiment increases with the scale
separation in the limit of large scale separation. With a more elaborate method
based on subharmonic solutions [F. Plunian and K.-H. R\""adler, Geophys.
Astrophys. Fluid Dynamics 96, 115 (2002)], we show, for the Roberts flow, the
existence of an optimal scale separation for which this power is minimum.
Previous results obtained by Tilgner [Phys. Lett. A 226, 75 (1997)] with a
completely different numerical method are also reconsidered here. Again, we
find an optimal scale separation in terms of minimum power for dynamo action.
In addition we find that this scale separation compares very well with the one
derived from the subharmonic solutions method.

convective stars and those which have a radiative core. This result is
consistent with a scenario in which the magnetic field changes topology when
the star changes from being fully convective, to one containing a radiative
core. When the star is convective the magnetic field appears dominated by
large-scale structures, resulting in global-size spots that drive the observed
variability. For those stars with radiative cores we observe a marked absence
of variability due to spots, which suggests a switch to a magnetic field
dominated by smaller-scale structures, resulting in many smaller spots and thus
less apparent variability. This implies that wide field variability surveys may
only be sensitive to fully convective stars. On the one hand this reduces the
chances of picking out young groups (since the convective stars are the lower
mass and therefore fainter objects), but conversely the absolute magnitude of
the head of the convective sequence provides a straightforward measure of age

$\mathcal C$ of $C^\infty$-functions. We require that $\mathcal C$ includes
polynomial but excludes flat functions (quasianalyticity) and is closed under
composition, derivation, division by a coordinate, and taking the inverse.
Examples are quasianalytic Denjoy--Carleman classes, in particular, the class
of real analytic functions $C^\omega$.
  We show that there exists a locally finite covering $\{\pi_k\}$ of the
parameter space, where each $\pi_k$ is a composite of finitely many $\mathcal
C$-mappings each of which is either a local blow-up with smooth center or a
local power substitution (in coordinates given by $x \mapsto (\pm
x_1^{\gamma_1},...,\pm x_q^{\gamma_q})$, $\gamma_i \in \mathbb N_{>0}$), such
that, for each $k$, the family of polynomials $P {\o}\pi_k$ admits a $\mathcal

local blow-ups suffice.
  Using this desingularization result, we prove that the roots of $P$ can be
parameterized by $SBV_{loc}$-functions whose classical gradients exist almost
everywhere and belong to $L^1_{loc}$. In general the roots cannot have
gradients in $L^p_{loc}$ for any $1 < p \le \infty$. Neither can the roots be
in $W_{loc}^{1,1}$ or $VMO$.
  We obtain the same regularity properties for the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors of $\mathcal C$-families of normal matrices. A further consequence
is that every continuous subanalytic function belongs to $SBV_{loc}$.

numerical simulations of barred galaxies and polarization maps. The main result
is that the modeled magnetic field configurations resemble maps of the
polarized intensity observed in barred galaxies. They exhibit polarization
vectors along the bar and arms forming coherent structures similar to the

discrepancy between the velocity and magnetic field configurations in this type

that travel outwards. Each gaseous spiral arm is accompanied by a magnetic
counterpart, which separates and survives in the inter-arm region. Because of a
strong compression, shear of non-axisymmetric bar flows and differential
rotation, the total energy of modeled magnetic field grows constantly, while

supernovae (SNe Ia) and their detonation is a vital discriminant between the
various progenitor scenarios that have been proposed for them. We use SDSS
optical and GALEX ultraviolet observations of the early-type host galaxies of
21 nearby SNe Ia and quantify the presence or absence of any young stellar
population to constrain the minimum time delay for each supernova. We find that
early-type host galaxies lack `prompt' SNe Ia with time delays of <100 Myr and
that ~70% SNe Ia have minimum time delays of 275 Myr -- 1.25 Gyr, with a median
of 650 Myr, while at least 20% SNe Ia have minimum time delays of at least 1
Gyr at 95% confidence and two of these four SNe Ia are are likely older than 2
Gyr. The distribution of minimum time delays observed matches most closely the
expectation for the single-degenerate channel with a main sequence donor.
Furthermore, we do not find any evidence that sub-luminous SNe Ia are
associated with long time delays.

field in the framework of a non local Nambu-Jona Lasinio model with the
Polyakov loop. We use the Lattice results on the deconfinement temperature of
the pure gauge theory to compute the same quantity in the presence of dynamical
quarks. We find a linear relationship between the deconfinement temperature
with quarks and the squared root of the applied field strength, $gH$, in
qualitative (and to some extent also quantitative) agreement with existing
Lattice calculations. On the other hand, we find a discrepancy on the
approximate chiral symmetry restoration: while Lattice results suggest the
deconfinement and the chiral restoration remain linked even at non-zero value
of $gH$, our results are consistent with a scenario in which the two
transitions are separated as $gH$ is increased.

InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs) are on average divergent from analogous

data of L_IR>10^10 L_solar, 70um-selected objects in the 0.1<z<2 redshift range
and supported by a comparison with the IRAS Bright Galaxy Sample. The majority
of the objects in our sample are described by Spectral Energy Distributions
(SEDs) which peak at longer wavelengths than local sources of equivalent total
infrared luminosity. This shift in SED peak wavelength implies a noticeable
change in the dust and/or star-forming properties from z~0 to the early
Universe, tending towards lower dust temperatures, indicative of strong
evolution in the cold dust, `cirrus', component. We show that these objects are
potentially the missing link between the well-studied local IR-luminous
galaxies, Spitzer IR populations and SCUBA sources -- the z<1 counterparts of
the cold z>1 SubMillimetre Galaxies (SMGs) discovered in blank-field
submillimetre surveys. The Herschel Space Observatory is well placed to fully
characterise the nature of these objects, as its coverage extends over a major
part of the far-IR/submm SED for a wide redshift range.

nonclassical transmitted states over classical ones is considered. Attention is
focused on the situation where system loss is significant and additive Gaussian
noise may be present at the receiver. Under the assumption that the total
received state is classical, rigorous output density operator representations
and their trace distance bounds are developed for classical and nonclassical
transmitted states. For applications with high loss in all modes, a practical
No-Go theorem is enunciated that rules out the possibility of significant
advantage of nonclassical over classical states. The recent work on quantum
illumination is discussed as an example of our no-go approach.

braneworld model, by solving the full non-linear equations of motion for the
scalar degree of freedom in this model, the brane bending mode. While coupling
universally to matter, the brane-bending mode has self-interactions that become
important as soon as the density field becomes non-linear. These
self-interactions lead to a suppression of the field in high-density
environments, and restore gravity to General Relativity. The code uses a
multi-grid relaxation scheme to solve the non-linear field equation in the
quasi-static approximation. We perform simulations of a flat self-accelerating
DGP model without cosmological constant. The results of the DGP simulations are
compared with standard gravity simulations assuming the same expansion history,
and with DGP simulations using the linearized equation for the brane bending
mode. This allows us to isolate the effects of the non-linear self-couplings of
the field which are noticeable already on quasi-linear scales. We present
results on the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function, and discuss
the behavior of the brane bending mode within cosmological structure formation.
We find that, independently of CMB constraints, the self-accelerating DGP model
is strongly constrained by current weak lensing and cluster abundance
measurements.
