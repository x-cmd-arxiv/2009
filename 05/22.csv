Lyr (RRab) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to investigate the
structure of its stellar halo. We apply conservative cuts in period, amplitude
and magnitude to remove blends and other contamination. We use
period--luminosity and period--color relations to determine distance and
extinction of every star in our final sample of 9393 stars. In order to
determine the scatter of our method, we compare the distributions of distances
in two regions at the edges of the covered area with a central region. We
determine the intrinsic line-of-sight dispersion in the center to be 0.135 mag
or 3.21 kpc (FWHM of 0.318 mag or 7.56 kpc), assuming zero depth in one of the
edge regions. The conservative cuts we apply reduce the derived depth
significantly. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of RRab stars is
deformed in the sense that stars on the Eastern side are closer than on the
Western side. We model the RRab distribution as a triaxial ellipsoid and
determine its axes ratios to be 1:2.00:3.50 with the longest axis inclined by 6
degrees from the line of sight. Another result of our analysis is an extinction
map of the LMC and a map of internal reddening, which we make publicly
available.

Phi with an arbitrary potential V(Phi). The model contains two coupled scalar

branes on X3 in this background become N M2 branes on X4. This provides a
string theory derivation for the recently conjectured description of the M2

synchronization (RBS), and other methods of estimating clock values, can be
incorporated in standard clock synchronization algorithms to improve
synchronization quality. We advocate a logical separation of the task of
estimating the clock values of other nodes in the network from the task of
using these estimates to output a logical clock value.
  The separation is achieved by means of a virtual estimate graph, overlaid on
top of the real network graph, which represents the information various nodes
can obtain about each other. RBS estimates are represented in the estimate
graph as edges between nodes at distance 2 from each other in the original
network graph. A clock synchronization algorithm then operates on the estimate
graph as though it were the original network.
  To illustrate the merits of this approach, we modify a recent optimal
gradient clock synchronization algorithm to work in this setting. The modified
algorithm transparently takes advantage of RBS estimates and any other means by
which nodes can estimate each others' clock values.

discussed. Selected isomorph predictions are validated by computer simulations

correlating liquid. The final section of the paper relates the isomorph concept
to phenomenological melting rules, Rosenfeld's excess entropy scaling, Young

Asymptotic
expressions have been derived for many of these sum rules in the limit of long
orbital period (or large action). Although sum rule convergence may well be
exponentially rapid for chaotic systems in a global sense with time, individual
contributions to the sums may fluctuate with a width which diverges in time.
Our interest is in the global convergence of sum rules as well as their local
fluctuations. It turns out that a simple version of a lazy baker map gives an
ideal system in which classical sum rules, their corrections, and their
fluctuations can be worked out analytically. This is worked out in detail for
the Hannay-Ozorio sum rule. In this particular case the rate of convergence of
the sum rule is found to be governed by the Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, and
both local and global boundaries for which the sum rule may converge are given.
In addition, the width of the fluctuations is considered and worked out
analytically, and it is shown to have an interesting dependence on the location
of the region over which the sum rule is applied. It is also found that as the
region of application is decreased in size the fluctuations grow. This suggests
a way of controlling the length scale of the fluctuations by considering a time
dependent phase space volume, which for the lazy baker map decreases
exponentially rapidly with time.

temperature and binary orbital parameters. A 2-dimensional hydrodynamical model
is used to study the stability of mass transfer in wind accreting symbiotic
binary systems. In our simulations we use an adiabatic equation of state and a
modified version of the isothermal approximation, where the temperature depends
on the distance from the mass losing star and its companion. We explore the
accretion flow between the components and formation of accretion disks for a
range of orbital separations and wind parameters. Our results show the
formation of stream flow between the stars and accretion disks of various sizes
for certain orbital configurations. For a typical slow and massive wind from an
AGB star the flow pattern is similar to a RLOF with accretion rates of 10% of
the mass loss from the primary. Stable disks with exponentially decreasing
density profiles and masses of the order $10^{-4}$ solar masses are formed when
wind acceleration occurs at several stellar radii. The formation of tidal
streams and accretion disks is found to be weakly dependent on the mass loss
from the AGB star. Our simulations of gravitationally focused wind accretion in
symbiotic binaries show the formation of stream flows and enhanced accretion
rates onto the compact component.

cosmologists. As observational cosmology forges ahead, theorists have struggled
to make sense of a standard model that requires extreme fine tuning. This
challenge is known as the cosmological constant problem. The theory of
gravitational aether is an alternative to general relativity that does not
suffer from this fine-tuning problem, as it decouples the quantum field theory
vacuum from geometry, while remaining consistent with other tests of gravity.
In this paper, we study static black hole solutions in this theory and show
that it manifests a UV-IR coupling: Aether couples the spacetime metric close
to the black hole horizon, to metric at infinity. We then show that using the
Trans-Planckian ansatz (as a quantum gravity effect) close to the black hole
horizon, leads to an accelerating cosmological solution, far from the horizon.
Interestingly, this acceleration matches current observations for stellar mass
black holes. Based on our current understanding of the black hole accretion
history in the Universe, we then make a prediction for how the effective dark

with the Very Large Array radio telescope, and X-ray features revealed by
Chandra, to probe the non-thermal and thermal components of the ICM, their
relations and interactions. Results. The cluster shows highly complex radio
emission. A bright, giant radio halo is detected at frequencies as high as 4.8
GHz. MACS J0717.5+3745 is the most distant cluster currently known to host a
radio halo. This radio halo is also the most powerful ever observed, and the
second case for which polarized radio emission has been detected, indicating
that the magnetic field is ordered on large scales.

galaxy disks are largely dictated by the mass, concentration, and spin of their
surrounding dark matter haloes. Equally important, however, are the fraction of
baryons in the halo that collect into the central galaxy, as well as the net
angular momentum that they are able to retain during its assembly process. We
explore the latter using a set of four large cosmological N-body/gasdynamical
simulations drawn from the OWLS (OverWhelmingly Large Simulations) project.
These runs differ only in their implementation of feedback from supernovae. We
find that, when expressed as fractions of their virial values, galaxy mass and
net angular momentum are tightly correlated. Galaxy mass fractions,
m_d=M_gal/M_vir, depend strongly on feedback, but only weakly on halo mass or
spin over the halo mass range explored here (M_vir>1e11 h^{-1}M_sun). The
angular momentum of a galaxy, j_d=J_gal/J_vir, correlates with m_d in a manner
that is insensitive to feedback and that deviates strongly from the simple j_d
= m_d assumption often adopted in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The
m_d-j_d correlation implies that, in a given halo, galaxy disk size is maximal
when the central galaxy makes up a substantial fraction (~20%-30%) of all
baryons within the virial radius. At z=2, such systems may host gaseous disks
with radial scale lengths as large as those reported for star-forming disks by
the SINS survey, even in moderately massive haloes of average spin. Extended
disks at z=2 may thus signal the presence of systems where galaxy formation has
been particularly efficient, rather than the existence of haloes with unusually
high spin parameter.

ratio between the angular momentum of a galaxy and that of its surrounding halo
(j_d=J_gal/J_vir) correlates closely with the galaxy mass (expressed in units

substantially from the m_d=j_d assumption commonly adopted in semianalytic

described by a logarithmic spiral, from which we interpret that the
gravitational potential is weakly perturbed by a two-arm spiral density wave

two-arm spiral distortion in the surface brightness, as hinted by the dust
structures in central images of NGC1097, and predicts a combined one-arm and
three-arm spiral structure in the velocity field, as revealed in the
non-circular motions of the ionised gas within the circumnuclear region of this

fraction of the measured non-circular motions that is due to radial inflow. We
combine the resulting inflow velocity with the gas density in the spiral arms,
inferred from emission line ratios, to estimate the mass inflow rate as a
function of radius, which reaches about 0.011 Msun/yr at a distance of 70 pc

the Eddington mass accretion rate onto the central black hole in this

provide a cleaner view of nuclear spirals than the associated dust, but that

semi-analytical model for anisotropic AGN outflows which expand away along the

numerical simulation algorithm for simulating the growth of large-scale
structure in the universe. Using this modified algorithm, we perform a series
of 9 simulations inside cosmological volumes of size $(128 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$,
in a concordance $\Lambda$CDM universe, varying the opening angle of the
outflows, the lifetimes of the AGNs, their kinetic fractions, and their level
of clustering. For each simulation, we compute the volume fraction of the IGM
enriched in metals by the outflows. The resulting enriched volume fractions are
relatively small at $z \gtrsim 2.5$, and then grow rapidly afterward up to $z =
0$. We find that AGN outflows enrich from 65% to 100% of the entire universe at
the present epoch, for different values of the model parameters. The enriched
volume fraction depends weakly on the opening angle of the outflows. However,
increasingly anisotropic outflows preferentially enrich underdense regions, a
trend found more prominent at higher redshifts and decreasing at lower

be regarded as a particular case of the most general relativistic force field.
In particular, at first it is shown that the structure of the Lorentz force
comes directly from the structure of the three-force transformation law, and
that E and B fields can be defined, which in general will depend not only on
the space-time coordinate, but also on the velocity of the body acted upon.
Then it is proved that these fields become independent from the body velocity
if the force field propagates throughout space at the relativistic speed limit
c. Finally, field sources are introduced by defining them as perturbations of
the field itself, obtaining a generalization of Maxwell equations which allow
to express the field in terms sources, if these last are known a priori.
Electrodynamics follows simply assuming, in addition to the postulate of field
propagation at the speed c, that scalar sources of the B field are missing and
that electric charge is an invariant characteristic of matter, acting both as
source of the field and sensing property. The presented approach may have
valuable didactic effectiveness in showing that space-time structure, as
defined by Special Relativity postulates, is the ultimate responsible of the
structure of electrodynamics laws.

resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit, the first of which
was reported by Bate, Bonnell and Bromm. The initial conditions of the two
calculations are identical, but in the new simulation the power spectrum of the
velocity field imposed on the cloud initially and allowed to decay is biased in
favour of large-scale motions. Whereas the calculation of Bate et al. began
with a power spectrum P(k) ~ k^{-4} to match the Larson scaling relations for
the turbulent motions observed in molecular clouds, the new calculation begins
with a power spectrum P(k) ~ k^{-6}. Despite this change to the initial motions
in the cloud and the resulting density structure of the molecular cloud, the
resulting stellar properties resulting from the two calculations are
indistinguishable. This demonstrates that the results of such hydrodynamical
calculations of star cluster formation are relatively insensitive to the
initial conditions. It is also consistent with the fact that the statistical
properties of stars and brown dwarfs (e.g. the stellar initial mass function)
are observed to be relatively invariant within our Galaxy and do not appear to

fewer errors than a naive prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468

constraint method. Ultimately, the quantum BRST structures are formulated in a
C*-algebraic context, leading to comparison of the quantum BRST and the Dirac
constraint method in a mathematically consistent framework. Comparisons of
rigorous models leads to the following three consequences: The quantum BRST
method and quantum Dirac method of constraints are not equivalent in general;
The BRST method does not remove the ghosts in the BRST physical algebra in
general. Extra selection criteria are required to select the correct physical
space, which do not guarantee correspondence between the Dirac and BRST
physical algebras; Conversely, the BRST physical algebra and Dirac physical
algebra coincide for a C*-algebraic model of QEM. This is a rigorous example of
Lagrangian BRST, implying quantum Lagrangian and quantum Hamiltonian BRST are
not equivalent constraint methods.

into non-overlapping protecting domains each containing only one or two
particles, the algorithm factorizes the N-body problem of collisions among
multiple Brownian particles into a set of much simpler single-body and two-body
problems. Efficient propagation of particles inside their protective domains is
enabled through the use of time-dependent Green's functions (propagators)
obtained as solutions for the first-passage statistics of random walks. The
resulting Monte Carlo algorithm is event-driven and asynchronous; each Brownian
particle propagates inside its own protective domain and on its own time clock.
The algorithm reproduces the statistics of the underlying Monte-Carlo model
exactly. Extensive numerical examples demonstrate that for an important class
of diffusion-reaction models the new algorithm is efficient at low particle
densities, where other existing algorithms slow down severely.

conditions, are confining at high temperature for sufficiently light fermion
mass $m$. In the high temperature confining region, the one-loop effective
potential for Polyakov loops has a Z(N)-symmetric confining minimum. String
tensions associated with Polyakov loops are calculable in perturbation theory,
and display a novel scaling behavior in which higher representations have
smaller string tensions than the fundamental representation. In the magnetic
sector, the Polyakov loop plays a role similar to a Higgs field, leading to an
apparent breaking of SU(N) to $U(1)^{N-1}$. This is turn yields a dual
effective theory where magnetic monopoles give rise to string tensions for
spatial Wilson loops. The spatial string tensions are calculable
semiclassically from kink solutions of the dual system. We show that the
spatial string tensions $\sigma^{(s)}_k$ associated with each $N$-ality $k$
obey a variant of Casimir scaling $\sigma^{(s)}_k /\sigma^{(s)}_1 \leq
\sqrt{k(N-k)/(N-1)} $. Although lattice simulations indicate that the high
temperature confining region is smoothly connected to the confining region of
low-temperature pure SU(N) gauge theory, the electric and magnetic string
tension scaling laws are different and readily distinguishable.

the interface of the heterostructure is similar to the state of the bulk
compound $\rm{(R,A)MO}$ at electronic density close to 0.5. Depending on the
bandwidth it will be a charge and orbital ordered CE state or an A-AF state
with $x^2-y^2$ orbital order. Our results can explain some properties of
long-period superlattices. As another interesting result, we find exotic
intermediate states stabilized in between the interface and the bulk-like
regimes of the heterostructure. For instance, a spin ""canted CE"" state and
others. They may not have an analog in experimentally known bulk phase
diagrams, but provide a natural interpolation between magnetically-ordered
states that are stable in the bulk at different electronic densities.

depend on the path length of scattering partons in the medium, and therefore is

can be reproduced to within the estimated uncertainty in the pre-launch

the quiet coronal DEM distribution can be recovered on size scales down to the
spatial resolution of the instrument (1$""$ pixels). The subset will therefore
be useful for studies of small-scale spatial inhomogeneities in the coronal
temperature structure, for example, in addition to studies requiring multiple
DEM derivations in space or time. We apply the subset to 45 quiet Sun datasets

the quiet Sun DEM is mainly a function of the radiating and conducting
properties of the plasma and is fairly insensitive to the location and rate of

a functor from formal loops to Sabinin algebras. We compare this functor to
that of Mikheev and Sabinin and show that although the brackets given by both

translates into associativity in algebras, other loop identities (such as the
Moufang identity) produce new algebra identities. Finally, we define a class of

clathrate Ba$_8$Ga$_{16}$Ge$_{30}$ by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The
conductivity spectra with the lowest-lying peaks at 1.15 and 1.80 THz are
identified with so-called rattling phonons, i.e., optical modes of the guest
ion Ba$^{2+}(2)$ with $T_{1u}$ symmetry in the oversized tetrakaidecahedral
cage. The temperature dependence of the spectra from these modes are totally
consistent with calculations based on a one-dimensional anharmonic potential
model that, with decreasing temperature, the shape becomes asymmetrically sharp
associated with a softening for the weight to shift to lower frequency. These
temperature dependences are determined, without any interaction effects, by the
Bose-factor for optical excitations of anharmonic phonons with the nonequally
spaced energy levels.

"0905.3611","Michael Livshits","Michael Livshits","You could simplify calculus","9 pages",,,,"math.HO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I explain a direct approach to differentiation and integration. Instead of
relying on the general notions of real numbers, limits and continuity, we treat
functions as the primary objects of our theory, and view differentiation as
division of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in a certain class of functions. When f is a
polynomial the division can be carried out explicitly. To see why a polynomial
with a positive derivative is increasing (the monotonicity theorem), we use the
estimate |f(x)-f(a)-f'(a)(x-a)|<=K(x-a)^2. By making it into a definition we
arrive at the notion of uniform Lipschitz differentiability (ULD), and see that
the derivative of a ULD function is Lipschitz. Taking different moduli of
continuity instead of |.|, we get different flavors of calculus, each rather
elementary, but all together covering the total range of continuously
differentiable functions. Using functions continuous at a, we recapture the
classical definition of differentiability at a point. We also see that ULD is
equivalent to divisibility of f(x)-f(a) by x-a in the class of Lipschitz
functions of two variables, x and a. The analogous fact is true for any
subadditive modulus of continuity. In this bottom-up, computational, one
modulus of continuity at a time approach, the monotonicity theorem takes the
central stage and provides the aspects of the subject important for practical
applications. The weighty ontological issues of compactness and completeness
can be treated lightly or postponed, since they are hardly used in this
streamlined approach that pretty much follows the Vladimir Arnold's ""principle
of minimal generality, according to which every idea should first be understood
in the simplest situation; only then can the method developed be applied to
more complicated cases."" I discuss a generalization to many variables briefly.

we show that, box-counting dimension in face of finite resolution of space-time

qualitative and the quantitative features of this effect can be understood. In
this way we derive a simple analytic expression of space-time dimension
running, which implies the modification of Newton's inverse square law in a
perfect agreement with the modification coming from one-loop gravitational

more photometric regions, new features and more accurate data around globular
cluster Palomar 5. A new method, Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), is
used to estimate the probability of cluster member to detect its tidal tails.
Cluster and field stars, used for training the networks, are extracted over a
$40\times20$ deg$^2$ field by color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The best BPNNs
with two hidden layers and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) training algorithm are
determined by the chosen cluster and field samples. The membership
probabilities of stars in the whole field are obtained with the BPNNs, and
contour maps of the probability distribution show that a tail extends $5.42\dg$
to the north of the cluster and a tail extends $3.77\dg$ to the south. The
whole tails are similar to those detected by \citet{od03}, but no longer debris
of the cluster is found to the northeast of the sky. The radial density
profiles are investigated both along the tails and near the cluster center.
Quite a few substructures are discovered in the tails. The number density
profile of the cluster is fitted with the King model and the tidal radius is
determined as $14.28'$. However, the King model cannot fit the observed profile
at the outer regions ($R > 8'$) because of the tidal tails generated by the
tidal force. Luminosity functions of the cluster and the tidal tails are
calculated, which confirm that the tails originate from Palomar 5.

particular class of BPS terms in the low energy effective supergravity action.
Specifically they compute the coupling F^2(\lambda\lambda)^{g-2}(d\phi)^2 where
F, \lambda and \phi are gauge field strengths, gaugino and holomorphic vector
multiplet scalars. The novel feature of these terms is that they depend both on
the vector and hypermultiplet moduli. The BPS nature of these terms implies
that they satisfy a holomorphicity condition with respect to vector moduli and
a harmonicity condition as well as a second order differential equation with
respect to hypermultiplet moduli. We study these conditions explicitly in
heterotic string theory and show that they are indeed satisfied up to anomalous
boundary terms in the world-sheet moduli space. We also analyze the boundary
terms in the holomorphicity and harmonicity equations at a generic point in the
vector and hyper moduli space. In particular we show that the obstruction to
the holomorphicity arises from the one loop threshold correction to the gauge
couplings and we argue that this is due to the contribution of non-holomorphic
couplings to the connected graphs via elimination of the auxiliary fields.

a higher CO[1-0] luminosity than that of CO[2-1]. Contrary to what is observed
in submillimeter galaxies and QSOs, in which the CO transitions are thermally
excited up to J>=3, these galaxies have low-excitation molecular gas, similar
to that in the Milky Way and local spirals. This is the first time that such

analysis suggests that molecular clouds with density and kinetic temperature
comparable to local spirals can reproduce our observations. The similarity in
the CO excitation properties suggests that a high, Milky-Way-like, CO to H_2

low-excitation properties are representative of ordinary galaxies at high

GHz and we studied the variations of the radio spectral index within the disks
of these spiral galaxies. We also compared the spectral index distribution and
the IR distribution, using 70 $\mu$m Spitzer observations. We found that in
these galaxies the non-thermal spectral index is anticorrelated with the radio
brightness. Bright regions, like the bar in NGC 3627 or the circumnuclear
region in NGC 7331, are characterized by a flatter spectrum with respect to the
underlying disk. Therefore, a systematic steepening of the spectral index with
the increasing distance from the center of these galaxies is observed.
Furthermore, by comparing the radio images with the 70 $\mu$m images of the
Spitzer satellite we found that a similar anticorrelation exists between the
radio spectral index and the infrared brightness, as expected on the basis of
the local correlation between the radio continuum and the infrared emission.
Our results support the idea that in regions of intense star formation the
electron diffusion must be efficient. The observed anticorrelation between
radio brightness and spectral index, may imply that the cosmic ray density and
the magnetic field strength are significantly higher in these regions than in
their surroundings.

merging cluster, located at a redshift of 0.55. Here we present Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) radio observations at 610 MHz of this cluster. The main
aim of the observations is to search for diffuse radio emission within the
galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 related to the ongoing merger. These GMRT
observations are complemented by Very Large Array (VLA) archival observations
at 1.4, 4.9 and 8.5 GHz. We have discovered a radio halo in the cluster MACS
J0717.5+3745 with a size of about 1.2 Mpc. The radio power P_1.4 GHz is 5 x
10^25 W/Hz, which makes it the most powerful radio halo known till date. A 700
kpc radio structure, which we classify as a radio relic, is located in between
the merging substructures of the system. The location of this relic roughly
coincides with regions of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) that have a
significant enhancement in temperature as shown by Chandra. The major axis of
the relic is also roughly perpendicular to the merger axis. This shows that the
relic might be the result of a merger-related shock wave, where particles are
accelerated via the diffuse shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism. Alternatively,
the relic might trace an accretion shock of a large-scale galaxy filament to
the south-west. The global spectral index of radio emission within the cluster
is found to be -1.24 +/-0.05 between 4.9 GHz and 610 MHz. We derive a value of
5.8 microGauss for the equipartition magnetic field strength at the location of
the radio halo. [abridged].

reliable representation of the relative reddening between sightlines than the

sensitive to fluctuations in the local ionization conditions. The behaviour of
the DIBs is consistent with the lambda5780 band being stronger than the

that there exists a non-zero cosmological constant, which implies in a deSitter

independent curvature standard in Riemann's geometry, leading eventually to the
cosmological constant problem in general relativity.
  We show how the curvature standard in Riemann's geometry can be fixed by
Nash's theorem on locally embedded Riemannian geometries, which imply in the
existence of extra dimensions. The resulting gravitational theory is more
general than general relativity, similar to brane-world gravity, but where the
propagation of the gravitational field along the extra dimensions is a
mathematical necessity, rather than being a a postulate. After a brief
introduction to Nash's theorem, we show that the vacuum energy density must
remain confined to four-dimensional space-times, but the cosmological constant
resulting from the contracted Bianchi identity is a gravitational contribution
which propagates in the extra dimensions. Therefore, the comparison between the
vacuum energy and the cosmological constant in general relativity ceases to be.
Instead, the geometrical fix provided by Nash's theorem suggests that the
vacuum energy density contributes to the perturbations of the gravitational
field.

scattering off charged particles. This effect may lead to important
consequences for the dynamics and the neutrino signal of the core-collapse
supernova. It is known that if neutrino is a Dirac fermion, then nu_L->nu_R
transition induced by the chirality flip leads to the emission of sterile
right-handed neutrinos. The typical energies of these neutrinos are rather
high, E ~ (100-200)MeV. Neutrino spin precession in the magnetic field either
inside the collapsing star or in the interstellar space may lead to the
backward transition, nu_R->nu_L. Both possibilities are known to be
interesting. In the former case high-energy neutrinos can deliver additional
energy to the supernova envelope, which can help the supernova to explode. In
the latter case high-energy neutrinos may be detected simultaneously with the
""normal"" supernova neutrino signal, which would be a smoking gun for the Dirac
neutrino magnetic moment. We report the results of the calculation of the
supernova right-handed neutrino luminosity up to 250 ms after bounce. They
allow to refine the estimates of the energy emitted in right-handed neutrinos.
Also the sensitivity of water Cherenkov detectors to the Dirac neutrino
magnetic moment is estimated. For mu_Dirac=10^{-13}mu_B Super-Kamiokande is
expected to detect at least few high-energy events from a galactic supernova
explosion.
  Also we briefly discuss the case of Majorana neutrino magnetic moment. It is
pointed out that spin flips may quickly equilibrate electron neutrinos with
non-electron antineutrinos if mu_Majorana~10^{-12}mu_B. This may lead to
various consequences for supernova physics.

bistability: for a large range of values the realization of snowball (SB) or of

results on the global climate thermodynamics, we show that that the two regimes
feature radically different properties. The efficiency of the climate machine
increases with decreasing solar constant in W climate conditions, whereas the
opposite takes place in the SB regime. Instead, entropy production is
increasing with the solar constant in both branches of climate conditions, and
its value is about 4 times as large in the W branch than in the corresponding C
state. Finally, the degree of irreversibility of the system is much higher in
the W conditions, with an explosive growth in the upper range of the considered
values of solar constants. Whereas in the SB regime a dominating role is played
by changes in the meridional albedo contrast, in the W climate regime changes
in the intensity of latent heat fluxes are crucial for determining the observed
properties. This substantiates the importance of addressing correctly the
variations of the hydrological cycle in a changing climate. An interpretation
of the transitions at the boundary of the bistable region based upon
macro-scale thermodynamic properties is also proposed. Our results support the

between living beings in biology, sociology, and economics, and quantifies the
outcomes by payoffs. The prisoner's dilemma (PD) describes situations in which
it is profitable if everybody cooperates rather than defects (free-rides or
cheats), but as cooperation is risky and defection is tempting, the expected
outcome is defection. Nevertheless, some biological and social mechanisms can
support cooperation by effectively transforming the payoffs. Here, we study the
related phase transitions, which can be of first order (discontinous) or of
second order (continuous), implying a variety of different routes to
cooperation. After classifying the transitions into cases of equilibrium
displacement, equilibrium selection, and equilibrium creation, we show that a
transition to cooperation may take place even if the stationary states and the
eigenvalues of the replicator equation for the PD stay unchanged. Our example
is based on adaptive group pressure, which makes the payoffs dependent on the
endogeneous dynamics in the population. The resulting bistability can invert
the expected outcome in favor of cooperation.

in brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance
determined mainly by Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat
conduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant
intracellular Na$^{+}$ build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with
pumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the
power dissipated by the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ pump depends biphasically on
frequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on
frequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature
diverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not
beneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a
sufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on
fiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is
strongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal
neurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude
smaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that
neuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe
regime. Analytical formulas presented can be used to estimate average firing

clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with ages ranging from 0.01 to
1.0 Gyr, to derive the clusters' stellar mass functions (MFs) at their
half-mass radii.
  Aims. The LMC is an ideal environment to study stellar MFs, because it
contains a large population of compact clusters at different evolutionary
stages. We aim to obtain constraints on the initial MFs (IMFs) of our sample
clusters on the basis of their present-day MFs, combined with our understanding
of their dynamical and photometric evolution.
  Methods. We derive the clusters' present-day MFs below 1.0 Msun using deep
observations with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and updated stellar
population synthesis models.
  Results. Since the relaxation timescales of low-mass stars are very long,
dynamical evolution will not have affected the MFs below 1.0 Msun
significantly, so that - within the uncertainties - the derived MFs are
consistent with the solar-neighbourhood IMF, at least for the younger clusters.
  Conclusions. The IMF in the low-density, low-metallicity environment of the
LMC disk is not significantly different from that in the solar neighbourhood.

A customer that arrives and sees $n$ others in the system ""balks"" (i.e.,

proportional to $n+1$, we obtain explicit expressions for a tagged customer's

conditioned on the number of other customers present when the tagged customer

a big amount of agents. Every agent has a vector of parameters which specifies
