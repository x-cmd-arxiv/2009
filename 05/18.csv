and the Lykken-Randall (LR) brane scenarios when brane-localized Standard Model
currents are coupled to a massive vector field living in the five-dimensional
warped background of the RS 2 model. By the AdS/CFT dictionary these
backgrounds exhibit certain properties of the unparticle CFT at large N_c and
strong 't Hooft coupling. Within the RS 2 model we also examine and contrast in
detail the scalar and vector position-space correlators at intermediate and
large distances. Unitarity of brane-to-brane scattering amplitudes is seen to
imply a necessary and sufficient condition on the positivity of the bulk mass,
which leads to the well-known unitarity bound on vector operators in a CFT.

in the use of telescopes. We define two regimes of use : a general-purpose (or
survey) one, where the telescope governs research, and a dedicated one, in
which the telescope is tailored to a specific project which includes a network
of other tools. This conceptual framework is first applied to the history of
the 80-cm telescope of Toulouse Observatory, which is initially anchored in a
general-purpose regime linked to astrometry. After a transition in the 1930s,
it is integrated in a dedicated regime centered on astrophysics. This evolution
is compared to that of a very similar instrument, the 80-cm telescope of
Marseille Observatory, which converts early on to the dedicated regime with the
Fabry-Perot interferometer around 1910, and, after a period of idleness, is
again used in the survey mode after WWII. To further validate our new concept,
we apply it to the telescopes of Washburn Observatory, of Dominion
Astrophysical Observatory and of Meudon Observatory. The uses of the different
telescopes illustrate various combinations of the two regimes, which can be
successive, simultaneous or alternating. This conceptual framework is likely to
be applicable to other fields of pure and applied science.

conducting a series of cosmic ray experiments under a magnetic field up to 4 T,
using a small prototype TPC with a replaceable readout device: multi-wire
proportional chamber (MWPC) or gas electron multiplier (GEM). We first
confirmed that the MWPC readout could not be a fall-back option of the ILC-TPC
under a strong axial magnetic field of 4 T since its spatial resolution
suffered severely from the so called E x B effect in the vicinity of the wire
planes. The GEM readout, on the other hand, was found to be virtually free from
the E x B effect as had been expected and gave the resolution determined by the
transverse diffusion of the drift electrons (diffusion limited). Furthermore,
GEMs allow a wider choice of gas mixtures than MWPCs. Among the gases we tried
so far a mixture of Ar-CF4-isobutane, in which MWPCs could be prone to
discharges, seems promising as the operating gas of the ILC-TPC because of its
small diffusion constant especially under a strong magnetic field. We report
the measured drift properties of this mixture including the diffusion constant
as a function of the electric field and compare them with the predictions of
Magboltz. Also presented is the spatial resolution of a GEM-based ILC-TPC
estimated from the measurement with the prototype.

measurements and filtergrams taken with the Hinode satellite and the Dutch Open

internetwork regions appears in the form of Omega-shaped loops. The emergence
rate is 0.02 loops per hour and arcsec^{-2}, which brings 1.1 x 10^12 Mx s^{-1}
arcsec^{-2} of new flux to the solar surface. Initially, the loops are observed
as small patches of linear polarization above a granular cell. Shortly
afterwards, two footpoints of opposite polarity become visible in circular
polarization within or at the edges of the granule and start to move toward the
adjacent intergranular space. The orientation of the footpoints does not seem
to obey Hale's polarity rules. The loops are continuously buffeted by
convective motions, but they always retain a high degree of coherence.
Interestingly, 23% of the loops that emerge in the photosphere reach the
chromosphere (16 cases out of 69). They are first detected in Fe I 630 nm
magnetograms and 5 minutes later in Mg I b 517.3 nm magnetograms. After about 8
minutes, some of them are also observed in Ca II H line-core images, where the
footpoints produce small brightness enhancements.

in the GOODS-S field up to z ~ 1 for luminosity- and mass-limited samples.
  Methods: We select disc-disc merger remnants on the basis of morphological
asymmetries, and address three main sources of systematic errors: (i) we
explicitly apply morphological K-corrections, (ii) we measure asymmetries in
galaxies artificially redshifted to z_d = 1.0 to deal with loss of
morphological information with redshift, and (iii) we take into account the
observational errors in z and A, which tend to overestimate the merger
fraction, though use of maximum likelihood techniques.
  Results: We obtain morphological merger fractions (f_m) below 0.06 up to z ~
1. Parameterizing the merger fraction evolution with redshift as f_m(z) =
f_m(0) (1+z)^m, we find that m = 1.8 +/- 0.5 for M_B <= -20 galaxies, while m =
5.4 +/- 0.4 for M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies. When we translate our merger
fractions to merger rates (R_m), their evolution, parameterized as R_m(z) =
R_m(0) (1+z)^n, is quite similar in both cases: n = 3.3 +/- 0.8 and n = 3.5 +/-
0.4, respectively.
  Conclusions: Our results imply that only ~8% of today's M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun
galaxies have undergone a disc-disc major merger since z ~ 1. In addition, ~21%
of this mass galaxies at z ~ 1 have undergone one of these mergers since z ~
1.5. This suggests that disc-disc major mergers are not the dominant process in
the evolution of M_star >= 10^10 M_Sun galaxies since z ~ 1, but may be an
important process at z > 1.

possible to choose them in such a manner that the total (open plus closed)
Dirac worldsheets explicitly decouple from the charged sector, leaving only the
effect of their associated gauge invariant borders (where the monopoles are
placed), without missing any information about the center vortex sector.

using high-fidelity numerical simulations. By starting from an initially
steady-state axisymmetric solution, we are able to follow the growth of this
overstability from small amplitudes. In the small-amplitude limit, before any
transient accretion disk is formed, the oscillation period of the accretion
shock is comparable to the Keplerian period at the Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion
radius (R_a), independent of the size of the accreting object. The growth rate
of the overstability increases dramatically with decreasing size of the
accretor, but is relatively insensitive to the upstream Mach number of the
flow. We confirm that the flip-flop does not require any gradient in the
upstream flow. Indeed, a small density gradient as used in the discovery
simulations has virtually no influence on the growth rate of the overstability.
The ratio of specific heats does influence the overstability, with smaller
gamma leading to faster growth of the instability. For a relatively large
accretor (a radius of 0.037R_a) planar accretion is unstable for gamma = 4/3,
but stable for gamma > 1.6. Planar accretion is unstable even for gamma = 5/3
provided the accretor has a radius of < 0.0025R_a. We also confirm that when
the accretor is sufficiently small, the secular evolution is described by
sudden jumps between states with counter-rotating quasi-Keplerian accretion
disks.

interest rate derivatives using multiple distinct yield curves for market
coherent estimation of discount factors and forward rates with different

  Within such double-curve-single-currency framework, adopted by the market
after the credit-crunch crisis started in summer 2007, standard single-curve
no-arbitrage relations are no longer valid, and can be recovered by taking
properly into account the forward basis bootstrapped from market basis swaps.
Numerical results show that the resulting forward basis curves may display a
richer micro-term structure that may induce appreciable effects on the price of
interest rate instruments.
  By recurring to the foreign-currency analogy we also derive generalised
no-arbitrage double-curve market-like formulas for basic plain vanilla interest
rate derivatives, FRAs, swaps, caps/floors and swaptions in particular. These
expressions include a quanto adjustment typical of cross-currency derivatives,
naturally originated by the change between the numeraires associated to the two
yield curves, that carries on a volatility and correlation dependence.
Numerical scenarios confirm that such correction can be non negligible, thus
making unadjusted double-curve prices, in principle, not arbitrage free.
  Both the forward basis and the quanto adjustment find a natural financial
explanation in terms of counterparty risk.

to MHz are produced by opening cracks, which can be considered as the so-called
precursors of general fracture. We emphasize that the MHz radiation appears
earlier than the kHz in both laboratory and geophysical scale. An important
challenge in this field of research is to distinguish characteristic epochs in
the evolution of precursory EM activity and identify them with the equivalent
last stages in the earthquake (EQ) preparation process. Recently, we proposed
the following two epochs/stages model: (i) The second epoch, which includes the
finally emerged strong impulsive kHz EM emission is due to the fracture of the
high strength large asperities that are distributed along the activated fault
sustaining the system. (ii) The first epoch, which includes the initially
emerged MHz EM radiation is thought to be due to the fracture of a highly
heterogeneous system that surrounds the family of asperities. A catastrophic EQ
of magnitude Mw = 6.3 occurred on 06/04/2009 in central Italy. The majority of
the damage occurred in the city of L'Aquila. Clear kHz - MHz EM anomalies have
been detected prior to the L'Aquila EQ. Herein, we investigate the seismogenic
origin of the detected MHz anomaly. The analysis in terms of intermittent
dynamics of critical fluctuations reveals that the candidate EM precursor: (i)
can be described in analogy with a thermal continuous phase transition; (ii)
has anti-persistent behaviour. These features suggest that the emerged
candidate precursor could be triggered by microfractures in the highly
disordered system that surrounded the backbone of asperities of the activated

galactocentric distance is expressed in terms of the isophotal radius R25. The
gradient corresponds to -0.077 dex/kpc, and agrees very well with the
galactocentric trend in metallicity obtained for 29 B and A supergiants in the
same galaxy. The intercept of the regression for the nebular data virtually
coincides with the intercept obtained from the stellar data. This allows little
room for depletion of nebular oxygen onto dust grains, although in this kind of
comparison we are somewhat limited by systematic uncertainties, such as those
related to the atomic parameters used to derive the chemical compositions.
  We discuss the implications of our result with regard to strong-line
abundance indicators commonly used to estimate the chemical compositions of
star-forming galaxies, such as R23. By applying a few popular calibrations of
these indices based on grids of photoionization models on the NGC 300 HII
region fluxes we find metallicities that are higher by 0.3 dex (a factor of
two) or more relative to our nebular (Te-based) and stellar ones.

obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction
of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be
employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and

for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize
the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a
detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this
area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information,
specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused

difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in

consideration of the coupling of the r-modes and the stellar spin and thermal
evolutions, we carefully investigate the influences of the r-mode-induced
differential rotation on the long-term evolutions of isolated NSs and NSs in
low-mass X-ray binaries, where the viscous damping of the r-modes and its
resultant effects are taken into account. The numerical results show that, for
both kinds of NSs, the differential rotation can prolong the duration of the
r-mode saturation state significantly. As a result, the stars can keep nearly
constant temperature and angular velocity over a thousand years. Moreover, due
to the long-term steady rotation of the stars, persistent quasi-monochromatic
gravitational wave radiation could be expected, which increases the
detectibility of gravitational waves from both nascent and accreting old NSs.

IGRJ17544-2619 did not, thus we could perform a spectral investigation only of
the spectrum below 10 keV. The broad band spectra from XTEJ1739-302 and
IGRJ08408-4503 were compatible with the X-ray spectral shape displayed during
the previous flares. A variable absorbing column density during the flare was
observed in XTEJ1739-302 for the first time. The broad band spectrum of
IGRJ08408-4503 requires the presence of two distinct photon populations, a cold
one (0.3 keV) most likely from a thermal halo around the neutron star and a
hotter one (1.4-1.8 keV) from the accreting column. The outburst from
XTEJ1739-302 could be monitored with a very good sampling, thus revealing a
shape which can be explained with a second wind component in this SFXT, in

investigated in this paper by the cavity method. At finite temperatures, the
free energy density of these coding systems is derived and compared with the
result obtained by the replica method. In the zero temperature limit, the
Shannon's bound is recovered in the case of infinite-body interactions while
the code rate is still finite. However, the decoding performance as obtained by
the replica theory has not considered the zero-temperature entropic effect. The
cavity approach is able to consider the ground-state entropy. It leads to a set
of evanescent cavity fields propagation equations which further improve the
decoding performance, as confirmed by our numerical simulations on single
instances. For the irregular Sourlas code, we find that it takes the trade-off
between good dynamical property and high performance of decoding. In agreement
with the results found from the algorithmic point of view, the decoding
exhibits a first order phase transition as occurs in the regular code system
with three-body interactions. The cavity approach for the Sourlas code system
can be extended to consider first-step replica-symmetry-breaking.

paper is to give an explicit description of the dual quantum group for this
example involving the quantized enveloping algebra U_q(su(1,1)). It turns out
that U_q(su(1,1)) does not suffice to generate the dual quantum group. The dual
quantum group is graded with respect to commutation and anticommutation with a
suitable analogue of the Casimir operator characterized by an affiliation
relation to a von Neumann algebra. This is used to obtain an explicit set of

the quantum group analogue of the normalizer of SU(1,1) in SL(2,C) is
decomposed into irreducible corepresentations. Upon restricting the irreducible

brane's position in the isometry directions can play the role of curvatons. The
basic picture is that the fluctuations of the (anti-)D3-brane in the angular
isometry directions during inflation eventually turns into the primordial
curvature perturbations, and subsequently the brane's oscillation excites other
open string modes on the brane and reheat the universe. We find in the explicit
case of the KS throat that a wide range of parameters allows a consistent
curvaton scenario. It is also shown that the oscillations of branes at throat
tips are capable of producing large non-Gaussianity, either through curvature
or isocurvature perturbations. Since such setups naturally arise in warped
(multi-)throat compactifications and are constrained by observational data, the
model can provide tests for compactification scenarios. This work gives an
explicit example of string theory providing light fields for generating
curvature perturbations. Such mechanisms free the inflaton from being
responsible for the perturbations, thus open up new possibilities for inflation
models.

development, progressively displacing neuronal cell bodies from each other. At
present, little is known about how cortical growth affects the development of
neuronal circuits. Here, in acute and chronic experiments, we study the layout
of ocular dominance (OD) columns in cat primary visual cortex (V1) during a
period of substantial postnatal growth. We find that despite a considerable
size increase of V1, the spacing between columns is largely preserved. In
contrast, their spatial arrangement changes systematically over this period.
While in young animals columns are more band-like, layouts become more
isotropic in mature animals. We propose a novel mechanism of growth-induced
reorganization that is based on the `zigzag instability', a dynamical
instability observed in several inanimate pattern forming systems. We argue
that this mechanism is inherent to a wide class of models for the
activity-dependent formation of OD columns. Analyzing one member of this class,
the Elastic Network model, we show that this mechanism can account for the
preservation of column spacing and the specific mode of reorganization of OD
columns that we observe. We conclude that neurons systematically shift their
selectivities during normal development and that this reorganization is induced
by the cortical expansion during growth. Our work suggests that cortical
circuits remain plastic for an extended period in development in order to
facilitate the modification of neuronal circuits to adjust for cortical growth.

second order perturbation theory combined with local approximation. The
temperature dependence of the specific heat $c_{\rm v}(T)$ is calculated as a
function of temperature $T$ from the numerical derivative of the internal

Little is known about the orbits of the different populations of cluster

the orbits of cluster galaxies using two samples of galaxy clusters spanning
similar (evolutionary corrected) mass ranges at different redshifts. The
low-redshift (z~0.0-0.1) sample is extracted from the ENACS catalog and the
high-redshift (z~0.4-0.8) sample is mostly made of clusters from the EDisCS.
For each of these samples, we solve the Jeans equation for hydrostatic
equilibrium separately for two cluster galaxy populations, characterized by the
presence and, respectively, absence of emission-lines in their spectra ('ELGs'
and 'nELGs' hereafter). Using two tracers of the gravitational potential allows
to partially break the well known mass-velocity anisotropy degeneracy.
  We find no significant evolution for the orbits of ELGs. On the other hand
the orbits of nELGs do evolve, from radial to isotropic with time. We speculate
that this evolution may be driven by the secular mass growth of galaxy clusters
during their fast accretion phase. The mass density profiles of the clusters
are well fit by NFW models both in the low-z and in the high-z samples. The
best-fit NFW concentrations and their redshift evolution are in agreement with
the predictions of Lambda CDM cosmological simulations. The evolution of the
number density profile of nELGs is opposite to that of the mass density
profile, becoming less concentrated with time, probably a result of the
transformation of ELGs into nELGs [abridged].

distributions, moments of these distributions and $\chi^2$-combinations of them

97.3% for the mean when regarding the KQ75-masked full sky and summing up over
all considered length scales by means of a diagonal $\chi^2$-statistics.
Looking at only the northern or southern hemisphere, we obtain up to 98.5% or
96.6%, respectively. For the standard deviation, these results appear as 95.6%
for the full sky (99.7% north, 89.4% south) and for a $\chi^2$-combination of
both measurements as 97.4% (99.1% north, 95.5% south). By performing an
analysis of rotated hemispheres, we detect an obvious asymmetry in the data. In
addition to these investigations, we present a method of filling the mask with
Gaussian noise to eliminate boundary effects caused by the mask. With the help
of this technique, we identify several local features on the map, of which the
most significant one turns out to be the well-known cold spot. When excluding
all these spots from the analysis, the deviation from Gaussianity increases,
which shows that the discovered local anomalies are not the reason of the
global detection of non-Gaussianity, but actually were damping the deviations
on average. Our analyses per band and per year suggest, however, that it is
very unlikely that the detected anomalies are due to foreground effects.

the phenomena involved in the degradation process. Inference from such a BN
needs to specify a great number of marginal and conditional probabilities. As,
in the present context, information is based essentially on expert knowledge,
this task becomes very complex and rapidly impossible. We present a solution
which consists of considering the BN as a log-linear model on which
simplification constraints are assumed. This approach results in a considerable
decrease in the number of probabilities to be given by experts. In addition, we
give some simple rules to choose the most reliable probabilities. We show that
making use of those rules allows to check the consistency of the derived
probabilities. Moreover, we propose a feedback procedure to eliminate
inconsistent probabilities. Finally, the derived probabilities that we propose
to solve the equations involved in a realistic Bayesian network are expected to
be reliable. The resulting methodology to design a significant and powerful BN
is applied to a reactor coolant sub-component in EDF Nuclear plants in an
illustrative purpose.

flavor democracy the Dirac masses of the fourth SM family fermions are almost
equal with preferable value 450 GeV, which corresponds to common (for all

principle, one expect u4 a little bit lighter than d4, while nu4 could be
essentially lighter than l4 due to Majorana mass terms for right-handed
components of neutrinos. Obviously, the fourth family quarks will be copiously
produced at the LHC. However, the first indication of the fourth SM family may
be provided by early Higgs boson observation due to almost an order enhancement
of the gluon fusion to Higgs cross-section. For the same reason the Tevatron
still has a chance to observe the Higgs boson before the LHC. Concerning the
fourth family leptons, in general, best place will be NLC/CLIC. However, for

lines at several positions, constraining the gas temperatures to a constant
value of ~100 K along the red outflow axis and to ~60 K for the blue outflow.
The derived outflow mass is of order 0.4--0.8 M_sol, significantly higher than
previously found. The bulk of the strong high-J CO line emission has a
surprisingly narrow width, however, even at outflow positions. These lines
cannot be fit by a passively heated model of the HH 46 IRS envelope. We propose
that it originates from photon heating of the outflow cavity walls by
ultraviolet photons originating in outflow shocks and the accretion disk
boundary layers. At the position of the bow shock itself, the UV photons are
energetic enough to dissociate CO. The envelope mass of ~5 M_sol is strongly
concentrated towards HH 46 IRS with a density power law of -1.8.

because of its electrically tunable energy gaps and its unusual electronic

expressions, based on the four-band continuum model, for the layer-sum and
layer-difference density response functions of neutral and doped BLG. These
results demonstrate that BLG density-fluctuations can exhibit either
single-component massive-chiral character or standard two-layer character,

aimed to the discovery of the very small distortions such those associated to
the cosmological reionization process or that could be generated by different
kinds of earlier processes. The interpretation of future data calls for a
continuous improvement in the theoretical modeling of CMB spectrum. Aims: In
this work we describe the fundamental approach and, in particular, the update
to recent NAG versions of a numerical code, KYPRIX, specifically written for
the solution of the Kompaneets equation in cosmological context, first
implemented in the years 1989-1991, aimed at the very accurate computation of
the CMB spectral distortions under quite general assumptions. Methods: We
describe the structure and the main subdivisions of the code and discuss the
most relevant aspects of its technical implementation. Results: We present some
of fundamental tests we carried out to verify the accuracy, reliability, and
performance of the code. Conclusions: All the tests done demonstrates the
reliability and versatility of the new code version and its very good accuracy
and applicability to the scientific analysis of current CMB spectrum data and
of much more precise measurements that will be available in the future. The
recipes and tests described in this work can be also useful to implement
accurate numerical codes for other scientific purposes using the same or
similar numerical libraries or to verify the validity of different codes aimed
at the same or similar problems.

minor arcs Egalite(2,1), Liberte, and Courage are located at positions where
the time averaged forces, due to the 42-43 corotation-Lindblad resonances under
the central field of Neptune, vanish. With adequately chosen Fraternite mass
and Galatea eccentricity, this model gives minor arc locations compatible to
observed positions, and allows a dynamic transport of materials among arcs. To
complement this model, the effect of self-gravity of Fraternite, with a
distributed mass, is evaluated together with the CER potential to account for
its $10^{0}$ longitudinal span. Although self-gravity is the collective action
of all the particles in the arc, each individual particle will see the
self-potential with a central maximum as an external potential generated by
other particles.

J2127.4+5654 with Suzaku. We report the detection of a broad relativistic iron
emission line from the inner accretion disc. By assuming that the inner edge of
the accretion disc corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of the
black hole spacetime, the line profile enables us to measure a black hole spin
a= 0.6\pm0.2. However, a non-rotating Schwarzschild spacetime is excluded at
just above the 3 sigma level, while a maximally spinning Kerr black hole is
excluded at the ~5 sigma level. The intermediate spin we measure may indicate
that accretion-driven black hole growth in this source proceeds through
short-lived episodes with chaotic angular momentum alignment between the disc
and the hole rather than via prolonged accretion. The measured steep emissivity
index (q~5) constrains the irradiating X-ray source to be very centrally
concentrated. Light bending may help focus the primary emission towards the
innermost accretion disc, thus steepening the irradiation profile. On the other
hand, steep profiles can also be reached if magnetic extraction of the hole
rotational energy is at work. If this is the case, the interplay between
accretion (spinning up the black hole) and rotational energy extraction
(spinning it down) forces the hole to reach an equilibrium spin value which,
under standard assumptions, is remarkably consistent with our measurement.
Rotational energy extraction would then be able to simultaneously account for
the intermediate spin and steep emissivity profile we infer from our spectral
analysis without the need to invoke chaotic accretion episodes. (abridged)

is no fundamental limitations on the number of radiation sources, geometry or
the optical depth of the problems that can be studied with the method. However,
as expected for any Monte-Carlo transfer scheme, stochastic noise presents a
serious limitation. We present a number of tests that show that the errors of
the method can be estimated accurately by considering Poisson noise
fluctuations in the number of photon packets that SPH particles interact with
per dynamical time. It is found that for a reasonable accuracy the momentum
carried by photon packets must be much smaller than a typical momentum of SPH
particles. We discuss numerical limitations of the code, and future steps that
can be taken to improve performance and applicability of the method.

spots orbiting near the inner stable circular orbit (ISCO) of black hole and
has a hard spectrum that extends to above MeV bands determined by electron
acceleration rate. These photons are then down-scattered by the surrounding
plasma and form an observed steep spectrum. The relevance of this model with
high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) and extremely high
luminosity of the SPL state is discussed.

Tuc, taken at the Mt. John University Observatory in 2007, were analyzed using
two methods: cross-correlation and Fourier--based disentangling. As a result,
new radial velocity curves of both components were obtained. The resulting
orbital elements of CF Tuc are: $a_{1}{\sin}i$=$0.0254\pm0.0001$ AU,
$a_{2}{\sin}i$=$0.0228\pm0.0001$ AU, $M_{1}{\sin}i$=$0.902\pm0.005$
$M_{\odot}$, and $M_{2}{\sin}i$=$1.008\pm0.006$ $M_{\odot}$. The cooler
component of the system shows H$\alpha$ and CaII H & K emissions. Our
spectroscopic data and recent $BV$ light curves were solved simultaneously
using the Wilson-Devinney code. A dark spot on the surface of the cooler
component was assumed to explain large asymmetries observed in the light
curves. The following absolute parameters of the components were determined:
$M_{1}$=$1.11\pm0.01$ $M_{\odot}$, $M_{2}$=$1.23\pm0.01$ $M_{\odot}$,
$R_{1}$=$1.63\pm0.02$ $R_{\odot}$, $R_{2}$=$3.60\pm0.02$ $R_{\odot}$,
$L_{1}$=$3.32\pm0.51$ $L_{\odot}$ and $L_{2}$=$3.91\pm0.84$ $L_{\odot}$. The
orbital period of the system was studied using the O-C analysis. The O-C
diagram could be interpreted in terms of either two abrupt changes or a
quasi-sinusoidal form superimposed on a downward parabola. These variations are
discussed by reference to the combined effect of mass transfer and mass loss,
the Applegate mechanism and also a light-time effect due to the existence of a
massive third body (possibly a black hole) in the system. The distance to CF
Tuc was calculated to be $89\pm6$ pc from the dynamic parallax, neglecting
interstellar absorption, in agreement with the Hipparcos value.

millisecond pulsars is investigated. Subtraction of the known resolved point
sources leads to detectable levels of unresolved emission in the core region of
M28, NGC 6440, M62, and NGC 6752. The X-ray luminosities in the 0.3-8 keV
energy band of this emission component were found to lie in the range $\sim 1.5
\times 10^{31}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ (NGC 6752) to $\sim 2.2 \times 10^{32}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$ (M28). The lowest limiting luminosity for X-ray source detections
amongst these four clusters was $1.1 \times 10^{30}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ for NGC
6752. The spectrum of the unresolved emission can be fit equally well by a
power-law, a thermal bremsstrahlung model, a black body plus power-law, or a
thermal bremsstrahlung model plus black body component. The unresolved emission
is considered to arise from the cumulative contribution of active binaries,
cataclysmic variables, and faint millisecond pulsars with their associated
pulsar wind nebulae. In examining the available X-ray data, no evidence for any
pulsar wind nebular emission in globular clusters is found. It is shown that
the X-ray luminosity contribution of a faint source population based on an
extrapolation of the luminosity function of detected point sources is
compatible with the unresolved X-ray emission in the cores of NGC 6440 and NGC
6752. Adopting the same slope for the luminosity function for M62 as for NGC
6440 and NGC 6752 leads to a similar result for M62. For M28, the contribution
from faint sources in the core can attain a level comparable with the observed
value if a steeper slope is adopted. The characteristics on the faint source
population as constrained by the properties of the unresolved X-ray emission
are briefly discussed.

five-level DIGS system. The system consists of a $\Lambda$ atom prepared as in
standard electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), with two additional
metastable ground states coupled to the $\Lambda$ atom ground states by two
RF/microwave fields. We consider two configurations by which population is
incoherently pumped into the ground states of the atom. Under appropriate
circumstances, we predict a pair of new gain lines with tunable width,
separation, and height. Between these lines, absorption vanishes but dispersion
is large and anomalous. The system described here is a significant improvement
over other proposals in the anomalous dispersion literature in that it permits
additional coherent control over the spectral properties of the anomalous
region, including a possible $10^4$-fold increase over the group delay observed
by Wang, Kuzmich, and Dogariu.

  The scientific information available for low-income countries is scattered

country- or institution-specific programmes. It is therefore quite hard for
individual researchers to see the whole picture and establish what actually is
available and what is not.
  This paper presents a number of key information sources for mathematics. Some
are aimed primarily at disciplines other than mathematics but nevertheless

grain boundaries, occurs when the lattice configuration loses stability, that
is, when an eigenvalue of the Hessian of the lattice energy functional becomes
negative. When the atomistic energy is approximated by a hybrid energy that
couples atomistic and continuum models, the accuracy of the approximation can
only be guaranteed near deformations where both the atomistic energy as well as
the hybrid energy are stable. We propose, therefore, that it is essential for
the evaluation of the predictive capability of atomistic-to-continuum coupling
methods near instabilities that a theoretical analysis be performed, at least
for some representative model problems, that determines whether the hybrid
energies remain stable {\em up to the onset of instability of the atomistic
energy}. We formulate a one-dimensional model problem with nearest and
next-nearest neighbor interactions and use rigorous analysis, asymptotic
methods, and numerical experiments to obtain such sharp stability estimates for
the basic conservative quasicontinuum (QC) approximations. Our results show
that the consistent quasi-nonlocal QC approximation correctly reproduces the
stability of the atomistic system, whereas the inconsistent energy-based QC
approximation incorrectly predicts instability at a significantly reduced
applied load that we describe by an analytic criterion in terms of the
derivatives of the atomistic potential.

error-correcting codes that have the ""single local orbit"" property: i.e., they

whose coordinates are indexed by elements of F_{2^n} for prime n, and whose
symmetry group includes the group of non-singular affine transformations of
F_{2^n} has the single local orbit property. (A code is said to be ""sparse"" if
it contains polynomially many codewords in its block length.) In particular
this class includes the dual-BCH codes for whose duals (i.e., for BCH codes)
simple bases were not known. Our result gives the first short (O(n)-bit, as
opposed to the natural exp(n)-bit) description of a low-weight basis for BCH
codes. The interest in the ""single local orbit"" property comes from the recent
result of Kaufman and Sudan (STOC 2008) that shows that the duals of codes that
have the single local orbit property under the affine symmetry group are
locally testable. When combined with our main result, this shows that all
sparse affine-invariant codes over the coordinates F_{2^n} for prime n are
locally testable. If, in addition to n being prime, if 2^n-1 is also prime
(i.e., 2^n-1 is a Mersenne prime), then we get that every sparse cyclic code
also has the single local orbit. In particular this implies that BCH codes of
Mersenne prime length are generated by a single low-weight codeword and its
cyclic shifts.
