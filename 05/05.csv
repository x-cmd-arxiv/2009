the strongest, most falsifiable condition that one can impose on string theory
at the high scale: it at once excludes a vast majority of the string landscape,
and yet leads naturally to constructions that can be surprisingly realistic
(and familiar). Yet only for local models can gravity be made parametrically
weak while keeping the strength of gauge- and Yukawa-couplings fixed--a limit
which is well-motivated by low-energy experiments. Conveniently, the entire
class of high-scale effective field theories that can arise from such local
models in F-theory and M-theory can be classified according to simple, purely
group-theoretic rules. In this note, we describe these rules from the viewpoint
of an effective field theorist with little interest in the underlying geometry
or high-scale physics, and we discuss the general predictions these models have
for low-energy phenomenology.

is separable can be considered to be the sum of three contributions. One is
from those states that are absolutely separable, that is those (which can not
be entangled by unitary transformations) for which the maximal concurrence over
spectral orbits (C_{max}) is zero. The other two contributions are from the
states for which C_{max} in [0,1/2], and for which C_{max} in [1/2,1]. We have
previously (arXiv:0805.0267) found exact formulas for the absolutely separable
contributions in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt metric over the quantum states,
and here advance hypotheses as to the exact contributions for C_{max} in
[1/2,1]. A crucial element in understanding the other two contributions is the
nature of the ratio (R) of the C_{max}-parameterized separability function for
the complex states to the square of the comparable function for the real
states--both such functions having clearly displayed jump discontinuities at
C_{max}=1/2. For C_{max} in [0,1/2], R appears to be of the form 1+ k C_{max},
except near C_{max}=1/2, while for C_{max} in [1/2,1], it seems to be a
constant (thus according to the Dyson-index pattern of random matrix theory).
Related phenomena also occur for the minimally-degenerate two-qubit states and
the qubit-qutrit states. Our results have immediate application to the
computation of separability probabilities in terms of other metrics, such as
the Bures (minimal monotone) metric. The paper begins with continuous
embeddings of the separability probability question in terms of four metrics of
interest, using ""generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions"".

measurement of the parity-violating neutron spin rotation in helium due to the

neutrons that passed through a crossed neutron polarizer--analyzer pair with
the liquid helium target system located between them. Changes between the
target states generated differences in the beam transmission through the
polarizer--analyzer pair. The amount of parity-violating spin rotation was
determined from the measured beam transmission asymmetries. The expected
parity-violating spin rotation of order $10^{-6}$ rad placed severe constraints
on the target design. In particular, isolation of the parity-odd component of
the spin rotation from a much larger background rotation caused by magnetic
fields required that a nonmagnetic cryostat and target system be supported
inside the magnetic shielding, while allowing nonmagnetic motion of liquid
helium between separated target chambers. This paper provides a detailed
description of the design, function, and performance of the liquid helium
target system.

and usually classified as slow, fast, or Alfv\'en. The possibility that these
waves have mixed properties is often ignored. The goal of this work is to study
and determine the nature of MHD kink waves. This is done by calculating the
frequency, the damping rate and the eigenfunctions of MHD kink waves for three
widely different MHD waves cases: a compressible pressure-less plasma, an
incompressible plasma and a compressible plasma with non-zero plasma pressure
which allows for MHD radiation. In all three cases the frequency and the
damping rate are for practical purposes the same as they differ at most by
terms proportional to $(k_z R)^2$. In the magnetic flux tube the kink waves are
in all three cases, to a high degree of accuracy incompressible waves with
negligible pressure perturbations and with mainly horizontal motions. The main
restoring force of kink waves in the magnetised flux tube is the magnetic
tension force. The total pressure gradient force cannot be neglected except
when the frequency of the kink wave is equal or slightly differs from the local
Alfv\'{e}n frequency, i.e. in the resonant layer. Kink waves are very robust
and do not care about the details of the MHD wave environment. The adjective
fast is not the correct adjective to characterise kink waves. If an adjective
is to be used it should be Alfv\'{e}nic. However, it is better to realize that
kink waves have mixed properties and cannot be put in one single box.

created between members of the chain. In the setup considered here, we found
that a great family of nonclassical (squeezed) states can localize entanglement
in such a way that distant oscillators never become entangled. We present a
detailed study of this particular localization phenomenon. Our results may find
application in future solid state implementations of quantum computers, and we

detect if the masses of the planets differ by a factor larger than $\sim 4$.
This is consistent with the present population of real exosystems in the 2/1

masses, and could indicate that many other resonant systems exist, but are
presently beyond the detectability limit.
  Furthermore, we analyze the error distribution in masses and orbital elements

that the eccentricity of the outer planet is systematically over estimated,
although the inner planet's eccentricity suffers a much smaller effect. If the
initial conditions correspond to small amplitude oscillations around stable
apsidal corotation resonances (ACR), the amplitudes estimated from the orbital
fits are biased toward larger amplitudes, in accordance to results found in
real resonant extrasolar systems.

combinations of fluids and surfaces. This paper describes the origin of such
transitions, for liquid films on solid surfaces, in terms of the gas-surface
interaction potentials V(r), which depend on the specific adsorption system.
The transitions of light inert gases and H2 molecules on alkali metal surfaces
have been explored extensively and are relatively well understood in terms of
the least attractive adsorption interactions in nature. Much less thoroughly
investigated are wetting transitions of Hg, water, heavy inert gases and other
molecular films. The basic idea is that nonwetting occurs, for energetic
reasons, if the adsorption potential's well-depth D is smaller than, or
comparable to, the well-depth of the adsorbate-adsorbate mutual interaction. At
the wetting temperature, Tw, the transition to wetting occurs, for entropic
reasons, when the liquid's surface tension is sufficiently small that the free
energy cost in forming a thick film is sufficiently compensated by the fluid-
surface interaction energy. Guidelines useful for exploring wetting transitions
of other systems are analyzed, in terms of generic criteria involving the
""simple model"", which yields results in terms of gas-surface interaction
parameters and thermodynamic properties of the bulk adsorbate.

adjustment of the AUC. Models with normal errors and non-normal errors are
discussed and analysed separately. Nonparametric regression is used for
estimating mean and variance functions in both scenarios. In the general noise
case we propose a covariate-adjusted Mann-Whitney estimator for AUC estimation
which effectively uses available data to construct working samples at any
covariate value of interest and is computationally efficient for
implementation. This provides a generalisation of the Mann-Whitney approach for
comparing two populations by taking covariate effects into account. We derive
asymptotic properties for the AUC estimators in both settings, including
asymptotic normality, optimal strong uniform convergence rates and MSE
consistency. The usefulness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through
simulated and real data examples.

flurry of publications interpreting these observations either as a possible
signature from the decay of dark matter or as a contribution from isolated
astrophysical sources. While those interpretations are scientifically exciting,
the possibility that measurements are contaminated by misidentified cosmic ray
protons can not be ignored.

1999. Using data up to the end of 2007 (as available to S08) or to the end of

excellent axial resolution can be obtained in a photon-counting coherence

stoichiometric lithium tantalate (chirped-PPSLT) structure, in conjunction with
a niobium nitride superconducting single-photon detector (SSPD). The bandwidth
of the light generated via SPDC, as well as the bandwidth over which the SSPD
is sensitive, can extend over a wavelength region that stretches from 700 to
1500 nm. This ultra-broad wavelength band offers a near-ideal combination of
deep penetration and ultra-high axial resolution for the imaging of biological
tissue. The generation of SPDC light of adjustable bandwidth in the vicinity of
1064 nm, via the use of chirped-PPSLT structures, had not been previously
achieved. To demonstrate the usefulness of this technique, we have constructed
images for a hierarchy of samples of increasing complexity: a mirror, a

The maximum spectral ages estimated for the detected radio emission in the
lobes of our sample of ten sources has a median value of $\sim$20 Myr. The
spectral ages of these GRSs are significantly older than smaller sources. In
all but one source (J1313+6937) the spectral age gradually increases with
distance from the hotspot regions, confirming that acceleration of the
particles mainly occurs in the hotspots. Most of the GRSs do not exhibit zero
spectral ages in the hotspots. This is likely to be largely due to
contamination by more extended emission due to relatively modest resolutions.
The injection spectral indices range from $\sim$0.55 to 0.88 with a median
value of $\sim$0.6. We show that the injection spectral index appears to be
correlated with luminosity and/or redshift as well as with linear size.

function for which the signal-to-noise ratio is only slowly degrading with
time. This is in contrast to the exponential degradation of the signal-to-noise
ratio that is observed at larger times, and is due to the suppressed overlap of
the source and sink interpolating-operators that are associated with the
variance of the three-baryon correlation function onto the lightest eigenstates
in the lattice volume

the calculation of the structure and reactions of light nuclei, we also present

asymmetric information degrees. This model is quite simple and can be treated
analytically since the buyers evaluate the quality of a certain good taking
into account only the quality of the last good purchased plus her perceptive
capacity \beta . As a consequence the system evolves according to a stationary
Markovian stochastic process. The value of a product offered by the seller
increases with quality according to the exponent \alpha, which is a measure of
technology. It incorporates all the technological capacity of production
systems such as education, scientific development and techniques that change
the productivity growth. The technological level plays an important role to
explain how the asymmetry of information may affect the market evolution in
this model. We observe that, for high technological levels, the market can
control adverse selection. The model allows us to compute the maximum
asymmetric information degree before market collapse. Below this critical point
the market evolves during a very limited time and then dies out completely.
When \beta is closer to 1(symmetric information), the market becomes more
profitable for high quality goods, although high and low quality markets
coexist. All the results we obtained from the model are analytical and the
maximum asymmetric information level is a consequence of an ergodicity
breakdown in the process of quality evaluation.

the cases of the giant ellipticals NGC 1399 and NGC 4486, and assumes that the
two dominant GC populations form along diffuse stellar populations sharing the

Integrated galaxy colours can be matched to within the photometric
uncertainties and are consistent with a narrow range of ages; b) The inferred
mass to luminosity ratios and stellar masses are within the range of values
available in the literature; c) Most globular cluster systems occupy a thick
plane in the volume space defined by the cluster formation efficiency, total
stellar mass and projected surface mass density. The formation efficiency
parameter of the red clusters shows a dependency with projected stellar mass
density that is absent for the blue globulars. In turn, the brightest galaxies
appear clearly detached from that plane as a possible consequence of major past
mergers; d) The stellar mass-metallicity relation is relatively shallow but
shows a slope change at $M_*\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$. Galaxies with smaller
stellar masses show predominantly unimodal globular cluster colour
distributions. This result may indicate that less massive galaxies are not able
to retain chemically enriched intestellar matter.

AGNs detected by BAT, the population of blazars shows strong positive
evolution. This evolution is comparable to the evolution of luminous optical
QSOs and luminous X-ray selected AGNs. We also find evidence for an
epoch-dependence of the evolution as determined previously for radio-quiet
AGNs. We interpret both these findings as a strong link between accretion and
jet activity. In our sample, the FSRQs evolve strongly, while our best-fit
shows that BL Lacs might not evolve at all. The blazar population accounts for
10-20 % (depending on the evolution of the BL Lacs) of the Cosmic X-ray
background (CXB) in the 15--55 keV band. We find that FSRQs can explain the
entire CXB emission for energies above 500 keV solving the mystery of the
generation of the MeV background. The evolution of luminous FSRQs shows a peak
in redshift ($z_c$=4.3$\pm0.5$) which is larger than the one observed in QSOs

correctly predict the behavior of the power spectrum at the onset of
non-linearity, and improve upon a pure linear theory description at very large
scales. All of these theories fail at sufficiently small scales. At low
redshift the dynamic range in scale where perturbation theory is both relevant
and reliable can be quite small. We also compute for the first time the 2-loop
contribution to standard perturbation theory for CDM models, finding improved
agreement with simulations at large redshift. At low redshifts however the
2-loop term is larger than the 1-loop term on quasi-linear scales, indicating a
breakdown of the perturbation expansion. Finally, we comment on possible

spins between their two energy minima, Sz=+- S, under resonant conditions when
the change of the Zeeman energy in magnetic dipolar field of other electronic
spins is compensated by interaction with nuclear spins. Transitions of resonant
spins can result in opening or closing resonances in their neighbors leading to
the collective dynamics at sufficiently large density P0 of resonant spins. We
formulate and solve the equivalent dynamic percolation problem for the Bethe

the density of resonant spins P0 and the number of neighbors z the system has
either one (2<z<6) or two (z > 5) kinetic transitions at P_{0}=Pc1 ~

associated with the formation of an infinite cluster of coupled resonant spins
similarly to the static percolation transition occurring at P0 ~ 1/z. The
latter transition, z>5, is discontinuous and associated with the instantaneous
increase in the density of resonant spins from the small value ~ 1/z to near

example, in order to boost final luminosity in a muon collider or neutrino
factory, where short particle lifetimes severely limit the total time available
to reduce beam phase space. But fast cooling requires very high-bandwidth
amplifiers so as to limit the incoherent heating effects from neighboring
particles. A method of transit-time optical stochastic cooling has been
proposed which would employ high-gain, high-bandwidth, solid-state lasers to
amplify the spontaneous radiation from the charged particle bunch in a
strong-field magnetic wiggler. This amplified light is then fed back onto the
same bunch inside a second wiggler, with appropriate phase delay to effect
cooling. But before amplification, the usable signal from any one particle is
quite small, on average much less than one photon per pass, suggesting that the
radiation should be treated quantum mechanically, and raising doubts as to
whether this weak signal even contains sufficient phase information necessary
for cooling, and whether it can be reliably amplified to provide the expected
cooling on each pass. A careful examination of the dynamics, where the
radiation and amplification processes are treated quantum mechanically,
indicates that fast cooling is in principle possible, with cooling rates which
essentially agree with classical calculations, provided that the effects of the
unavoidable amplifier noise are included. Thus, quantum mechanical
uncertainties do not present any insurmountable obstacles to optical cooling,
but do establish a lower limit on cooling rates and achievable emittances.

light curves with the published Ic-band light curve and radial velocities to
provide refined measurements of the system's physical parameters. The component
masses and radii are here determined with an accuracy of ~6.5% and ~1.5%,
respectively. We confirm the previous surprising finding that the primary brown
dwarf has a cooler effective temperature than its companion. Next, we perform a
detailed study of the variations in the out-of-eclipse phases of the light
curves to ascertain the properties of any inhomogeneities on the surfaces of
the brown dwarfs. Our analysis reveals two low-amplitude periodic signals, one
attributable to the rotation of the primary (with a period of 3.293+/-0.001 d)
and the other to that of the secondary (14.05+/-0.05 d). Finally, we explore
the effects on the derived physical parameters of the system when spots are
included in the modeling. The observed low-amplitude rotational modulations are
well fit by cool spots covering a small fraction of their surfaces. To mimic
the observed ~200 K suppression of the primary's temperature, our model
requires that the primary possess a very large spot coverage fraction of ~65%.
Altogether, a spot configuration in which the primary is heavily spotted while
the secondary is lightly spotted can explain the apparent temperature reversal
and can bring the temperatures of the brown dwarfs into agreement with the
predictions of theoretical models.

E0102 (SNR 1E0102.2-7219) in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The infrared spectra
show strong ejecta lines of Ne and O, with the [Ne II] line at 12.8 microns
having a large velocity dispersion of 2,000-4,500 km/s indicative of
fast-moving ejecta. Unlike the young Galactic SNR Cas A, E0102 lacks emission
from Ar and Fe. Diagnostics of the observed [Ne III] line pairs imply that [Ne
III] emitting ejecta have a low temperature of 650 K, while [Ne V] line pairs
imply that the infrared [Ne V] emitting ejecta have a high density of
~10^4/cm3. We have calculated radiative shock models for various velocity
ranges including the effects of photoionization. The shock model indicates that
the [Ne V] lines come mainly from the cooling zone, which is hot and dense,
whereas [Ne II] and [Ne III] come mainly from the photoinization zone, which
has a low temperature of 400-1000 K. We estimate an infrared emitting Ne ejecta
mass of 0.04 Msun from the infrared observations, and discuss implications for
the progenitor mass. The spectra also have a dust continuum feature peaking at
18 microns that coincides spatially with the ejecta, providing evidence that
dust formed in the expanding ejecta. The 18-micron-peak dust feature is fitted
by a mixture of MgSiO3 and Si dust grains, while the rest of the continuum
requires either carbon or Al2O3 grains. We measure the total dust mass formed
within the ejecta of E0102 to be ~0.014 Msun. The dust mass in E0102 is thus a
factor of a few smaller than that in Cas A. The composition of the dust is also
different, showing relatively less silicate and likely no Fe-bearing dust, as
is suggested by the absence of Fe-emitting ejecta.

substantial fraction of the visible universe to quantify dark energy through
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). At increasing redshift, for example that
probed by proposed 21-cm intensity mapping surveys, gravitational lensing
potentially limits the fidelity (Hui et al., 2007) because it distorts the
apparent matter distribution. In this paper we show that these distortions can
be reconstructed, and actually used to map the distribution of intervening dark
matter. The lensing information for sources at z=1-3 allows accurate
reconstruction of the gravitational potential on large scales, l <~ 100, which
is well matched for Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect measurements of dark
energy and its sound speed, and a strong constraint for modified gravity models
of dark energy.
  We built an optimal quadratic lensing estimator for non-Gaussian sources,
which is necessary for LSS. The phenomenon of ""information saturation"" (Rimes &
Hamilton, 2005) saturates reconstruction at mildly non-linear scales, where the
linear source power spectrum Delta^2 ~ 0.2-0.5. We find that steeper power
spectra, saturate more quickly. We compute the effective number densities of
independent lensing sources for LSS lensing, and find that they increase
rapidly with redshifts. For LSS/21-cm sources at z ~ 2-4, the lensing
reconstruction is limited by cosmic variance at l<~ 100.

that non-linear growth induced non-Gaussianity could lead to a factor of ~4

mitigated by realistic levels of shot noise and we find that for future
surveys, the effect is closer to a factor of 1.5. To do so, we develop a new

unbiased estimator with an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy with only
twice more simulations than previously used. Finally, we evaluate the error on

none of the flat-spectrum radio quasars are detectable with IceCube. If the
primary high energy proton spectrum is very hard and/or neutrinos are produced
in proton-photon, rather than proton-proton reactions, the upper limit on the
neutrino flux imposed by the measured gamma-ray spectra is relaxed and
gamma-ray observations impose only lower bounds on the neutrino flux. We
investigate whether these lower bounds guarantee the detection of blazars with
very hard neutrino spectra, expected in the latter type model. We show that all
the ""hadronic"" models of activity of blazars are falsifiable with IceCube.
Furthermore, we show that models with gamma-ray emission produced by the decay
of neutral pions from proton-proton interactions can be readily distinguished
from the models based on proton-gamma interactions and/or models predicting
very hard high energy proton spectra via a study of the distribution of
spectral indices of gamma-ray spectra of sources detected with IceCube.

development of a formalism for handling such extensions, including non-ergodic

extensions, of the Furstenberg-Zimmer Structure Theory and of results of
Mentzen describing the structure of automorphisms of such extensions when they

for actions of several commuting transformations: firstly to describing the
possible joint distributions of three isotropy factors corresponding to three
commuting transformations; and secondly to describing the characteristic

broader usefulness of this formalism in ergodic theory.

calibrated corrections. More recently, a new test of the importance of
radiation forces has been proposed: the MBH-sigma relation has been used to
estimate MBH for a sample of type-2 AGN and virial relations (with and without
radiation pressure) for a sample of type-1 AGN extracted from the same parent
population. The observed L/LEdd distribution based on virial BH masses is in
good agreement with that based on MBH-sigma only if radiation pressure effects
are negligible, otherwise significant discrepancies are observed. In this paper
we investigate the effects of intrinsic dispersions associated to the virial
relations providing MBH, and we show that they explain the discrepancies
between the observed L/LEdd distributions of type-1 and type-2 AGN. These
discrepancies in the L/LEdd distributions are present regardless of the general
importance of radiation forces, which must be negligible only for a small
fraction of sources with large L/LEdd. Average radiation pressure corrections
should then be applied in virial MBH estimators until their dependence on
observed source physical properties has been fully calibrated. Finally, the
comparison between MBH and L/LEdd distributions derived from sigma-based and
virial estimators can constrain the variance of BLR physical properties in AGN.

exploit this dual algebraic and geometric property of WZW models to construct
an explicit example of a field-dependent reflection matrix for open-strings in
Nappi-Witten model. Demanding the momentum outflow at the boundary to be zero
determines a certain combination of the left and right chiral currents at the
boundary. This same reflection matrix is obtained algebraically from an inner
automorphism, giving rise to a space-filling D-brane. Half of the infinite
dimensional affine Kac-Moody symmetry present in the closed-string theory is
preserved by this unique combination of the left and the right chiral currents.
The OPEs of these boundary currents are computed explicitly and they are showed
to obey the same current algebra as those of the closed-string chiral currents.
Different choices of the inner automorphisms correspond to different background
gauge field configurations. Only those B-field configurations, and the
corresponding D-branes, that preserve the diagonal part of the infinite
dimensional chiral algebras are allowed. In this way the existence of the
D-branes in curved spaces is further constrained by the underlying symmetry of

been optimized in order that the calculated Raman and IR active phonon
frequencies, and lattice parameters match with their experimental values. We
find a close correspondence between the values of the IR phonon frequencies of
PrMnO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$, which shows that the substitution of the Pr$^{3+}$
ions with Ca$^{2+}$ results in a reduction of the frequency of medium- and
high-energy IR phonons, and an increase of the frequency of those of

the two materials appear to be unrelated. A comparative study of the

sources. The sample under study has been selected so as to favour the earliest
evolutionary phases of star formation, and is composed of very luminous objects
(L_bol > 2x10^4 L_sun and up to ~10^6 L_sun), possibly containing O-type stars.
Each source has been mapped in 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1) with the IRAM-30m
telescope on Pico Veleta (Spain). The whole sample shows high-velocity wings in
the 13CO(2-1) spectra, indicative of outflowing motions. In addition, we have
obtained outflow maps in 9 of our 11 sources, which display well-defined blue
and/or red lobes. For these sources, the outflow parameters have been derived
from the line wing 13CO(2-1) emission. An estimate of the clump masses from the
C18O(2-1) emission is also provided and found to be comparable to the virial
masses. From a comparison between our results and those found by other authors
at lower masses, it is clear that the outflow mechanical force increases with
the bolometric luminosity of the clump and with the ionising photon rate of the
associated HII regions, indicating that high-mass stars drive more powerful
outflows. A tight correlation between outflow mass and clump mass is also
found. Molecular outflows are found to be as common in massive star forming
regions as in low-mass star forming regions. This, added to the detection of a
few tentative large-scale rotating structures suggests that high-mass stars may
generally form via accretion, as low-mass stars.

source has, at all frequencies, the spectral radiance of a laser at a single
frequency, so that the multi-photon absorption of few lines involves the whole
continuous spectrum; - a spherical shell containing large column densities of
excited atoms emits strongly super-radiant beams selected by competition of
modes; - the long paths in excited atoms allow observations which require in
the labs the use of ultrashort laser pulses. A necessary, qualitative update
watch that: - the whole continuous spectrum of the source pumps the atoms to
excited states, so that almost all energy emitted by the source is transferred
to a line spectrum; - the main fraction of this line spectrum is emitted by a
strong super-radiance in a spherical shell where the temperature becomes cold
enough for a notable de-ionization of the atoms; by competition of modes, a
dotted ring appears; - inside the ring, a less bright region emits
spontaneously lines made extremely broad by parametric transfers of energy
between the light beams and thermal radiation; the intensities of these lines
decrease down to zero, from increased laboratory frequencies to decreased
frequencies. Supernova remnant 1987A shows these properties.

is also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness
differences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate
the effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas. By studying
the mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to
fluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging 'edge of neutral
evolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our
results reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral
regimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory,
where defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our
studies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to
partly resolve social dilemmas. Our methods are generally applicable to
estimate the role of random drift in evolutionary dynamics.

of the 10um feature is investigated. We performed interferometric observations
in N band 8-13um with MIDI using baseline lengths of between 54m and 127m. The
data analysis is based on radiative-transfer simulations using the Monte Carlo
code MC3D by modeling simultaneously the SED, N band spectra, and
interferometric visibilities. Correlated and uncorrelated N band spectra are
compared to investigate the radial distribution of the dust composition of the
disk atmosphere. Spatially resolved mid-infrared emission was detected in all
objects. For four objects, the observed N band visibilities and corresponding
SEDs could be simultaneously simulated using a parameterized active disk-model.
For the more evolved objects of our sample, a purely passive disk-model
provides the closest fit. The visibilities inferred for one source allow the
presence of an inner disk gap. For another object, one of two visibility
measurements could not be simulated by our modeling approach. All uncorrelated
spectra reveal the 10um silicate emission feature. In contrast to this, some
correlated spectra of the observations of the more evolved objects do not show
this feature, indicating a lack of small silicates in the inner versus the
outer regions of these disks. We conclude from this observational result that
more evolved dust grains can be found in the more central disk regions.

onset of thermal convective instability in a rapidly rotating spherical shell.
They can also result from the destabilization of a Stewartson shear layer
produced by differential rotation as expected in the liquid sodium experiment
(DTS) working in Grenoble, France. A usual way to explain why Rossby waves can
participate to the dynamo process goes back to Busse (1975). In his picture,
the flow geometry is a cylindrical array of parallel rolls aligned with the
rotation axis. The axial flow component (the component parallel to the rotation
axis) is (i) maximum in the middle of each roll and changes its sign from one
roll to the next. It is produced by the Ekman pumping at the fluid containing
shell boundary. The corresponding dynamo mechanism can be explained in terms of
an $\alpha$-tensor with non-zero coefficients on the diagonal. In rapidly
rotating objects like the Earth's core (or in a fast rotating experiment),
Rossby waves occur in the limit of small Ekman number ($\approx 10^{-15}$). In
that case, the main source of the axial flow component is not the Ekman pumping
but rather the ``geometrical slope effect'' due to the spherical shape of the
fluid containing shell. This implies that the axial flow component is (ii)
maximum at the borders of the rolls and not at the centers. If assumed to be
stationary, such rolls would lead to zero coefficients on the diagonal of the
$\alpha$-tensor, making the dynamo probably less efficient if possible at all.
Actually, the rolls are drifting as a wave, and we show that this drift implies
non--zero coefficients on the diagonal of the $\alpha$-tensor. These new
coefficients are in essence very different from the ones obtained in case (i)
and cannot be interpreted in terms of the heuristic picture of Busse (1975).

to the non-negativity of the power spectrum of the underlying random process.
Specifically, for any statistically homogeneous and (for more than one spatial
dimension) isotropic random field with correlation function $\xi(x)$, we derive
inequalities for the correlation coefficients $r_n\equiv \xi(n x)/\xi(0)$ (for
integer $n$) of the form $r_{n{\rm l}}\le r_n\le r_{n{\rm u}}$, where the lower
and upper bounds on $r_n$ depend on the $r_j$, with $j<n$. Explicit expressions
for the bounds are obtained for arbitrary $n$. These constraint equations very
significantly limit the set of possible correlation functions. For one
particular example of a fiducial cosmic shear survey, we show that the Gaussian
likelihood ellipsoid has a significant spill-over into the forbidden region of
correlation functions, rendering the resulting best-fitting model parameters
and their error region questionable, and indicating the need for a better
description of the likelihood function.
  We conduct some simple numerical experiments which explicitly demonstrate the
failure of a Gaussian description for the likelihood of $\xi$. Instead, the
shape of the likelihood function of the correlation coefficients appears to
follow approximately that of the shape of the bounds on the $r_n$, even if the
Gaussian ellipsoid lies well within the allowed region.
  For more than one spatial dimension of the random field, the explicit
expressions of the bounds on the $r_n$ are not optimal. We outline a
geometrical method how tighter bounds may be obtained in principle. We
illustrate this method for a few simple cases; a more general treatment awaits
future work.

PCA data allows for studying the complete spectral evolution along the
horizontal, normal and flaring branches of the Z-track. Comparison with
previous study show that the details of spectral evolution (like variation of
Comptonizing electron temperature), is similar to that of GX 17+2 but unlike
that of Cyg X-2 and GX 349+2. This suggests that Z sources are heterogeneous
group with perhaps LMC X-2 and GX 17+2 being member of a subclass. However non
monotonic evolution of the Compton y-parameter seems to be generic to all
sources. The broad band {\it Suzaku} data reveals that the additional soft
component of the source modelled as a disk blackbody emission is strongly
preferred over one where it is taken to be a blackbody spectrum. This component
as well as the temperature of seed photons do not vary when source goes into a
flaring mode and the entire variation can be ascribed to the Comptonizing
cloud. The bolometric unabsorbed luminosity of the source is well constrained
to be $ \sim 2.23 \times 10^{38}$ ergs/sec which if the source is Eddington
limited implies a neutron star mass of 1.6 M$_\odot$. We discuss the

SWIFT J1753.5-0127 and GX 339-4 show evidence for accretion disc blackbody
emission, in addition to hard power-laws. The soft and hard band Power-Spectral
Densities (PSDs) of these sources demonstrate variability over a wide range of
time-scales. However, on time-scales of tens of seconds, corresponding to the
putative low-frequency Lorentzian in the PSD, there is additional power in the
soft band. To interpret this behaviour, we introduce a new spectral analysis
technique, the `covariance spectrum', to disentangle the contribution of the
X-ray spectral components to variations on different time-scales. We use this
technique to show that the disc blackbody component varies on all time-scales,
but varies more, relative to the power-law, on longer time-scales. This
behaviour explains the additional long-term variability seen in the soft band.
Comparison of the blackbody and iron line normalisations seen in the covariance
spectra in GX 339-4 implies that the short-term blackbody variations are driven
by thermal reprocessing of the power-law continuum absorbed by the disc.
However, since the amplitude of variable reflection is the same on long and
short time-scales, we rule out reprocessing as the cause of the enhanced disc
variability on long time-scales. Therefore we conclude that the long-time-scale
blackbody variations are caused by instabilities in the disc itself, in
contrast to the stable discs seen in BHXRB soft states. Our results provide the
first observational evidence that the low-frequency Lorentzian feature present
in the PSD is produced by the accretion disc.

relativistic electrons and supports a turbulent acceleration scenario. At that
time, due to the steep spectrum, the available observations at 1.4 GHz
(archival NRAO - Very Large Array - VLA CnB-configuration data) were not
adequate to accurately determine the flux density associated with the radio
halo. In this paper we report the detection at 1.4 GHz of the radio halo in
Abell 521 using deep VLA observations in the D-configuration. We use these new
data to confirm the steep-spectrum of the object. We consider Abell 521 the
prototype of a population of very-steep spectrum halos. This population is
predicted assuming that turbulence plays an important role in the acceleration
of relativistic particles in galaxy clusters, and we expect it will be unveiled

order oscillators which have the original number of degrees of freedom. Such
extension is provided by adding a total time derivative to the PU Lagrangian
together with a complexification of the original variables further subjected to
reality conditions in order to maintain the required number of degrees of

Remarkably, at the quantum level the negative norm states are eliminated, as
well as the problems of unbounded below energy and non-unitary time evolution.
We illustrate the idea of our approach by eliminating the negative norm states
in a complex oscillator. Next, we extend the procedure to the Pais-Uhlenbeck

transition occurs at some finite value of the infection rate and the
corresponding dynamical critical exponents depend on the underlying network.

agreement with the discrete scale invariance of the networks. In case of
spreading from an initial active seed, the critical exponents are found to
depend on the location of the initial seed and break the hyper-scaling law of
the directed percolation universality class due to the inhomogeneity of the

thermodynamic variables are temperature and liquid composition. In the first
step, one isobaric isothermal simulation for the liquid phase is performed, in
which the chemical potentials of all components and their derivatives with
respect to the pressure, i.e., the partial molar volumes, are calculated. From
these results, first order Taylor series expansions for the chemical potentials
as functions of the pressure $\mu_i(p)$ at constant liquid composition are
determined. That information is needed, as the specified pressure in the liquid
will generally not be equal to the equilibrium pressure, which has to be found
in the course of a vapour simulation. In the second step, one pseudo grand
canonical simulation for the vapour phase is performed, where the chemical
potentials are set according to the instantaneous pressure $p^v$ using the
previously determined function $\mu_i(p^v)$. In this way, results for the
vapour pressure and vapour composition are achieved which are consistent to the
given temperature and liquid composition.The new method is applied to the pure
Lennard-Jones fluid, a binary, and a ternary mixture of Lennard-Jones spheres

we show that the source spectrum is well-described as the emission of an
extended accretion disk corona, plus a small contribution of blackbody emission
from the neutron star. The dip spectrum is well-fitted by the progressive
covering model in which the extended ADC is progressively overlapped by the
absorbing bulge of low ionization state in the outer accretion disk and that
dipping is basically due to photoelectric absorption in the bulge. An
energy-independent decrease of flux at high energies (20 - 70 keV) is shown to
be consistent with the level of Thomson scattering expected in the bulge. An
absorption feature at 6.67 keV (Fe XXV) is detected in the non-dip spectrum and
other possible weak features. In dipping, absorption lines of medium and highly
ionized states are seen suggestive of absorption in the ADC but there is no
evidence that the lines are stronger than in non-dip. We show that the
luminosity of the source has changed substantially since the Exosat observation
of 1985, increasing in luminosity between 1985 and 2003, then in 2003 - 2007
falling to the initial low value. X-ray bursting has again become periodic,
which it ceased to do in its highest luminosity state, and we find that the
X-ray bursts exhibit both the fast decay and later slow decay characteristic of
the rp burning process. We present arguments against the recent proposal that
the decrease of continuum flux in the dipping LMXB in general can be explained
as absorption in an ionized absorber rather than in the bulge in the outer disk

weak decay channel of $p$-shell $\Lambda$-hypernuclei. Negatively charged pion
spectra from mesonic decay were measured with magnetic analysis for the first
time for ${^{7}_{\Lambda}Li}$, ${^{9}_{\Lambda}Be}$, ${^{11}_{\Lambda}B}$ and
${^{15}_{\Lambda}N}$. The shape of the $\pi^{-}$ spectra was interpreted
through a comparison with pion distorted wave calculations that take into
account the structure of both hypernucleus and daughter nucleus. Branching
ratios $\Gamma_{\pi^{-}}/\Gamma_{tot}$ were derived from the measured spectra
and converted to $\pi^{-}$ decay rates $\Gamma_{\pi^{-}}$ by means of known or
extrapolated total decay widths $\Gamma_{tot}$ of $p$-shell
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei. Based on these measurements, the spin-parity assignment
$1/2^+$ for ${^{7}_{\Lambda}Li}$ and $5/2^+$ for ${^{11}_{\Lambda}B}$

  S. Saunders, J. Barrett, A. Kent and D. Wallace (eds), Oxford University
  Press, 2010",,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a compelling intellectual case for exploring whether purely unitary
quantum theory defines a sensible and scientifically adequate theory, as
Everett originally proposed. Many different and incompatible attempts to define
a coherent Everettian quantum theory have been made over the past fifty years.
However, no known version of the theory (unadorned by extra ad hoc postulates)
can account for the appearance of probabilities and explain why the theory it
was meant to replace, Copenhagen quantum theory, appears to be confirmed, or
more generally why our evolutionary history appears to be Born-rule typical.
This article reviews some ingenious and interesting recent attempts in this
direction by Wallace, Greaves, Myrvold and others, and explains why they don't
work. An account of one-world randomness, which appears scientifically
satisfactory, and has no many-worlds analogue, is proposed. A fundamental
obstacle to confirming many-worlds theories is illustrated by considering some
toy many-worlds models. These models show that branch weights can exist without
having any role in either rational decision-making or theory confirmation, and
also that the latter two roles are logically separate. Wallace's proposed
decision theoretic axioms for rational agents in a multiverse and claimed
derivation of the Born rule are examined. It is argued that Wallace's strategy
of axiomatizing a mathematically precise decision theory within a fuzzy
Everettian quasiclassical ontology is incoherent. Moreover, Wallace's axioms
are not constitutive of rationality either in Everettian quantum theory or in
theories in which branchings and branch weights are precisely defined. In both
cases, there exist coherent rational strategies that violate some of the
axioms.

Bright scattered light nebulosity is observed towards this source in the Ks
images, that seems to trace the edges of an outflow cavity. We report the
detection of a low-luminosity protostar 2M17112255-27243448 (2M17112255) that
lies 8"" (~1000 AU) from 2M171123. This is a Class I system, as indicated by its
2-8 micron slope and IRAC colors, with an estimated internal luminosity of
~0.3Lsun. We estimate a mass of ~0.12-0.25 Msun for this source, at an age of
0.1-1Myr. Also presented is detailed modeling of the 2M171123 system. The
best-fit parameters indicate a large envelope density of the order of ~10^(-13)
g cm^(-3), and an intermediate inclination between 53 and 59deg. The observed
Ks-band variability for this system could be explained by slight variability in
the mass infall rate between 2.5E-5 and 1.8E-5 Msun/yr. The protostar 2M171123
exhibits a rarely observed absorption feature near 11.3 micron within its 10
micron silicate band. We find a strong correlation between the strength in this
11.3 micron 'edge' and the H2O-ice column density, indicating the origin of
this feature in the thickness of the ice mantle over the silicate grains.

carried out in 2007-2008. The pole position was refined to lambda0 =
199.5+/-0.5 eg and beta0 = 39.8+/-5 deg in J2000 ecliptic coordinates, leaving
intact the physical solution for the components, assimilated to two perfect
Roche ellipsoids, and derived after the 2005 mutual event season (Descamps et
al., 2007). Furthermore, a large-scale geological depression, located on one of
the components, was introduced to better match the observed lightcurves. This
vast geological feature of about 68 km in diameter, which could be postulated
as a bowl-shaped impact crater, is indeed responsible of the photometric
asymmetries seen on the ""shoulders"" of the lightcurves. The bulk density was
then recomputed to 1.28+/-0.04 gcm-3 to take into account this large-scale
non-convexity. This giant crater could be the aftermath of a tremendous
collision of a 100-km sized proto-Antiope with another Themis family member.
This statement is supported by the fact that Antiope is sufficiently porous
(~50%) to survive such an impact without being wholly destroyed. This violent
shock would have then imparted enough angular momentum for fissioning of
proto-Antiope into two equisized bodies. We calculated that the impactor must
have a diameter greater than ~17 km, for an impact velocity ranging between 1
and 4 km/s. With such a projectile, this event has a substantial 50%
probability to have occurred over the age of the Themis family.

violation these monopoles acquire an electric charge in the hidden sector due
to the Witten effect. We show that quite generally they also acquire (small)
electric charges under the visible electromagnetic gauge group. This is a
result of ""magnetic mixing"" which, as we show, often arises as a natural
partner of kinetic mixing. Both kinetic and magnetic mixing are naturally
induced radiatively even if the low-energy U(1)s arise from a single
