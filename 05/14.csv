alpha-element enhanced abundances. The SSP models are based on the Dartmouth
Stellar Evolution Database, our library of synthetic stellar spectra, and a
detailed systematic variation of horizontal-branch (HB) morphology with age and
metallicity. In order to test the relative importance of a variety of SSP model
ingredients, we compare our SSP models with integrated spectra of 41 Milky Way
Globular Clusters (MWGCs) from Schiavon et al. (2005). Using the Mg b and
Ca4227 indices, we confirm that Mg and Ca are enhanced by about +0.4 and +0.2
dex, respectively, in agreement with results from high resolution spectra of
individual stars in MWGCs. Balmer lines, particularly Hgamma and Hdelta, of
MWGCs are reproduced by our alpha-enhanced SSP models not only because of the
combination of isochrone and spectral effects but also because of our
reasonable HB treatment. Moreover, it is shown that the Mg abundance
significantly influences Balmer and iron line indices. Finally, the
investigation of power-law initial mass function (IMF) variations suggests that
an IMF much shallower than Salpeter is unrealistic because the Balmer lines are
too strong on the metal-poor side to be compatible with observations.

brane models on an orientifold. The classification of all solutions for the
widely-studied T^6/Z_2 x Z_2 orientifold is made possible by computing all
combinations of branes with negative tadpole contributions. This provides the
necessary information to systematically and efficiently identify all models in
this class with specific characteristics. In particular, all ways in which a
desired group G can be realized by a system of intersecting branes can be
enumerated in polynomial time. We identify all distinct brane realizations of
the gauge groups SU(3) x SU(2) and SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) which can be embedded
in any model which is compatible with the tadpole and SUSY constraints. We
compute the distribution of the number of generations of ""quarks"" and find that
3 is neither suppressed nor particularly enhanced compared to other odd
generation numbers. The overall distribution of models is found to have a long
tail. Despite disproportionate suppression of models in the tail by K-theory

$v_{s}$ of plane waves propagating in a strongly magnetized quark-gluon plasma
(QGP), a chiral magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) description of a perfect

is developed using the effective action of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model
of QCD at finite temperature, finite baryon chemical potential and in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. Here, the D$\chi$SB arises due to the
phenomenon of magnetic catalysis. Apart from an interesting frequency
dependence, for plane waves propagating in the transverse or longitudinal
direction with respect to the $B$ field, the sound velocity is anisotropic and
depends on the angle between the corresponding wave vectors and the direction
of the $B$ field. Moreover, for plane waves propagating in the transverse
(longitudinal) direction to the external $B$ field, the sound velocity has a
maximum (minimum) at $T<T_{c}$, reaches a local minimum (maximum) at $T\sim
T_{c}$ and remains constant at $T\gtrsim T_{c}$. Here, $T_{c}$ is the critical
temperature of the chiral phase transition. Thus, the constant value $v_{s}\sim
1.5 c_{s}$ at $T \gtrsim T_{c}$ turns out to be a lower (upper) bound for waves
propagating in the transverse (longitudinal) direction with respect to the

separations < 10^2 AU are not significantly modified in any cluster, therefore
at these separations the field reflects the sum of all star formation. Binaries
with separations in the range 10^2 - 10^4 AU are progressively more and more
heavily affected by dynamical disruption in increasingly dense clusters. If
most star formation is clustered, these binaries must be over-produced relative
to the field. Finally, no binary with a separation > 10^4 AU can survive in any
cluster and so must be produced by isolated star formation, but only if all

$d$ the dimension of the space $\Omega_d$ (e.g. for $\mathbb{R}^d$ the
dimension is just the usual one) and we allow the size of the dataset $n=n_d$
to be such that $d$ is superlogarithmic but subpolynomial in $n$.
  We study the asymptotic performance of pivot-based indexing schemes where the
number of pivots is $o(n/d)$. We pick the relatively simple cost model of
similarity search where we count each distance calculation as a single
computation and disregard the rest.
  We demonstrate that if the spaces $\Omega_d$ exhibit the (fairly common)
concentration of measure phenomenon the performance of similarity search using
such indexes is asymptotically linear in $n$. That is for large enough $d$ the
difference between using such an index and performing a search without an index
at all is negligeable. Thus we confirm the curse of dimensionality in this
setting.

IRAC and MIPS on Spitzer and with MSX. We use color-color diagrams and SED fits
to explore the nature of YSO candidates (including objects with 4.5 micron
excesses possibly due to molecular emission). There is an asymmetry in the
distribution of the candidate YSOs, which tend to be found at negative Galactic
longitudes; this behavior contrasts with that of the molecular gas,
approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes. The small scale height of
these objects suggests that they are within the Galactic center region and are
dynamically young. They lie between two layers of infrared dark clouds and may
have originated from these clouds. We identify new sites for this recent star
formation. The methanol masers appear to be associated with young, embedded
YSOs characterized by 4.5 micron excesses. We use the SEDs of these sources to
estimate their physical characteristics. Within the central 400x50 pc
(|l|<1.3\degr and |b|<10') the star formation rate based on the identification
of Stage I evolutionary phase of YSO candidates is about 0.14 solar mass/yr. We
suggest that a recent burst of star formation took place within the last 10^5
years. This suggestion is also consistent with estimates of star formation
rates within the last ~10^7 years showing a peak around 10^5 years ago. Lastly,
we find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt Law applies well in the central 400 pc of
the Galaxy. This implies that star formation does not appear to be dramatically
affected by the extreme physical conditions in the Galactic center region.

case-control studies, but the literature on the theoretical aspects of the
resulting estimates is scarce. We bring our contribution to this literature by
studying estimators obtained via L1 penalized likelihood optimization. We show
that the optimizers of the L1 penalized retrospective likelihood coincide with
the optimizers of the L1 penalized prospective likelihood. This extends the
results of Prentice and Pyke (1979), obtained for non-regularized likelihoods.
We establish both the sup-norm consistency of the odds ratio, after model
selection, and the consistency of subset selection of our estimators. The
novelty of our theoretical results consists in the study of these properties
under the case-control sampling scheme. Our results hold for selection
performed over a large collection of candidate variables, with cardinality
allowed to depend and be greater than the sample size. We complement our
theoretical results with a novel approach of determining data driven tuning
parameters, based on the bisection method. The resulting procedure offers
significant computational savings when compared with grid search based methods.
All our numerical experiments support strongly our theoretical findings.

tilted more than three degrees for negative superhumps to be statistically
significant. We also show that if the disc is tilted enough such that the gas
stream strikes a disc face, then a dense cooling ring is generated near the

  In addition to the atlas, we study these artificially tilted accretion discs

propagating solitonic structures, is found to play a major role in promoting
in-registry commensurate regions beneficial to this quantized sliding. By
evaluating the force instantaneously exerted on the top plate, we find that
this quantized sliding represents a dynamical ``pinned'' state, characterized
by significantly low values of the kinetic friction. While the quantized
sliding occurs due to solitons being driven gently, the transition to ordinary
unpinned sliding regimes can involve lubricant melting due to large
shear-induced Joule heating, for example at large speed.

multi-phase model, with the dominant dissipation due to cloud collisions. The
Schmidt-Kennicutt law emerges naturally for star-forming disks and starbursts.
We predict that there should be an inverse correlation between Tully-Fisher law
and Schmidt-Kennicutt law residuals. The model is extended to include a
multi-phase treatment of supernova feedback that leads to a turbulent
pressure-regulated generalization of the star formation law and is applicable
to gas-rich starbursts. Enhanced pressure, as expected in merger-induced star
formation, enhances star formation efficiency. An upper limit is derived for
the disk star formation rate in starbursts that depends on the ratio of global
ISM to cloud pressures. We extend these considerations to the case where the
interstellar gas pressure in the inner galaxy is dominated by outflows from a
central AGN. During massive spheroid formation, AGN-driven winds trigger star
formation, resulting in enhanced supernova feedback and outflows. The outflows
are comparable to the AGN-boosted star formation rate and saturate in the
super-Eddington limit. Downsizing of both SMBH and spheroids is a consequence
of AGN-driven positive feedback. Bondi accretion feeds the central black hole
with a specific accretion rate that is proportional to the black hole mass.
AGN-enhanced star formation is mediated by turbulent pressure and relates
spheroid star formation rate to black hole accretion rate. The relation between
black hole mass and spheroid velocity dispersion has a coefficient (Salpeter
time to gas consumption time ratio) that provides an arrow of time. Highly
efficient, AGN-boosted star formation can occur at high redshift.

scaled-up analogs to local ULIRGs. We utilize these models to investigate the

taken when applying standard techniques. The usage of CO line widths as a
dynamical mass estimator from SMGs can possibly overestimate the true enclosed

from CO J=3-2 (and higher lying lines) to CO (J=1-0) will oftentimes lead to
underestimates of the inferred gas mass. We provide tests for these models by

further explore mechanisms responsible for their formation and show that a

the surrounding halo gas, are not able to connect directly to galaxies, as they
do at high redshift, but are instead susceptible to the combined action of
cooling and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at intermediate radii within the halo
leading to the production of cold, dense pressure-confined clouds, without an
associated dark matter component. This process is aided through the compression
of the incoming filaments by the hot halo gas and expanding shocks during the
halo buildup. Our mechanism directly seeds clouds from gas with substantial
local overdensity, unlike in previous models, and provides a channel for the
origin of cloud complexes. These clouds can later ""rain"" onto galaxies,
delivering fuel for star formation. Owing to the relatively large cross section

Relativity in five-dimensional spacetime may indeed emerge at a special

and corresponding ""anomalous"" Gauss-Bonnet constraints drop out from the

locally principal closed subschemes. Our main tools are the stratifications by
Hilbert-Samuel functions and the characteristic polyhedra introduced by H.
Hironaka. In an appendix we show that the standard method used in
characteristic zero - the theory of maximal contact - does not work for
surfaces in positive characteristic (the counterexamples are hypersurfaces in
affine threespace and work over any field of positive characteristic).
  In this new version, we treat the case of locally noetherian but not
necessarily noetherian schemes in an appropriate way. Here one does not have a
finite resolution sequence, but still a canonical resolution morphism by
glueing. The same techniques allow to treat algebraic spaces and stacks.

transitions. They can define quantitative languages $L$ that assign to each
word $w$ a real number $L(w)$. In the case of infinite words, the value of a
run is naturally computed as the maximum, limsup, liminf, limit average, or
discounted sum of the transition weights. We study expressiveness and closure
questions about these quantitative languages.
  We first show that the set of words with value greater than a threshold can
be non-$\omega$-regular for deterministic limit-average and discounted-sum
automata, while this set is always $\omega$-regular when the threshold is
isolated (i.e., some neighborhood around the threshold contains no word). In
the latter case, we prove that the $\omega$-regular language is robust against
small perturbations of the transition weights.
  We next consider automata with transition weights 0 or 1 and show that they
are as expressive as general weighted automata in the limit-average case, but
not in the discounted-sum case.
  Third, for quantitative languages $L_1$ and $L_2$, we consider the operations
$\max(L_1,L_2)$, $\min(L_1,L_2)$, and $1-L_1$, which generalize the boolean
operations on languages, as well as the sum $L_1 + L_2$. We establish the

the intra-cluster medium (ICM) turbulence during the cluster formation process.
The ICM turbulence is shown to be generated and sustained by the frequent

to exist in the ICM and amplify the magnetic field energy and flux. The total
magnetic energy in the cluster can reach $\sim$ $10^{61}$ ergs while micro
Gauss ($\mu$G) fields can distribute over $\sim$ Mpc scales throughout the

theoretical result is that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the sheaf of

are the maximal codimension, dimension, and degree, respectively, of all

hyperplane sections in $X$, the algebraic de Rham cohomology of $X\setminus V$
is described by differential forms with poles along $V$ of single exponential
order. This yields a similar description of the de Rham cohomology of $X$,
which allows its efficient computation. Furthermore, we give a parallel

$P$, the transition temperature and the upper critical field of the low field
SC decrease slightly, while the RSC dome drastically shifts to higher fields
and shrinks. The spin reorientation field $H_{\rm R}$ also increases. At a
pressure $P\sim 1.8$ GPa, the RSC has collapsed while the low field SC persists
and may disappear only above 4 GPa. Via careful $(P, H)$ studies of the

properties of complex networks, which are usually used to evaluate the
robustness of a network. Recently, much work has been devoted to determining
the network design with optimal robustness. However, little attention has been
paid to the problem of how to improve the robustness of existing networks. In
this paper, we present a new parameter alpha, called enforcing parameter, to
guide the process of enhancing the robustness of scale-free networks by
gradually adding new links. Intuitively, alpha < 0 means the nodes with lower
degrees are selected preferentially while the nodes with higher degrees will be
more probably selected when alpha > 0. It is shown both theoretically and
experimentally that when alpha < 0 the attack survivability of the network can
be enforced apparently. Then we propose new strategies to enhance the network
robustness. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we conclude that
establishing new links between nodes with low degrees can drastically enforce
the attack survivability of scale-free networks while having little impact on
the error tolerance.

ultimately require us to dismiss commonsense so-called macroscopic reality.
Leggett and Garg applied the Bell scheme for testing local realism to the time
evolution of a macroscopic two-state system, and proposed a temporal version of
the Bell inequality (the Leggett-Garg (LG) inequality) for testing macroscopic
realism. However, as with the Bell inequality, the statistical approach behind
this scheme may be less effective in showing clear incompatibility. Here we
propose a temporal version of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) scheme

strong gravitational lensing induced by the foreground supercluster, finding

of its degree distribution is 1.2, which is much smaller than that of the IPv4

collapse of initial states for which the gas is at rest and everywhere
overdense from its corresponding hydrostatic equilibrium profile by a factor
$\Lambda$, and apply our results toward the analysis of star formation within
dense, elongated molecular cores. An important aspect of this work is the
determination of the mass infall rates over a range of the parameters which
define the overall state of the gas -- the overdensity parameter $\Lambda$, the
index $\Gamma$ of the static equation of state, and the index $\gamma$ of the
dynamic equation of state. While most of the parameter space explored in this
work leads to solutions for which the underlying equations do not become

waves within the Charney-Hasegawa-Mima (CHM) model both theoretically, using
truncated (four-mode and three-mode) models, and numerically, using direct
simulations of CHM equation in the Fourier space. The linear theory predicts
instability for any amplitude of the primary wave. For strong primary waves the
most unstable modes are perpendicular to the primary wave, which correspond to
generation of a zonal flow if the primary wave is purely meridional. For weaker
waves, the maximum growth occurs for off-zonal inclined modulations. For very
weak primary waves the unstable waves are close to being in three-wave
resonance with the primary wave. The nonlinear theory predicts that the zonal
flows generated by the linear instability experience pinching into narrow zonal
jets. Our numerical simulations confirm the theoretical predictions of the
linear theory as well as of the nonlinear pinching. We find that, for strong
primary waves, these narrow zonal jets further roll up into Karman-like vortex
streets. On the other hand, for weak primary waves, the growth of the unstable
mode reverses and the system oscillates between a dominant jet and a dominate
primary wave. The 2D vortex streets appear to be more stable than purely 1D
zonal jets, and their zonal-averaged speed can reach amplitudes much stronger
than is allowed by the Rayleigh-Kuo instability criterion for the 1D case. We
find that the truncation models work well for both the linear stage and and
often even for the medium-term nonlinear behavior. In the long term, the system
transitions to turbulence helped by the vortex-pairing instability (for strong
waves) and by the resonant wave-wave interactions (for weak waves).

fields. For this purpose, we calculate baryon and dark matter (DM) dynamics in
spherical symmetry, incorporating the self-shielding effects by solving the
radiative transfer of UV radiation. In addition, we prescribe the star
formation in cooled gas components and pursue the dynamics of formed stars. As
a result, we find that the evolution of subgalactic objects in UV background
radiation are separated into three types, that is, (1) prompt star formation,
where less massive clouds ~10^{5-8} M_sun are promptly self-shielded and
undergo star formation, (2) delayed star formation, where photoionized massive
clouds >10^8 M_sun collapse despite high thermal pressure and are eventually
self-shielded to form stars in a delayed fashion, and (3) supersonic infall,
where photoionized less massive clouds ~10^{5-8} M_sun contract with supersonic
infall velocity and are self-shielded when a compact core forms. In particular,
the type (3) is a novel type found in the present simulations, and eventually
produces a very compact star cluster. The resultant mass-to-light ratios,
half-mass radii, and velocity dispersions for the three types are compared to
the observations of GCs, dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and ultra-compact dwarfs
(UCDs). It turns out that the properties of star clusters resulting from
supersonic infall match well with those of observed GCs, whereas the other two
types are distinct from GCs. Hence, we conclude that supersonic infall in a UV
background is a promising mechanism to form GCs.

Our results show that the replacement of an alkaline earth metal (Sr - Ba) and
4d metal (Ru - Rh) leads to various types of anisotropic deformations of the
crystal structure caused by strong anisotropy of inter-atomic bonds.
  The band structure, density of states and Fermi surfaces have been evaluated
and discussed. Appreciable changes in the near-Fermi bands and the Fermi
surface topology found as going from (Sr,Ba)Ru2As2 to (Sr,Ba)Rh2As2 reflect the
growth of the 3D-like type of dispersion for these systems, which is
accompanied by an increase in the near-Fermi density of states. The
inter-atomic bonding in (Sr,Ba)(Ru,Rh)2As2 phases adopts a complex anisotropic
character, where the bonding in [(Ru,Rh)2As2] blocks is of a mixed
metallic-ionic-covalent type whereas between adjacent [(Ru,Rh)2As2] blocks and
(Sr,Ba) atomic sheets, ionic interactions emerge; thus these systems may be
classified as ionic metals.

to reveal the relation between isopedic magnetic fields and dark matter halo in
spiral galaxies with globally stationary perturbation configurations. Our
results show that, fairly strong yet realistic magnetic fields require a
considerably larger amount of dark matter in aligned and unaligned cases than
weak or moderate magnetic field strengths. We discuss astrophysical and

should be maintained in the course of time on large scales. By examining the
scale-dependence of the pattern in different redshift intervals it is possible
to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe, and thus to measure the
cosmological parameters governing the expansion of the universe. The features
in the galaxy distribution that can be used as standard rulers include the
topology of large-scale structure and the overall shapes of galaxy power
spectrum and correlation function. The genus, being an intrinsic topology
measure, is resistant against the non-linear gravitational evolution, galaxy
biasing, and redshift-space distortion effects, and thus is ideal for
quantifying the primordial topology of the large-scale structure. The expansion
history of the universe can be constrained by comparing among the genus
measured at different redshifts. In the case of initially Gaussian fluctuations
the genus accurately recovers the slope of the primordial power spectrum near
the smoothing scale, and the expansion history can be constrained by comparing
between the predicted and measured genus.

based on the lattice of closed linear subspaces of some Hilbert space, or, more
generally, on the lattice of projections in a von Neumann algebra A.
Unfortunately, the logical interpretation of these lattices is impaired by
their nondistributivity and by various other problems. We show that a possible
resolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if
instead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be
families of projections indexed by a partially ordered set C(A) of appropriate
commutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and
ease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart
C*-algebra and that C(A) consists of all unital commutative Rickart
C*-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a
natural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic:
distributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle.
  Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n-by-n matrices, we
prove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the
internal Gelfand spectrum (in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey) of the
""Bohrification"" of A, which is a commutative Rickart C*-algebra in the topos of
functors from C(A) to the category of sets. We explain the relationship of this
construction to partial Boolean algebras and Bruns-Lakser completions. Finally,
we establish a connection between probability measure on the lattice of
projections on a Hilbert space H and probability valuations on the internal
Gelfand spectrum of A for A = B(H).

defined by a nonlinear threshold $\delta=200$ this corresponds to using a
linear threshold $\delta_L\simeq 1.59$ instead of the traditional value $\simeq
1.686$. We also provide a fitting formula that matches simulations over all
mass scales and obeys the exact large-mass tail. Next, paying attention to the
Lagrangian-Eulerian mapping (i.e. corrections associated with the motions of
halos), we improve the standard analytical formula for the bias of massive
halos. We check that our prediction, which contains no free parameter, agrees
reasonably well with numerical simulations. In particular, it recovers the
steepening of the dependence on scale of the bias that is observed at higher
redshifts, which published fitting formulae did not capture. This behavior
mostly arises from nonlinear biasing.

example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not
allow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be
stronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be
transmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do
not single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share
such traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum
correlations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It
states that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown
to him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be
correlated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is
bounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if
Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains
to her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to
the standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is
respected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all
the no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum
correlations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob
access to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit
is sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the
value of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We
suggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be
one of the foundational properties of Nature.

associated to a pressure pulse specified in the lower-lying regions.
  The normal mode analysis shows that the entire cylindrical cavity of granular
dimensions tends to oscillate with frequencies of 5-8 mHz and also with the
atmospheric cut-off frequency. Furthermore, the passage of a pressure pulse,
excited in the convection zone, sets up a wake in the cavity oscillating with
the same cut-off frequency. The wake oscillations can resonate with the free
oscillation modes, which leads to an enhanced observed oscillation power.

These excitations, called surfons, appear because helium atoms have discrete
energy level at the liquid surface, being attracted to the surface by the van
der Waals force and repulsed at a hard-core interatomic distance. The
concentration of the surfons increases with temperature. The surfons propagate
along the surface and form a two-dimensional gas. Basing on the simple model of
the surfon microscopic structure, we estimate the surfon activation energy and
effective mass for both helium isotopes. We also calculate the contribution of
the surfons to the temperature dependence of the surface tension. This
contribution explains the great and long-standing discrepancy between theory
and experiment on this temperature dependence in both helium isotopes. The
achieved agreement between our theory and experiment is extremely high. The
comparison with experiment allows to extract the surfon activation energy and
effective mass. The values of these surfon microscopic parameters are in a
reasonable agreement with the calculated from the proposed simple model of

of the 80's after a paper of V.D. Goppa. Given a smooth projective algebraic
curve X over a finite field, there are two different constructions of
error-correcting codes. The first one, called ""functional"", uses some rational
functions on X and the second one, called ""differential"", involves some
rational 1-forms on this curve. Hundreds of papers are devoted to the study of
such codes.
  In addition, a generalization of the functional construction for algebraic
varieties of arbitrary dimension is given by Y. Manin in an article of 1984. A
few papers about such codes has been published, but nothing has been done
concerning a generalization of the differential construction to the
higher-dimensional case.
  In this thesis, we propose a differential construction of codes on algebraic
surfaces. Afterwards, we study the properties of these codes and particularly
their relations with functional codes. A pretty surprising fact is that a main
difference with the case of curves appears. Indeed, if in the case of curves, a
differential code is always the orthogonal of a functional one, this assertion
generally fails for surfaces. Last observation motivates the study of codes
which are the orthogonal of some functional code on a surface. Therefore, we
prove that, under some condition on the surface, these codes can be realized as
sums of differential codes. Moreover, we show that some answers to some open
problems ""a la Bertini"" could give very interesting informations on the
parameters of these codes.

standard model (SM) quarks to the SM gauge bosons W and Z and to the SM Higgs
boson H. Integrating out these fermions at tree level we derive general
formulae that can be used in any model containing such particles. We apply
these formulae to the case of the lightest Kaluza-Klein (KK) fermions in a
Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with a custodial protection of flavour conserving
$Zd_L^i d_L^i$ and flavour violating $Zd_L^i d_L^j$ couplings. We point out
that in this model also the couplings of $Zu_R^i u_R^i$ and $Zu_R^i u_R^j$ are
protected. In particular we demonstrate explicitly that this protection is not
spoiled by the mixing of the SM quarks with the KK fermions, which is
guaranteed by the underlying P_LR symmetry. We find that the impact of KK
fermions on the Z-couplings, while not negligible, is significantly smaller
than the one coming from the mixing of Z with the heavy KK gauge bosons Z_H and
Z'.The situation is similar for the W couplings with the only exception of the
tb coupling where the impact of KK fermions can in principle be larger than the
effects that are induced by gauge boson mixing. We also show explicitly that at
O(v^2/M_{KK}^2) the fermion-Higgs couplings of a Higgs placed on the infrared
(IR) brane is not affected by the KK contributions up to strongly chirally
suppressed contributions. The corrections to the CKM matrix, in particular the
breakdown of its unitarity, are found to be small. We also investigate the
right-handed couplings of W that are generated through the mixing with
KK-fermions and introduce a 3x3 matrix that describes the pattern of flavour
violation in these new interactions of the standard W.

to lysis in bacteriophage lambda presents a unique challenge to quantitative
modeling. Despite extensive characterization of this regulatory network, the
origin of the extreme stability of the lysogenic state remains unclear. We have
constructed a stochastic model for this switch. Using Forward Flux Sampling
simulations, we show that this model predicts an extremely low rate of
spontaneous prophage induction in a recA mutant, in agreement with experimental
observations. In our model, the DNA loop formed by octamerization of CI bound
to the O_L and O_R operator regions is crucial for stability, allowing the
lysogenic state to remain stable even when a large fraction of the total CI is
depleted by nonspecific binding to genomic DNA. DNA looping also ensures that
the switch is robust to mutations in the order of the O_R binding sites. Our
results suggest that DNA looping can provide a mechanism to maintain a stable
lysogenic state in the face of a range of challenges including noisy gene
expression, nonspecific DNA binding and operator site mutations.

that the experiment constitutes a ""dynamical"" observation of the phase

validate the absence of system hazards concerning dysfunctional interactions,
industrials call for approaches of modeling system safety requirements and
interaction constraints among components and with environments (e.g., between
humans and machines). This paper proposes a framework based on input/output
constraint meta-automata, which restricts system behavior at the meta level.
This approach can formally model safe interactions between a system and its
environment or among its components. This framework differs from the framework
of the traditional model checking. It explicitly separates the tasks of product
engineers and safety engineers, and provides a top-down technique for modeling
a system with safety constraints, and for automatically composing a safe system
that conforms to safety requirements. The contributions of this work include
formalizing system safety requirements and a way of automatically ensuring
system safety.

in Keplerian rotation. Be star/X-ray binary systems contain a Be star and a
neutron star. They are found to have non-zero eccentricities and there is
evidence that some systems have a misalignment between the spin axis of the
star and the spin axis of the binary orbit. The eccentricities in these systems
are thought to be caused by a kick to the neutron star during the supernova
that formed it. Such kicks would also give rise to misalignments. In this paper
we investigate the extent to which the same kick distribution can give rise to
both the observed eccentricity distribution and the observed misalignments. We
find that a Maxwellian distribution of velocity kicks with a low velocity
dispersion, $\sigma_k \approx 15\rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observed
eccentricity distribution but is hard to reconcile with the observed
misalignments, typically $i \ge 25^\circ$. Alternatively a higher velocity kick
distribution, $\sigma_k = 265 \rm km s^{-1}$, is consistent with the observed
misalignments but not with the observed eccentricities, unless post-supernova
circularisation of the binary orbits has taken place. We discuss briefly how
this might be achieved.

similarity of thermal spectra of hadrons produced in heavy-ion collisions and
inclusive spectra which can be obtained within the dynamic quantum scattering
theory. Within the suggested approach we show that the mean square of the
transverse momentum for these partons grows and then saturates when the initial
energy increases. It leads to the energy dependence of hadron transverse mass
spectra which is similar to that observed in heavy ion collisions.
