the concept of biharmonic superspace (bi-HSS). It is an extension of the
N=4,d=1 superspace by two sets of harmonic variables associated with the two
SU(2) factors of the R-symmetry group SO(4) of the N=4, d=1 super Poincar\'e
algebra. There are three analytic subspaces in it: two of the Grassmann
dimension 2 and one of the dimension 3. They are closed under the
infinite-dimensional ""large"" N=4 superconformal group, as well as under the
finite-dimensional superconformal group D(2,1;\alpha). The main advantage of
the bi-HSS approach is that it gives an opportunity to treat N=4
supermultiplets with finite numbers of off-shell components on equal footing
with their ``mirror'' counterparts. We show how such multiplets and their
superconformal properties are described in this approach. We also define
nonpropagating gauge multiplets which can be used to gauge various isometries
of the bi-HSS actions. We present an example of nontrivial N=4 mechanics model

on gamma adiabatic index in the polytropic equation of state. This work is an
extension of Moscibrodzka & Proga (2008), where we investigated the gamma
dependence of 2-D Bondi-like accretion flows in the hydrodynamical (HD) limit.
Our main goal is to study if simulations for various gamma can give us insights
into to the problem of various modes of accretion observed in several types of
accretion systems such as black hole binaries (BHB), active galactic nuclei
(AGN), and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We find that for gamma >~ 4/3, the fast
rotating flow forms a thick torus that is supported by rotation and gas
pressure. As shown before for gamma=5/3, such a torus produces a strong,
persistent bipolar outflow that can significantly reduce the polar funnel
accretion of a slowly rotating flow. For low gamma, close to 1, the torus is
thin and is supported by rotation. The thin torus produces an unsteady outflow
which is too weak to propagate throughout the polar funnel inflow. Compared to
their HD counterparts, the MHD simulations show that the magnetized torus can
produce an outflow and does not exhibit regular oscillations. Generally, our
simulations demonstrate how the torus thickness affects the outflow production.
They also support the notion that the geometrical thickness of the torus
correlates with the power of the torus outflow. Our results, applied to
observations, suggest that the torus ability to radiatively cool and become
thin can correspond to a suppression of a jet as observed in the BHB during a
transition from a hard/low to soft/high spectral state and a transition from a
quiescent to hard/low state in AGN.

we reveal the prevailing existence of temperature substructures on ~100 kpc
scales in the central regions of nine intermediate-redshift (z~0.1) galaxy
clusters, which resemble those found in the Virgo and Coma Clusters. Each
substructure contains a clump of hot plasma whose temperature is about 2-3 keV
higher than the environment, corresponding to an excess thermal energy of
~1E58-1E60 erg per clump. Since if there were no significant non-gravitational
heating sources, these substructures would have perished in 1E8-1E9 yrs due to
thermal conduction and turbulent flows, whose velocity is found to range from
about 200 to 400 km/s, we conclude that the substructures cannot be created and
sustained by inhomogeneous radiative cooling. We also eliminate the
possibilities that the temperature substructures are caused by supernova
explosions, or by the non-thermal X-ray emission due to the
inverse-Comptonization of the CMB photons. By calculating the rising time of
AGN-induced buoyant bubbles, we speculate that the intermittent AGN outbursts
(~ 1E60 erg per burst) may have played a crucial role in the forming of the
high temperature substructures. Our results are supported by recent study of

generation for non-functional aspects including fault-tolerance mechanisms. One
crucial aspect in this context is to ensure that user-selected mechanisms for
the system model are sufficient to resist faults as specified in the underlying
fault hypothesis. In this paper, formal approaches in verification are proposed
to assist the claim. We first raise the precision of FTOS into pure
mathematical constructs, and formulate the deterministic assumption, which is
necessary as an extension of Giotto-like systems (e.g., FTOS) to equip with
fault-tolerance abilities. We show that local properties of a system with the
deterministic assumption will be preserved in a modified synchronous system
used as the verification model. This enables the use of techniques known from
hardware verification. As for implementation, we develop a prototype tool
called FTOS-Verify, deploy it as an Eclipse add-on for FTOS, and conduct
several case studies.

distributions on the vertices of a graph to various target distributions via
pebbling moves. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from a vertex and places
one pebble on one of its neighbors (losing the other as a toll). For t >= 1 the
t-pebbling number of a graph is the minimum number of pebbles necessary so that
from any initial distribution of them it is possible to move t pebbles to any
vertex. We provide the best possible upper bound on the t-pebbling number of a
diameter two graph, proving a conjecture of Curtis, et al., in the process. We
also give a linear time (in the number of edges) algorithm to t-pebble such
graphs, as well as a quartic time (in the number of vertices) algorithm to
compute the pebbling number of such graphs, improving the best known result of
Bekmetjev and Cusack. Furthermore, we show that, for complete graphs, cycles,
trees, and cubes, we can allow the target to be any distribution of t pebbles

this behavior holds for all graphs. Finally, we explore fractional and optimal
fractional versions of pebbling, proving the fractional pebbling number

universe. The fractality of time gives the fractality of space and mass. First
consequence is that the speed of light decreases inversely proportional to
time, same as the Hubble parameter. We then revise the universal constants and,
at the cosmological scale, they are all of order one, as Dirac proposed. We
find three different scales, each one separated by a factor of about 5x10^60:
the universe, the Planck scale and what we call the sub Planck scale.
Integration of the Einstein cosmological equations, for this fractal universe,

collisionless particles such that these particles go through the symmetry axis
of the cylinder, then the scalar polynomial singularity formed on the symmetry
axis is so weak that almost all of geodesics are complete, and thus effectively
no singularity forms by the collapse of a hollow dust cylinder. By contrast, in
this paper, we assume that whole of the collapsed dust settles down on the
symmetry axis by changing its equation of state. Obtained solutions are the
straightforward extension of Morgan's null dust solution, in which no

absorption line in the blue spectrum of HD 195592. These variations are ruled
by two time-scales respectively of 5.063 and about 20 days. The former is
firmly established, whilst the latter is poorly constrained. We report also on
a very significant line profile variability of the H $\beta$ line, with time
scales strongly related to those of the radial velocities. Our results provide
significant evidence that HD 195592 is a binary system, with a period that
might be the variability time-scale of about 5 days. The second time scale may
be the signature of an additional star moving along a wider orbit provided its
mass is low enough, even though direct evidence for the presence of a third
star is still lacking. Alternatively, the second time-scale may be the
signature of a variability intrinsic to the stellar wind of the primary,

various SN types, using a large sample of SN along with information on their

typical galaxian metallicities (using the well known metallicity-luminosity

latter case, we use the empirical fact that the metallicity gradients in disk
galaxies are ~ constant when expressed in dex/R25. Results: We confirm a
dependence of the N(Ibc)/N(II) ratio on metallicity; recent single star models
with rotation and binary star models with no rotation appear to reproduce
equally well that metallicity dependence. The size of our sample does not allow
significant conclusions on the N(Ic)/N(Ib) ratio. Finally, we find an

collapse supernovae, which we interpret in terms of the star formation

relativistic implementation to the modified dynamics paradigm, has fared quite
well as an alternative to dark matter, on both galactic and cosmological
scales. However, its performance in the solar system, as embodied in the
post-Newtonian formalism, has not yet been fully investigated. Tamaki has
recently attempted to calculate the preferred frame parameters for TeVeS, but
ignored the cosmological value of the scalar field, thus concluding that the
Newtonian potential must be static in order to be consistent with the vector
equation. We show that when the cosmological value of the scalar field is taken
into account, there is no constraint on the Newtonian potential; however, the
cosmological value of the scalar field is tightly linked to the vector field
coupling constant K, preventing the former from evolving as predicted by its
equation of motion. We then proceed to investigate the post-Newtonian limit of
a generalized version of TeVeS, with {\AE}ther type vector action, and show
that its \beta,\gamma and \xi parameters are as in GR, while solar system
constraints on the preferred frame parameters \alpha_1 and \alpha_2 can be
satisfied within a modest range of small values of the scalar and vector fields
coupling parameters, and for values of the cosmological scalar field consistent
with evolution within the framework of existing models.

analytic properties relating different matrixelements of the S-matrix or
formfactors, its relation to the localization- and positive energy spectral
principles requires a level of insight into the inner workings of QFT which
goes beyond anything which can be found in typical textbooks on QFT. This paper
presents a recent account based on new ideas derived from ""modular
localization"" including a mathematic appendix on this subject. Its main novel
achievement is the proof of the crossing property of formfactors from a
two-algebra generalization of the KMS condition. The main content of this
article is the presentation of the derailments of particle theory during more
than 4 decades: the S-matrix bootstrap, the dual model and its string theoretic
extension. Rather than being related to crossing, string theory is the (only
known) realization of a dynamic infinite component one-particle wave function
space and its associated infinite component field. Here ""dynamic"" means that,
unlike a mere collection of infinitely many irreducible unitary Poincar\'e
group representation or free fields, the formalism contains also operators
which communicate between the different irreducible Poincar\'e represenations
(the levels of the ""infinite tower"") and set the mass/spin spectrum. Wheras in
pre-string times there were unsuccessful attempts to achieve this in analogy to
the O(4,2) hydrogen spectrum by the use of higher noncompact groups, the
superstring in d=9+1, which uses instead (bosonic/fermionic) oscillators

reciprocity (also called generalized indirect reciprocity) is a type of
indirect reciprocity and represents the concept that those helped by somebody
will help other unspecified players. In spite of the evidence for the
enhancement of helping behavior by upstream reciprocity in rats and humans,
theoretical support for this mechanism is not strong. In the present study, we
numerically investigate upstream reciprocity in heterogeneous contact networks,
in which the players generally have different number of neighbors. We show that
heterogeneous networks considerably enhance cooperation in a game of upstream
reciprocity. In heterogeneous networks, the most generous strategy, by which a
player helps a neighbor on being helped and in addition initiates helping
behavior, first occupies hubs in a network and then disseminates to other
players. The scenario to achieve enhanced altruism resembles that seen in the
case of the Prisoner's Dilemma game in heterogeneous networks.

alone can easily produce ratios of nuclear (point source) to extended fluxes
comparable to those determined in studies of quasar hosts. This result suggests
that scattered quasar light, as well as stellar emission from the host galaxy,
contributes significantly to the detected extended flux, leading to uncertainty
in the inferred properties of quasar host. A significant contribution from
scattered quasar light will lead to overestimates of the luminosity and hence
mass of the host galaxy, and may also distort its morphology. Scattering of
quasar light within the host galaxy may provide alternative explanations for
the apparent peak in host luminosity at z = 2-3; possibly the overall average
higher luminosity of radio-loud host galaxies relative to those of radio-quiet
quasars (RQQs), and the apparent preference of high-luminosity RQQs for
spheroidal rather than disk galaxies.

different kinds of information between tasks or feature classes, but all three
are based on the information theoretic Minimum Description Length (MDL)
principle and share the same underlying Bayesian interpretation. The first
method, MIC, applies when predictive models are to be built simultaneously for
multiple tasks (``simultaneous transfer'') that share the same set of features.
MIC allows each feature to be added to none, some, or all of the task models
and is most beneficial for selecting a small set of predictive features from a
large pool of features, as is common in genomic and biological datasets. Our
second method, TPC (Three Part Coding), uses a similar methodology for the case
when the features can be divided into feature classes. Our third method,
Transfer-TPC, addresses the ``sequential transfer'' problem in which the task
to which we want to transfer knowledge may not be known in advance and may have
different amounts of data than the other tasks. Transfer-TPC is most beneficial
when we want to transfer knowledge between tasks which have unequal amounts of
labeled data, for example the data for disambiguating the senses of different
verbs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches with experimental
results on real world data pertaining to genomics and to Word Sense

the DMT optimality of a class of regularized lattice decoders, and more
importantly the DMT optimality of their lattice-reduction (LR)-aided linear
counterparts. The results hold for all channel statistics, for all channel
dimensions, and most interestingly, irrespective of the particular lattice-code
applied. As a special case, it is established that the LLL-based LR-aided
linear implementation of the MMSE-GDFE lattice decoder facilitates DMT optimal
decoding of any lattice code at a worst-case complexity that grows at most
linearly in the data rate. This represents a fundamental reduction in the
decoding complexity when compared to ML decoding whose complexity is generally
exponential in rate.
  The results' generality lends them applicable to a plethora of pertinent
communication scenarios such as quasi-static MIMO, MIMO-OFDM, ISI,
cooperative-relaying, and MIMO-ARQ channels, in all of which the DMT optimality
of the LR-aided linear decoder is guaranteed. The adopted approach yields
insight, and motivates further study, into joint transceiver designs with an

  Manuscrito",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper analyses the phenomenon of entanglement exchange in Bohm's pilot
wave interpretation of quantum mechanics. The interesting feature of the
phenomenon is that systems become entangled without causal interaction; hence
it is a useful situation for investigating the unique nature of interaction in
Bohmian mechanics. The first two sections introduce, respectively, entanglement
exchange in the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics, and the basic
principles of Bohmian mechanics. The next section shows that the Bohmian
interpretation makes the same experimental predictions about entanglement
exchange as the standard one. The final section draws some conclusions about
interactions and entanglement in Bohmian mechanics.

positive in the solar case, has been found to vary between -1 and 1 for other
stars. Our objective is to understand the factors influencing this correlation
in the solar case, and then to extrapolate our interpretation to other stars.
We characterize the correlation between both types of emission in the solar
case for different time scales. Then we determine the filling factors due to
plages and filaments, and reconstruct the Ca and Halpha emission to test
different physical conditions in terms of plage and filament contrasts. We have
been able to precisely determine the correlation in the solar case as a
function of the cycle phase. We interpret the results as reflecting the balance
between the emission in plages and the absorption in filaments. We found that
correlations close to zero or slightly negative can be obtained when
considering the same spatio-temporal distribution of plages and filaments than
on the sun but with greater contrast. However, with that assumption,
correlations close to -1 cannot be obtained for example. Stars with a very low
Halpha contrast in plages and filaments well correlated with plages could
produce a correlation close to -1. This study opens new ways to study stellar
activity, and provides a new diagnosis that will ultimately help to understand
the magnetic configuration of stars other than the sun.

magnetic behavior and ground state. Combining density functional electronic
structure and model calculations with thermodynamical measurements we reveal
the microscopic origin of this unexpected incident -- a crystal water driven
switching of the magnetically active orbitals. This switching results in a
fundamental change of the coupling regime from a three-dimensional
antiferromagnet to a quasi one-dimensional behavior. CuCl2 can be well
described as a frustrated J1-J2 Heisenberg chain with ferromagnetic exchange J1
and J2/J1 ~ -1.5 for which a helical ground state is predicted.

study non-dispersive, marginally unstable periodic orbits. Here we show that
the openness of the cavity to external fields presents unanticipated
consequences for the far-field distribution, including directional emission.
This is mediated by interactions of marginally unstable periodic orbits with
chaotic modes and is potentially relevant for the design of microcavity lasers.
We also show that such orbits are robust against perturbations to the shape of
the cavity, despite the non-generic character of the classical counterpart and
the lack of structural stability of the corresponding classical orbits.
